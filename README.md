# askFRED-v1-archive
An assorted archive of askfred.net v1, which will be deprecated beginning July 2, 2023.

Given the importance of AskFRED in the North American fencing community, the purpose of this archive is to preserve a key piece of sport fencing history and data. While the user-facing webpages will likely be available via Wayback Machine, it appears that at least some of the underlying fencing data won't be migrated to the new AskFRED.

This archive includes:
- The FRED REST API Webservices developer website and documentation.
- Data from the /v1 API endpoints.

I do not claim ownership of any data in this repository, unless otherwise specified. Any and all data belongs to either the owner(s) of AskFRED or the fencers/users themselves.
