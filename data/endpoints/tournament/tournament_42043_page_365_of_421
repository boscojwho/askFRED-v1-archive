The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf?_ga=2.44686689.433513283.1547236097-1943416123.1546365588 \r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament. Guides are a courtesy of fencing.net and the USFA.  \r\n\r\n PARENTS GUIDE TO FENCING:\r\n https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/fencing-for-parents  \r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS\r\nClick the Directions link on the FRED tournament home page.\r\n\r\nPARKING \r\nPlenty of parking at the venue. \r\n\r\nPUBLIC TRANSPORTATION:\r\nNJFA is conveniently located near all major highways in NJ, NY, CT, and Pennsylvania.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector.

Eligibility is NOT restricted to those residing or attending HS in the State of Tennessee. Participants are NOT required to have a USA Fencing Membership, however those who have a High School Membership or Competitive Membership with USA Fencing will be eligible to earn ratings (where applicable). Participants who do not have either of the mentioned memberships, are not eligible to earn a rating, however they will be considered part of the total field when determining the event classification. Entry fee is $15\/event.\r\n\r\n=== Tennessee State High School Individual Champions ===\r\n\r\nTournament Format: Each event will consist of 1 round of pools with 100% Promotion, followed by a standard Direct Elimination table.\r\nContested Events (6): Men's Epee, Men's Saber, Men's Foil, Women's Epee, Women's Saber, and Women's Foil.\r\n\r\nFinal placement from each event will determine the \"TN State HS Individual Champion\" in that event. Awards will be given to each finalist (top 3 finishers in each event). There is no limit as to how many fencers from each High School can participate in a single event. There is also no limit as to how many events a single individual can participate in. Prior to the start of the tournament, any individual fencing in more than one event must designate which event's result will be considered when calculating the \"TN State HS Squad Champion\". Although a single fencer may compete and even win the 'Individual State Championship' in multiple weapons, they can only use results from one predetermined event, towards the 'Squad' and 'Overall Team' Championships.\r\n\r\n=== Tennessee State High School Squad Champions ===\r\n\r\nUsing the final results from each individual event, points will be awarded to each participant using the following formula: ((# entries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points *The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThe fencers who combine for the highest total points in an event (maximum of three fencers\/event) will be considered the \"TN State HS Squad Champions\", however the fencers must be from the same HS. Separate Men's and Women's Squad Champions will be awarded in each weapon.\r\n\r\n=== Tennessee State High School Overall Team Champions ===\r\n\r\nUsing the same process as described above, the HS that combines for the most points across all three weapons is the \"Tennessee State High School Overall Team Champion\".

Competitors regularly attend from the East Coast and visitors from farther away are always welcome (and can occasionally find a Vet fencer to host those who need a place to stay). \r\n \r\nIn addition to events in the NY\/NJ\/CT tri-state region, this year the Cup will add an event in the Washington DC area for the first time!\r\n\r\nCUP POINTS\r\n \r\nIn addition to individual event awards, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in Cup Point Standings at the end of the season will be recognized, with awards given at the season's final event. In the case of a tie, the higher ranking will go to the fencer that received the highest number of points in a single event across the Cup. 2019-2020 Cup Points will be awarded to fencers as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Points from up to four (4) 2019-2020 Cup events.\r\n2. For each event, participating fencers will receive points based on the number and letter rating of other participants who finish below them:\r\na. Each participating fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)  \r\nb. Participating fencers will earn points equal to the total point value of all fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points \r\nc.

WE WILL ANNOUNCE THE RESCHEDULED DATE AS SOON AS WE ARE ABLE. \r\n\r\nThis tournament provides a qualification path for Y14 EVENTS AT SUMMER NATIONALS.\r\n\r\nCost Information:\r\n\r\nThe cost for each event is $40 if preregistered through askFRED.net before registration closes (03\/25\/20). All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60. All fencers who have not paid through askFRED before registration closes will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdincomplete\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd registrant on FRED\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes.

Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply.

I am sure that you understand that many other USA Fencing Divisions across our nation are facing similar predicaments.\r\n\r\nHowever, in that same communication, the National Office also indicated that they would be examining other possible qualification paths and that they would follow up with the fencing community on Thursday, April 9th. \r\n\r\nHere is the link to the communication which can be found on the usfencing.org website.\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/news_article\/show\/1098633?fbclid=IwAR0QfMn_qKsBRo7VV3YptSzJzPxuryDR1gX2aeC3sKgoNmByoeQKAhHJQ94\r\n\r\nBecause we do not know at this time what those qualification paths will be, we are asking you if you have not already paid for your registration to fence in our SNQ (and still wish to fence), that you do so by SUNDAY, MARCH 29, 11:59 p.m. (The day the SNQ was originally scheduled). This is because if you are interested in competing, we will have a concrete number of fencers for us to plan and staff for if we are able to have a qualifier in May. If the amended qualification path possibly includes submitting the names of those who were interested in competing to the National Office, we have your names as well.\r\n\r\nIf you have already paid and registered, you do not need to do anything. \r\n\r\nThe stated deadline on the USA Fencing website for divisions to submit their list of qualified fencers is June 1, which means we have only after May 4th to schedule the SNQ in New Jersey. \r\n\r\nIf we do not run a SNQ, we will refund both your registration and event fee minus the askfred.net fee (which is $1.49 as far as we can tell). \r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your understanding.\r\n\r\nAll those who wish to fence in the Summer National Qualifier must pay the registration and tournament fee by 11:59 P.M. Sunday, March 29, 2020. There will be no late fee, but you MUST pay the registration and tournament fee before the stated date and time.\r\n\r\nThis means payment must be completed online at AskFred.net. IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID, YOU ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE REGISTERED. \r\n\r\nTHERE WILL BE NO WALK-INS and NO REGISTRATIONS WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THIS DEADLINE. THERE WILL BE NO EXCEPTIONS.\r\n\r\nPLEASE MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE AN EMAIL THAT YOU WILL CHECK REGULARLY INCLUDED ON YOUR REGISTRATION INFORMATION.  \r\n\r\nIF BY ANY CHANCE THE SUMMER NATIONAL QUALIFIER IS NOT HELD, YOUR REGISTRATION AND EVENT FEES WILL BE REFUNDED, MINUS THE ASKFRED.NET FEE. \r\n\r\nPlease check this page frequently for updates. TOURNAMENT DATES AND TIMES WILL BE ANNOUNCED VIA THIS PAGE.\r\n\r\nPREVIOUS INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nThis tournament is the qualification path for New Jersey Division Fencers who wish to compete in the Division II or Division III Summer National events and who have not already qualified for Div 2\/3 through a Regional Open Championship (ROC) event. \r\n\r\nOne registration, one event with two outcomes, one for Div 2 and the other for Div 3.

WE WILL ANNOUNCE THE RESCHEDULED DATE AS SOON AS WE ARE ABLE. \r\n\r\nThis tournament provides a qualification path for DIV 2\/3 EVENTS AT SUMMER NATIONALS.\r\n\r\nCost Information:\r\n\r\nThe cost for each event is $40 if preregistered through askFRED.net before registration closes (the Wednesday before the event). All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdincomplete\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd registrant on FRED\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nFencers competing in Div 2\/3 events must follow the rating restrictions set forth by the USFA. Only fencers with a rating of C or lower are eligible to fence at these qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

Two non profit organizations that were important to Chuck were the Amarillo Competitive Fencing Association and The Bridge Children's Advocacy Center. You know about ACFA, but please visit http:\/\/www.bridgecac.org\/ to find out more info about The Bridge. \r\n\r\nChuck Slaughter started his fencing odyssey with his son, Jared, in Coach Howard's adult continuing education classes at Amarillo College. After developing a passion for fencing, Chuck started the youth fencing continuing education class in 2001. In his time as a coach and instructor at Amarillo College and the Amarillo Competitive Fencing Association he taught hundreds of ordinary adults and kids how to be better athletes and better members of society. Chuck expanded his fencing knowledge by earning certification with the United States Fencing Coaches Association and by learning one-on-one with an Olympic coach. The fencers Chuck taught ranged from weekend warriors, NCAA fencers, multiple national finalists, and a national champion. He spent countless hours coaching and teaching fencing three times a week for 15 years. He even traveled with his fencers to tournaments on his own dime all across the country and even to Europe. \r\nIn 2006, he was selected as the United States Fencing Association Volunteer Coach of the Year. In the same year he was also a finalist for the United States Olympic Committee Volunteer Coach of the Year. In 2009, he was awarded a United States Fencing Coach Medal when he coached Juleah Nusz to a national championship. He was even featured on an episode of Texas Country Reporter.\r\nChuck didn't coach for fame or money; he coached because he loved to teach and he loved his fencers. So many current and former AC fencers can trace life lessons back to what they learned from Chuck and the experiences they shared with him. There is no way any of us can replace Chuck or his passion. We each have our own Chuck stories. Early in the youth program, at an RYC in El Paso someone from Dallas asked Chuck what European style he taught. His answer: Amarillo style. His student went on to win the tournament.\r\n\r\nDATE\r\nApril 4, 2020\r\n\r\nVENUE\r\nAmarillo College\r\nCarter Fitness Center & AC Fencing Salle\r\nCorner of 24th Street & Washington\r\nAmarillo, TX 79109\r\n\r\nBOUT COMMITTEE AND FOC\r\nBout Committee Contact Info: acfencer@gmail.com\r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED\r\nFencing will commence for each event as soon as possible after close of registration.

yet have proper fencing knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers in Y12 and above events will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow like: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Pitt Meadows Heritage Hall","address":"12460 Harris Road","city":"Pitt

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, you will not able to pre-register for FAP events for the rest of the season. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-register and cannot show up, please remove your name from the pre-registration list IN A TIMELY MANNER (more than 24 hours prior) as a courtesy to others who expect the tournament to run if it has six fencers registered the day of the event.  When you remove your name from the list the day of the event THAT IS A NO SHOW.  You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.
