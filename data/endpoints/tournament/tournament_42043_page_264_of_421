All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $50.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an \u0093incomplete\u0094 registrant on FRED\u0092s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nFencers competing in Div 2\/3 events must follow the rating restrictions set forth by the USFA. Only fencers with a rating of C or lower are eligible to fence at these qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\n<b>Uniform Requirements:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.

The objective is to provide Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers with individual club fencing qualification based on the series of tournaments throughout 2015-2016 fencing season. Each participant will be awarded with a number of points earned in a specific event at each competition. Each age group belongs to a specific Maximum Points bracket:\r\n\r\nAge Group Max. Points\r\nY10 50\r\nY12 100\r\nY14 200\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the earned Points at each event is as follows:\r\n\r\n((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x Maximum Points\r\n\r\n1st place receives the Maximum Points, while all consecutive places will receive the corresponding Points calculated through the above formula. All points will be rounded-up in case of the results with decimals. Below are several examples:\r\n\r\nY10 event of 10 fencers:\r\n1 = 50\r\n2 = 45\r\n3 = 40\r\n...\r\n10 = 5\r\n\r\nY12 event of 8 fencers:\r\n1 = 100\r\n2 = 88\r\n3 = 75\r\n...\r\n8 = 13\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of earned points for the Cup Series will be a sum of points earned in each competition, but will be limited to a specific age group and a weapon (if a fencer participates in several age group and weapon events).\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.
