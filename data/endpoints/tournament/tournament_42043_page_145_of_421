Equipment check will be open each day of the competition at the same times doors open.  (Armory has indicated they may also be available on Thursday evening for initial events on Friday and an email will be sent via askFRED to confirm the times). \r\n\r\nEquipment check will test the mask, lame jacket, gloves and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\" \r\n\r\nAll events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: underarm protector, plastron (if required), 2nd weapon and 2nd body cord, and weapon check control marks. \r\n\r\nAthletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between prior to beginning events on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly. Those fencing early on Friday, Saturday or Sunday can have their equipment checked the day before.\r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance of Thursday, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.  Once marked for the tournament, it is good for the whole weekend.\r\n\r\nNote that Sword Masters will be on site with repair services and to sell new equipment, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order. \r\n\r\nNames on uniforms will NOT be required per YDC update.\r\n\r\n<b>AIRPORTS<\/b>\r\nThe Columbus Airport is Port Columbus International Airport ( CMH ).  http:\/\/arnoldsportsfestival.com\/airlines\/\r\n\r\n<b>HOTEL INFORMATION<\/b>\r\nThere are several venue hotels.

A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still\r\nparticipating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we\r\nwill show you). US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is not required as these are not sanctioned\r\nevents. These events are not rated and you cannot get a classification change from this event.\r\n\r\nEntry Fee\r\n\r\nThe basic entry fee is $5 per fencer per event. Electric equipment rental is $10 per event.\r\n\r\nElectric Equipment\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to\r\narrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you\r\nwill need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through\r\nan electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing.\r\n\r\nTournament Format\r\n\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with a round of pools and 100% promotion to direct eliminations.

Participation qualifies fencers for both the Y10\/Y12 competitions at North American Cups, while the winners of the Y-14 events are qualified for Summer Nationals. With this in mind, the Y14 events will be run as a combined pool round and then the DEs will be split into boys\/girls, with the winner of each qualifying for SN. \r\n\r\nAll fencers must be a current USFA member (or complete the application at the door), and bring their membership card.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73957,"tournament_id":17589,"tournament":"Div. 3 Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":24,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-03-04T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17597,"name":"NEUSFA - Y14 Foil \/ Sabre @ BFC","start_date":"2012-03-04","end_date":"","comments":"Y14 Mens & Womens Foil & Sabre @ BFC. \r\n \r\n$15 online registration, closes Wednesday before the event.\r\n$40 walk-in fee.","prereg_open":"2012-01-24","prereg_close":"2012-02-29","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Boston Fencing Club","address":"110 Clematis Ave","city":"Waltham","state":"MA","zip":"02453-7013","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":42.3838776,"longitude":-71.2017328,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73974,"tournament_id":17597,"tournament":"NEUSFA - Y14 Foil \/ Sabre @ BFC","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-03-04T08:30:00-08:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":73977,"tournament_id":17597,"tournament":"NEUSFA - Y14 Foil \/ Sabre @ BFC","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":33,"prereg_count":31,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-03-04T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":73978,"tournament_id":17597,"tournament":"NEUSFA - Y14 Foil \/ Sabre @ BFC","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-03-04T13:30:00-08:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":15811,"name":"Y14 Saber Liberty Cup #3","start_date":"2012-03-04","end_date":"","comments":"$35 for MFC members with prepayment in MFC office, $40 for non members, or $50 without any prepayment at the door.

The CFF Competition Rules allow for up to 5 individuals of the opposite gender to the competition to be mixed in \u0096 the event will still be ranked as a single event. Your points will show up for that weapon and age group.\r\n\r\n---------- EQUIPMENT: ----------\r\nAll entrants must wear proper protective equipment (fencing jacket, sous plastron, breeches, mask and glove) during competition. Masks must pass a punch test (FIE label not required) and be stamped prior to the event. All fencers must wear a plastron (350 N or higher underarm protector) at all times.

IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB.\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park. On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $6.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map.\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n---------- HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS: ----------\r\nAccommodations at the University of British Columbia are available for those who wish to stay on campus for the tournament. Reservations can be booked online.\r\nMore information can be found here: http:\/\/www.ubcconferences.com\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc@gmail.com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1Z1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.2683236,"longitude":-123.2504661,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":72955,"tournament_id":17303,"tournament":"2012 Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Senior Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":31,"prereg_count":33,"is_team":false,"description":"Senior","close_of_reg":"2012-03-10T09:15:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":72956,"tournament_id":17303,"tournament":"2012 Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Men's Senior Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":11,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"Senior","close_of_reg":"2012-03-10T11:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":72958,"tournament_id":17303,"tournament":"2012 Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Junior Mixed Saber","short_name":"JrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-03-10T15:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":73464,"tournament_id":17303,"tournament":"2012 Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Women's Senior Saber","short_name":"WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"Senior","close_of_reg":"2012-03-10T13:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":73465,"tournament_id":17303,"tournament":"2012 Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Men's Senior Saber","short_name":"MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"Senior","close_of_reg":"2012-03-10T13:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":73466,"tournament_id":17303,"tournament":"2012 Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Women's Senior Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"Senior","close_of_reg":"2012-03-10T11:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17569,"name":"Dublin Team Invitational","start_date":"2012-03-10","end_date":"","comments":"This team event is open to high school students.
