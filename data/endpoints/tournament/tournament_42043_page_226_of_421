The tournament will follow the typical USFA format. Fencer\u0092s will be initially seeded and broken up into pools. The fencers will then be placed into a tournament bracket and will compete until one fencer emerges as the winner. Medals will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, & 3rd place.\r\n\r\nFencers will also earn points based on where they finish in the event. The three best finishes from each competitor will be added together to create the overall score. The three competitors with the highest point totals will receive additional awards following the completion of the fourth event. This format favors not just the most skilled fencer, but also the most consistent and the most dedicated. The more events you fence, the better shot you have of taking home the grand prize.\r\n\r\nThe overall leader will be declared the Epee Grand Champion and will receive a custom-made championship belt to honor their achievement. \r\nPoints will be awarded as follows:\r\nEach direct elimination bout victory earns 3 points\r\nEach direct elimination bout loss earns 1 point\r\n\r\nONLY YOUR THREE BEST TOURNAMENT FINISHES WILL BE COUNTED TOWARDS YOUR OVERALL SCORE.\r\n\r\nThis is a non-USFA event. Masks will be the only equipment checked prior to the start of competition. All fencers must wear full fencing gear including knickers and a plastron. We will not be requiring two weapons and two bodycords for each competitor, but we do request that you bring enough working equipment to see you through the end of the event. Weights and shims will be tested during the tournament to insure fairness. We will have the proper testing equipment on site, and recommend testing before the event. The event will be self-refereed by competitors designated before the start of competition.\r\n\r\nWe will have at least 5 fully operational electric strips on hand in order to ensure that this event is completed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on: 09\/26\/2014\r\nPreregistration closes on: 11\/09\/2014\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"En Garde Fencing Club","address":"352 Butler Street","city":"Etna","state":"PA","zip":"15223","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.496241,"longitude":-79.94392,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":32,"name":"Western Pennsylvania","abbrev":"WPA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":110937,"tournament_id":28051,"tournament":"The En Garde Epee Championship Series: November","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":15,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-09T17:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28062,"name":"Cranberry Tournament 2014","start_date":"2014-11-09","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2014-09-28","prereg_close":"2014-11-05","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":5,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"USFA Membership required; all foil fencers are required to wear a lame overlay on the lower bib portion of their mask; all other events require regular competition gear; fencers are required to have two weapons and two body cords with them on the strip;\r\n\r\nA pre-registration fee of $5.00 is required when registering on ASKFRED.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot on Glenside Avenue.  There is an entrance on Rices Mill Road as well as the one in the parking lot behind the building on Glenside Avenue.  Bring food and drink, the only close food is Chinese.  \r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur new space is still limited as we are awaiting the installation of our new floor,and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108117,"tournament_id":27333,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Y12 Foil ","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-09T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28127,"name":"Turkey Stab Mixed Open","start_date":"2014-11-09","end_date":"","comments":"Cost: $25 first weapon, $15 second, $10 third\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil 9:00 AM\r\nMixed Saber 12:00 Noon\r\nMixed Epee 2:00 PM","prereg_open":"2014-10-06","prereg_close":"2014-11-08","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Cost: $25 first weapon, $15 second, $10 third\r\n<br>\r\nEvents Scheduled:<br>\r\nMixed Foil 9:00 AM<br>\r\nMixed Saber 12:00 Noon<br>\r\nMixed Epee 2:00 PM<br><br>\r\n\r\nCome celebrate Thanksgiving a little bit early at Oberlin's annual Turkey Stab tournament!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/06\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/08\/2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Hales Gymnasium","address":"180 W Lorain Street","city":"Oberlin","state":"OH","zip":"44074","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.2942356,"longitude":-82.2239561,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":21,"name":"Northern Ohio","abbrev":"NOOH","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":111334,"tournament_id":28127,"tournament":"Turkey Stab Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-09T08:45:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":111335,"tournament_id":28127,"tournament":"Turkey Stab Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-09T11:45:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":111336,"tournament_id":28127,"tournament":"Turkey Stab Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":19,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-09T13:45:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28137,"name":"ICFC November Open","start_date":"2014-11-09","end_date":"","comments":"Come join us for some fencing fun!

RYC serve as a qualifying path for Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. The top 50% (Y12) and 25% (Y14) on each Regions RRPS will earn qualification to their respective event at that seasons Summer National Championships. (Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at SNs will be National Championships. The Y10 path to qualification remains participation in an RYC or SYC = qualification. Y12 has been adjusted from participation to a top 50% qualification standard. Y14 has been adjusted from the winner of an RYC earns qualification to the top 25% on the RRPS. NRPS earned at SYC or NAC tournaments remain a qualifying path as does the Y14 Divisional qualifier. The qualifying standards for the Youth NAC have NOT changed)\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Given the current number and concentration of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, it was determined that up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. For more details on this initiative, visit http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/3283\/2014-2015_Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative.pdf\r\n\r\nForeign fencers can compete at any RYC. If they compete out of Region they will not appear on that Region\u0092s Point List nor will points from an outside region transfer to an athletes point total in their home region. Railstation will sort them out. However, their participation will be counted in the overall entrants and be included when the points are calculated for the fencers who competed in their home region. A fencer can ONLY win the Regional Patch Award for the Region they reside in. \r\n\r\nQualification: \r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10\/12\/14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament requirements. \r\n\r\nQualification paths for Y10\/12\/14 are maintained in the Athletes Handbook (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook).\r\n\r\nSummer National Championships: Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, the Y10 and Y12 events at Summer Nationals will be designated as National Championship Events.

Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Each event consists of two rounds (pools and DE (direct elimination). \r\nPools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round. \r\nDirect Elimination: DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. \r\nY10 DE format: Y10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 touches or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nY12\/Y14 DE format: Y12 and Y14 DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break between) During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\r\n\u0095 No fence-off for third place; Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc . Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT PREPARATION\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide (courtesy of fencing.net) http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html \r\n\r\nParents Guide to Fencing (courtesy of Fencing.net) http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html \r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\nHOST HOTEL:\r\n\r\nCountry Inn & Suites Grand Rapids East\r\nAddress: 3251 Deposit Drive NE, Grand Rapids, MI\r\n\r\nFriday 2 Queen Beds $110\r\nSaturday 2 Queen Beds $117 \r\nFree breakfast: Sat-Sun 7:00 \u0096 10:30 am\r\n\r\nPlenty of the restaurants withing a very short drive\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Grand Rapids Fencing Academy","address":"1345 Monroe Av NW, Suite #102","city":"Grand Rapids","state":"MI","zip":"49505","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":42.9876333,"longitude":-85.6713343,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":20,"name":"Michigan","abbrev":"MI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":107488,"tournament_id":27165,"tournament":"RYC - VI Annual Grand Rapids Youth Cup","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":20,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-16T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":107489,"tournament_id":27165,"tournament":"RYC - VI Annual Grand Rapids Youth Cup","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-15T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":107490,"tournament_id":27165,"tournament":"RYC - VI Annual Grand Rapids Youth Cup","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":23,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-15T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":110557,"tournament_id":27165,"tournament":"RYC - VI Annual Grand Rapids Youth Cup","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-15T10:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":110558,"tournament_id":27165,"tournament":"RYC - VI Annual Grand Rapids Youth Cup","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-15T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":110559,"tournament_id":27165,"tournament":"RYC - VI Annual Grand Rapids Youth Cup","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-15T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":110561,"tournament_id":27165,"tournament":"RYC - VI Annual Grand Rapids Youth Cup","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-16T11:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27694,"name":"Genesis Classic","start_date":"2014-11-15","end_date":"","comments":"Y12 Mix Foil - 9am (non sanctioned)\r\nY12 Mix Epee - 9am (non sanctioned)\r\nOpen Foil Mix - 1pm (sanctioned)\r\nOpen Epee Mix - 1pm (sanctioned)\r\nUSFA rules enforced for sanctioned events.\r\n30$\/event\r\nFloor: bouncy plastic tiles.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2013-14 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2014, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1994-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1995-2001 and for the cadet events 1998-2001.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"191 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10021","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661332,"longitude":-73.979319,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":110579,"tournament_id":27960,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Epee","short_name":"CdWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-16T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":110580,"tournament_id":27960,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-16T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":110581,"tournament_id":27960,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-16T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":110582,"tournament_id":27960,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-16T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]}]}
