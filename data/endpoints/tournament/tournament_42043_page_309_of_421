They are approximately a 8 minute walk from TFC. Please park toward the street and avoid their customers or the north wall where their associates park. It is suggested that fencers be dropped off with their gear at the front of the venue before parking cars. Note that the Walmart is a grocery outlet and carries full line of sport drinks, fruits and snacks.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/20\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/01\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":150533,"tournament_id":37901,"tournament":"Liberty Fencing Club - High School Three-Weapon","full_name":"Junior Men's High School Saber","short_name":"JrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2017-12-02T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150534,"tournament_id":37901,"tournament":"Liberty Fencing Club - High School Three-Weapon","full_name":"Junior Women's High School Saber","short_name":"JrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2017-12-02T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150537,"tournament_id":37901,"tournament":"Liberty Fencing Club - High School Three-Weapon","full_name":"Junior Men's High School Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2017-12-03T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150538,"tournament_id":37901,"tournament":"Liberty Fencing Club - High School Three-Weapon","full_name":"Junior Women's High School Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2017-12-03T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150539,"tournament_id":37901,"tournament":"Liberty Fencing Club - High School Three-Weapon","full_name":"Junior Men's High School Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2017-12-03T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150540,"tournament_id":37901,"tournament":"Liberty Fencing Club - High School Three-Weapon","full_name":"Junior Women's High School Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2017-12-03T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":38673,"name":"Houston Cup #3","start_date":"2017-12-02","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2017-11-27","prereg_close":"2017-12-01","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Houston Cup #3 is the second out of 8 Houston Cup tournaments that run during 2017-18 season.\r\n\r\nSignature Houston Cup medals for the top 4 finishers.\r\nSignature Houston Cup trophy for the best points standing fencer after 8 tournaments.\r\n\r\nTournament to be held at Alliance Fencing Academy\/Houston: \r\n\r\n1212A Cedar Post Lane\r\nHouston, TX. 77055\r\n\r\nIf Y10, Y12 and Y14 Women's or Men's events have less than 8 fencers in attendance we will combine the events on the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nClose of registration:\r\n\r\n8:00AM: Youth-10 Men's and Women's Epee\r\n9:00AM: Youth-8 Mixed Epee\r\n10:00AM:Youth-14 Men's and Women's Epee\r\n12:00PM: Youth-12 Men's and Women's Epee\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIVER REQUIRED: Please pre-print and bring waiver to event.

commence immediately afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a stoppage at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events will be sanctioned and require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nY8, Y10 and Y12 events require a minimum of 4 fencers.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events require a minimum of 6 fencers for sanctioning.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of fencers of each gender.\r\n\r\nFees:\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\nTournament Rules:\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\nCFF Licenses:\r\nAll participating fencers will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\nFencing Equipment:\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or

Medals and classifications will be awarded.\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2017-2018 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-Lambertville Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free onsite parking! Free wireless internet!\r\n\r\n10 minute walk on scenic tow path to historic Lambertville full of shops & dining!\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership.
