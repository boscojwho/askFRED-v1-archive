Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1998-2001\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1996-1999\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=14913\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/29\/2011\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

It marks the victory of a poorly trained and equipped army of approximately 4,500 over the much larger professional force of 6,500 sent by Napoleon the III to reestablish a French foothold in the Americas. While the French were able to control much of the country a year latter with the help of 30,000 reinforcements, Mexico eventually defeated the French who left the country for good in 1867. It would the last time a European power attempted to recolonize the Americas.\r\n \r\nThe Cinco de Mayo tournament not only commemorates this date but also celebrates that Mexico is probably the first place in the Americas that established a fencing school. The first official reference to fencing as a sport on the continent is contained in an official document dated 1730 that limited who could establish a fencing school in Mexico to \u00e2\u0080\u009call those persons who are physically capable of giving these lessons and who can show that they hold the indispensible title of fencing master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n \r\n--------- Prizes ----------\r\n1.

This team will be headed by one or two coaches, chosen from all of that school district\u0092s coaches.  Normally there is a participation limit of one girls team and one boys team per school district, but this year we are waiving this rule in order to field as many teams possible.  Therefore each school district may enter as many teams and fencers as they wish for the All-State tournament.  \r\n\r\nAs an example of how we in the San Francisco High School District choose our All-State team.  We select our team members at our S.F. All-City Tournament, which is held at the end of the fencing season at an individual boys and girls event.  For the boy\u0092s team, up to an additional four boys are voted by all coaches as the All-City Team.  At the end of the All-City Meet, a boy\u0092s team and girl\u0092s team plus coaches are selected from all of our high schools to represent San Francisco in the All-State Tournament.\r\n\r\nThe All-State tournament this year will host girls and boys individual events.  We encourage each district to field any number of girls they wish in a girl\u0092s individual tournament.  The format for both the boys and girls events will be pools, followed by direct eliminations with fence-off for third, where points will be earned by the final placing.  The total points for the top three placing girls or boys from each district will be added together to determine the first place school districts in the girls and boys teams event.  \r\nThe first place team trophy for boys and the first place team trophy for girls are perpetual trophies, which have been in the school systems for years.\r\n\r\nTo enter a team, a letter requesting a seat in the All-State tournament is needed from each school district wishing to participate.  \r\nThis letter is required, along with $30.00 (to cover the costs of prizes and gym rental).  Please make out the check to Pannonia Athletic Club, and bring both to the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst place boys team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\nFirst place girls team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\n\r\nThere will also be 24 medals awarded for:\r\n\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place teams (boys and girls, 3 medals per team)\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place individual(boys and girls)\r\n\r\nNO USFA membership is required, no ratings will be awarded. \r\nAll other USFA rules and regulations apply.\r\n\r\n<\/div>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 04\/19\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/29\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"University High School, Lower Campus - Herbst Gym","address":"3185 Washington St (at Lyon)","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","zip":"94115","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":6,"name":"Northern California","abbrev":"NORCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":64089,"tournament_id":14959,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Men's High School Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2011-04-30T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":64090,"tournament_id":14959,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Women's High School   Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"High School  ","close_of_reg":"2011-04-30T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14193,"name":"The Pirate Olympics","start_date":"2011-04-30","end_date":"","comments":"Please see the More Info  or www.eastofthecooperfencing.com.
