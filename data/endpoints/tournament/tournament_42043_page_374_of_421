We will be live streaming the events on our Facebook page so those that want to watch but can't attend due to this guideline can do so.\r\n\r\n4) Fencers are asked to leave once their event is finished to minimize the number of people in the school at one time.

We understand a lot of clubs aren't active during COVID re-opening, and people are going from place to place. We have an associate membership for people who want to fence here while retaining a primary membership elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNormally it's $60 per month if you're committed to 12 months.\r\n\r\nFor August, September and October we're discounting it to $45. You can pay by paypal for a single month, for all three months, or subscribe to pay monthly for three months.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to come for open bouting any night we are having bouting. Since we're offering at least two nights per week for each weapon this can save you money over the floor fee.\r\n\r\nSo if you're looking to get some bouting in, whether your club is available or not, we wanted to make this option available to people in the community, to get good bouting with cool people from various clubs in a nice setting.\r\n\r\nLinks are included for the floor fee, or the discounted associate membership option.\r\n\r\nAssociate Single Month Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DKRMZMFHQD232\r\n\r\nAssociate Three Months Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PT5P6H55MFWPN\r\n\r\nAssociate Member 3 Month Subscription Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZTSKC3QUDBRFQ\r\n\r\nFloor Fee Single Night\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RCKLX79XB7C2L\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Limit 13 fencers Foil\r\n\r\nSafety Measures\r\n\r\nBaltimore County is now requiring masks for all indoor activities therefore masks will be worn throughout practice.

This is good for everyone. As such we beg your understanding and patience as we implement the following...read on. This plan complies with CDC guidelines...no one is getting sick here on my watch. htps:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/covid \r\n\r\n1) *Time change.* We moved the Men's to 10 am and the women's to 3 pm. \r\n\r\n2) We have opened the registration accepting a max of 42 fencers in hopes we can draw the minimum 25. Spread the word and help us promote to make this an A2 event.\r\n\r\n3) If we draw more than 21 fencers we will \"flight\" pools so you should be prepared for a delay either on the front or back end (approx. 1.5 to 2 hrs). Note to remain in compliance with CDC guidelines athletes NOT fencing will be asked to leave the building and return at a designated time for their pool round. We have plenty of outdoor undercover seating for you to enjoy but equally our town has many places you can go and sit and relax. Athletes will  be given time to warm up before pools and DE. Plan ahead, bring a book, school work etc.  No coaches permitted during the pool round but yes for De's.\r\n\r\n4) DE's will be an orderly process and will take place 10 minutes after the table is posted for your review.  Initially, athletes will be outside as we call in the fencers and those on deck who may enter the building with their coaches. Those on double deck will be notified and so on. \r\nCoaches will be permitted to enter with their athletes for the DE rounds. Once we are in the round of 16 everyone can stay in the building.  \r\n\r\n5) Payment is required in advance (no door payments accepted or walk in's) Zelle, Venmo or Credit Card only. 100% refund if you need to cancel, for any reason, 24 hours prior to the event. Payment links found here...  https:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/cart\r\n\r\n6) I will hire more ref's to make this go fast. If you know of any certified ref's (6 or better preferred) please send them our WAY. \r\n\r\n7) I am working on fencing time live results for you as we speak\r\n\r\n8) NEW coaches boxes will be created for coaches during the DE rounds. Yes, Coaches will be permitted during the DE's, but NOT the pool rounds.  \r\n\r\nWe can pull this off only with your support and understanding. If you're not loving this idea, bail out now, we don't need any naysayers on game day. Let's make this a day filled with positivity, good vibes and even better fencing.  \r\n\r\nCoach Mike Martin\r\nOwner\r\nhttps:\/\/wayofthesword.org by day\r\nhttp:\/\/Ridgefieldrave.com by night ","venue":{"name":"Way of the Sword Fencing","address":"21 Governor Street","city":"Ridgefield","state":"CT","zip":"06877","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.2812523,"longitude":-73.4972894,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184293,"tournament_id":46856,"tournament":"WAY Epic Epee: Men's A2* push & Women's Open","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-12-13T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":184294,"tournament_id":46856,"tournament":"WAY Epic Epee: Men's A2* push & Women's Open","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":40,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-12-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47166,"name":"Cyr and CFA's December Foil: E and und plus Youth","start_date":"2020-12-13","end_date":"","comments":"Cyrano's Place and Cleveland Fencing Academy join forces to bring you:\r\n\r\nFoil tournament for E and under, Novice Y10\/12 and Y12\/14.

Due to the COVID pandemic we are going to follow the guidelines listed below. There will be no exceptions to the guidelines so please do not ask. \r\n\r\nCOVID guidelines:\r\n\r\n1) Anyone who enters the school must wear a facial mask at all times. The only exception is when either getting a drink or a bite of food. The mask must cover both the nose and mouth. Fencers will be expected to wear a mask while fencing. Disposable masks will be available for those who forget.\r\n\r\n2) Anyone who enters the school will be subject to a temperature check using a standard infrared forehead thermometer.\r\n\r\n3) Fencers are only allowed to bring one guest with them. We will be live streaming the events on our Facebook page so those that want to watch but can't attend due to this guideline can do so.\r\n\r\n4) Fencers are asked to leave once their event is finished to minimize the number of people in the school at one time. In addition we have added more time between events to minimize overlap.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nAll events are mixed senior events for ages 13 and up. Event Format will be standard 5-point pool bouts with 100% promotion to direct elimination. Direct eliminations will be a 15 point bout format with medals for the top 4 places.
