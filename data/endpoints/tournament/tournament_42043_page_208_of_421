ALL EVENTS ARE CFF SANCTIONED.\r\nNational domestic ranking points are earned on the senior ranking for senior events, and the junior ranking for junior events.\r\n\r\nNote: Events will be cancelled if there are less than 6 people registered \u0096 those fencers who have registered will then be asked if they wish to participate in a mixed event. The CFF Competition Rules allow for up to 5 individuals of the opposite gender to the competition to be mixed in \u0096 the event will still be ranked as a single event. Your points will show up for that weapon and age group.\r\n\r\n---------- EQUIPMENT: ----------\r\n\r\nAll entrants must wear proper protective equipment (fencing jacket, sous plastron, breeches, mask and glove) during competition.

Your CFF\/BCFA membership must be in good standing in order to participate in the tournament. Memberships cannot be purchased at the tournament \u0096 please purchase your passport ahead of time or we may not be able to validate it on the day of the tournament.

We will have the right to refuse you if you do not have a validated CFF licence prior to the tournament.

Waiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament; however, you are welcome to complete the form ahead of time and hand that in at the time of registration.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nVETERAN MIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94090,"tournament_id":23363,"tournament":"FAP  Cadet\/Adult Novice  NON-ELECTRIC Foil ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-03-22T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":25685,"name":"2014 OFC Madness Foil Tournament","start_date":"2014-03-22","end_date":"","comments":"Come fence in our MADNESS Foil tournament with a Mixed Open and D&Under, Y14, Y12 events!","prereg_open":"2014-02-19","prereg_close":"2014-03-21","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Come fence in our MADNESS Foil tournament with a Mixed Open and D&Under, Y14, Y12 events!\r\n\r\n Events Scheduled:\r\n Mixed Foil - 9:00AM\r\n Y12 Mixed Foil - 11:00AM\r\n D&UNDER Mixed Foil - 12:00PM\r\n Y14 Mixed Foil - 2:00PM\r\n\r\n\r\n USA fencing membership required.

If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.
