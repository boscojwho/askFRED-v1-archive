Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519  Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9585322,"longitude":-75.1930377,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108103,"tournament_id":27323,"tournament":"FAP Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-09-28T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":26829,"name":"Cobra Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) (Region 3)","start_date":"2014-09-28","end_date":"","comments":"Note time changes for Y10 M\/W Saber, Y10 M\/W Foil, and Y14 M\/W Saber...

RYC serve as a qualifying path for Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. The top 50% (Y12) and 25% (Y14) on each Regions RRPS will earn qualification to their respective event at that seasons Summer National Championships. <i>(Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at SNs will be National Championships. The Y10 path to qualification remains participation in an RYC or SYC = qualification. Y12 has been adjusted from participation to a top 50% qualification standard. Y14 has been adjusted from the winner of an RYC earns qualification to the top 25% on the RRPS. NRPS earned at SYC or NAC tournaments remain a qualifying path as does the Y14 Divisional qualifier. The qualifying standards for the Youth NAC have NOT changed)<\/i>\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS.  There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships.  All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement.  Given the current number and concentration of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, it was determined that up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, their best 3 results will count.  At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. For more details on this initiative, visit http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/3283\/2014-2015_Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative.pdf\r\n\r\nForeign fencers can compete at any RYC. If they compete out of Region they will not appear on that Region\u0092s Point List nor will points from an outside region transfer to an athletes point total in their home region. Railstation will sort them out. However, their participation will be counted in the overall entrants and be included when the points are calculated for the fencers who competed in their home region. A fencer can ONLY win the Regional Patch Award for the Region they reside in. \r\n\r\nQualification: \r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10\/12\/14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\n<i>Youth NAC:<\/i> Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete.

Extra money will be used to fund fencing gift cards that will be awarded to winners of the individual events!\r\n\r\n<b>How the Championships work:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThere will be 6 events throughout the year (approximately one every even month). Based on how many people are at each event, and how well you place, you will earn points that last the whole season. There are several points categories: Y10, Y12, Y14, 16&Under, 19&Under, Open, and Veteran. Each of these categories will have both a men's and women's champion. If you have the highest number of points in your category at the end of the season, you will be the club champion and your name will go on the wall! We are also adding two new rules this year.

Fencers must check-in each day that they compete, within the indicated hours of check-in, or they will be withdrawn from that event.\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO COMPETE, FENCERS MUST CHECK-IN AT THE COMPETITION FLOOR OF THE VENUE BEFORE THE LISTED DEADLINE WITH THE FOLLOWING IN HAND:\r\n\r\n1. the fencer is required to show a USA Fencing membership card (valid for the current competitive season); AND\r\n2. the fencer is required to provide a fully-completed waiver form that has been signed by a parent or legal guardian; AND\r\n3. the fencer is required to show a birth-certificate (copy acceptable) or other government-issued identification showing a birth date.\r\n\r\nTo help us speed registration, please download the waiver form, print it, read it, sign it, and bring it to the table with you. This is especially critical if the fencer does not have a parent\/guardian at check-in. No one will be allowed to fence without a signed waiver form.\r\n\r\nNew USA Fencing memberships and new or replacement USA Fencing cards should be obtained through the USA Fencing website before the tournament. \r\n\r\nAthletes arriving without proof of USA Fencing membership must fill out all appropriate forms and pay for membership at registration even if already a member. Refund requests can later be made with USA Fencing as appropriate. \r\n\r\nFencers who fail to register by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be made.\r\n\r\nNote that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: Underarm plastron, 2nd weapon and body cord, weapon check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nWeapons with grips other than French will not be inspected or marked in advance. Regardless, failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 7 \u0096 8 am on Friday and Saturday. Please plan accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\n\r\nSeeding:  Seeding shall be based on the following (in order):\r\n1.

Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nFencers from the same club will be separated as much as possible in the first round of competition.  \r\n\r\nAtlanta Fencing Classic will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing.

Arrive early to get your equipment checked! We will be running on a strict schedule so your promptness is appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Registration Information ---\r\nRegistration is $25 plus $25 per event entered and must be pre-paid.\r\n\r\nThe registration & payment deadline is 11:59pm PDT on MONDAY, September 29th.  If you miss the deadline, you will be subject to DOUBLE fees.  Entry fees collected at the door will be subject to TRIPLE fees. \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register & pay online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=26987\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Registration Q & A ---\r\nQ: I missed the registration deadline, can I still attend?\r\nA: Yes, you can still sign up on AskFRED at double fees.  If you pay at the door, the fees will be triple.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I pre-register and pay later?\r\nA: Sort-of.  Pre-register on AskFRED like you normally would, but skip the payment screen.  This will add you to the list of registrants, but note that you have not yet paid.  You can pay later (before the deadline) by simply going through the registration process on AskFRED again.\r\n\r\nQ: I don't want to pre-pay until I'm certain I can attend.\r\nA: If you pre-pay and are unable to attend, we will give you a refund of your event fees.

Using a conductive bib can ground out your opponent's weapon.  It's the same reason why you can't use a saber mask in epee.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Venue Information ---\r\nThe event will be held at:\r\n\r\nThe NEW Salle Auriol Seattle\r\n1419-C Elliot Avenue West\r\nSeattle, WA 98119\r\n\r\nFor directions, visit http:\/\/www.salleauriol.com\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Tournament Rules ---\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA.

No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\nFor foil events, masks must have the conductive bib.

All USFA Foil Events require mask with conductive bibs and mask cords.\r\n\r\nYouth Development Practice Tournaments: DESF will begin a new format for practice tournaments for youth. This format is designed to assist youth to have a fuller learning experience at fencing tournaments and to address youth events that have had historically low turnouts in our area. The format involves fencers as volunteer mentors to assist in creating bouting opportunities for youth with the goal of developing a stronger local field of youth fencers. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nDESF Practice Tournaments: Novice and Adult Practic Events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability. These events are sponsored by DESF as practice tournaments for new fencers and are not Northeast Division sanctioned USFA events. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461.\r\n\r\nThe Mixed Foil - Wheelchair is a debut event due to the presence of a guest para-olympian in our area fencing with our club. Since we have not yet obtained official wheelchair equipment yet, we have modified this event for any fencers to participate in this practice wheelchair simulated format. More information will be given at the tournament. We invite any fencers who would like to participate to sign-up. \r\n\r\nPre-registration & Entry Fees:\r\nUSFA sanctioned events:\r\nEntry fees: $20 per event at the door. $15 per event if you pre-register on Ask-FRED by Friday, 10\/3\/14. These fees only apply to DESF hosted tournaments. Pre-registration closes Friday, 10\/3\/14 at 9:00 PM.\r\n\r\nYouth Development, Novice and practice events: $10 per event per person. If you are a designated volunteer mentor for the youth development events, it is free to participate.\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to volunteer.\r\n\r\nCourtesy of pre-registration is highly encouraged, but those wishing to register at the door are welcome. All volunteer donations to the referee fund are welcome and highly appreciated to help pay or discount the entry fees of those who volunteer to referee. When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nAs tradition, fun and interesting lobster related prizes will be given. Medals for the top three finishers will be given for each event.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Phila.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108108,"tournament_id":27327,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Y14 Foil ","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-05T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27595,"name":"Top Fencing Club Women's Foil Y10 &Y12","start_date":"2014-10-05","end_date":"","comments":"Top Fencing Club is proud to host its first young     tournament.Facilities fully air-conditioned.Medals will be awarded to the top 8\r\n$40 for paid for preregistration\r\n$50 for walk-ins & non-paid registration\r\n\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2014-08-30","prereg_close":"2014-10-03","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Top Fencing Club is proud to host its first youngtournement.facilities fully air-conditioned.Medals will be awarded to the top 8.\r\n\r\n$40 for paid preregistration\r\n$50 for walk-in & non-paid registration\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n Y-10 Women `s Foil: 9:00 AM\r\nY-12 Women`s Foil :11:00 AM\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/30\/2014\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/03\/2014\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event.
