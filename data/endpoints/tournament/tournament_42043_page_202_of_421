He is an outstanding left handed fencer and was a member of the undefeated Seton Hall University team, several times state champion in individual and in team events. He coached Essex Catholic High School for 14 years. During his time, his fencers won nine team state championships, 8 Cetrullo Tournament Championships and 2 greater New York Championships. Dr. D\u0092Ambola is an inducted member of the National Fencing Hall of Fame, Seton Hall University Hall of Fame, Newark Athletic Hall of Fame, Essex Catholic High School Hall of Fame and was inducted into the NJSIAA hall of fame last year.\r\n\r\n<b><i>EVENT<\/b><i>\r\nThe Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) is sanctioned by USA Fencing and their Youth Development Committee (YDC). RYCs are a group of events in each region throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y10, Y12, and Y14 age categories in all six weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn regional points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families. This RYC will provide an opportunity to earn regional youth points. RYC\u0092s are one of the possible qualification paths for Y10 and Y12 fencers to both the March and July NACs.  Y10 and Y12 fencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the March and July NACs.  Y14 fencers placing FIRST in a current season RYC qualify for the Y14 Summer Nationals.  Since only the winner of Y14 events qualify for Y14 at Summer Nationals, these events will not be mixed.  RYC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE license.\r\n\r\nRegional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be used for RYC events. Awards will be given at the end of the season to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region. Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS. Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List. Each participant gets Region 3 points at this RYC. The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. RYC tournaments will award points to all participants. See the regional guidelines for point allocations at (http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6318\/Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative__1_.pdf). Allocations depend on the number of participants. The larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement.  At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS. \r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE OF EVENTS (PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL TIMES POSTED REPRESENT THE CLOSE OF CHECK-IN)<\/b> \r\nFencing will normally commence 20 to 30 minutes after the close of check-in. Start times are subject to change - check askfred.net for updates. It is recommended that fencers arrive at least 1 hour prior to close of check-in time. This should provide them with ample time to register and have their equipment checked and properly warm-up.

We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament. Guides are a courtesy of fencing.net and USFA.\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide (courtesy of fencing.net) http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html \r\n\r\nParents Guide to Fencing (courtesy of Fencing.net) http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html \r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook  http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\nUSFA rules apply: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/7748\/USA_Fencing_Rules_-_January_2013.pdf\r\n\r\n\u0095Fencers are required to register (check-in) prior to the close of registration of their event that day.\r\n\u0095Events will be mixed if there are less than 6 fencers of either gender.\r\n\u0095Events that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\u0095One round of pools with 100% promotion to the Direct Elimination rounds. \r\n\u0095There will be No fence-off for third place.\r\n\u0095Fencers are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of all posted information and must report errors \/discrepancies to the bout committee immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, and the spelling of your name. This information comes directly from AskFred.  Fencers should make sure that their FRED profiles are accurate.\r\n\u0095Fencers should verify all scores prior to leaving the strip. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once the DE round starts and the tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be allowed. The fencer\u0092s signature on the pool sheet or DE slip implies accuracy and acceptance. \r\n\u0095Fencers who wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\n<b>Seeding:<\/b> \r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating and points standing are correct with the USFA, and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx and national point standing at http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Athlete-Info.aspx\r\n\u0095Seeding is based initially on the fencers Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, their letter ranking with the year of classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. \r\n\r\nEach event consists of two rounds (pools and direct elimination)\r\n\u0095Pools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round.\r\n\u0095Direct Elimination Tableau shall be generated from the results of the preliminary pool round.\r\n\r\n\u0095<b>Effective August 1 the Y 10 & Y 12 DE<\/b>\r\nformat has changed Y 10 will be for 10 touches or will end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 touches are scored, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\u0095Y 12 & Y14 DE format - direct elimination bouts will be for 15 touches or will end when 3 periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period have passed. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\u0095The rules for handling ties in score at the end of regulation, awarding of cards and non-combativity will apply as currently written. There will be no exceptions made in Y10 or Y12 DE bouts.\r\n\u0095Medals will be awarded to the top 8 Fencers in all Y-8 events and to the top 3 Fencers in the Y-10, Y12, & Y 14 events. There are no fence-offs for third place.\r\n\u0095Classifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events do not use the E1 or D1 classifications. This means that these events are not rated until they achieve the C1 level or higher. See the USFA ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\n\u0095Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\n<b>Withdrawal:<\/b>\r\n\u0095Withdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws or who is excluded is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not competed.\r\n\u0095Withdrawal during DE: When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout his opponent will be declared the winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>LOCATION<\/b>\r\n50-58 Burnett Avenue, Maplewood, NJ (use 54 Burnett Avenue for MapQuest).

This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94080,"tournament_id":23353,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":15,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-01-12T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24130,"name":"Liberty FC Sabre - Open, Youth, & Team & PhillyCup","start_date":"2014-01-12","end_date":"","comments":"PHILADELPHIA CUP POINT EVENT OPEN TO ALL DIVISIONS.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: Y8 and Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touches, 2 periods of 3 minutes each. The first period ends when 3 minutes have elapsed or one fencer scores 5 touches, whichever comes first.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94081,"tournament_id":23354,"tournament":"FAP Y14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-01-19T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24146,"name":"LFA Sabre Veterans","start_date":"2014-01-19","end_date":"","comments":"USFA sanctioned event. $40 entry fee at the door.","prereg_open":"2013-09-19","prereg_close":"2014-01-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Lilov Fencing Academy","address":"9 Sand Park Rd","city":"Cedar Grove","state":"NJ","zip":"07009","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.866849,"longitude":-74.226929,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":96919,"tournament_id":24146,"tournament":"LFA Sabre Veterans","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Saber","short_name":"VCmMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":22,"prereg_count":28,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-01-19T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":25189,"name":"Snowball Youth Tournament","start_date":"2014-01-19","end_date":"","comments":"Please join us for some fencing fun!

Separate awards for boys' and girls' placements may be given.\r\nCadet and Junior events will require foil masks with bibs and head-wires.\r\nWe will be testing weapons in Cadet and Junior events.\r\nCadet and Junior events will be CFF sanctioned, so CFF memberships will be required.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron or chest protector, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@freestylefencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All Saints Elementary School Gymnasium","address":"1405 Como Lave
