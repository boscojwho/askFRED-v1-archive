If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nMIXED FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Occasionally, tournament organizers will add a second aspect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a clinic the day before or  a Senior Open MS or allowing women to also participate in the MS event (ie, make the MS event a Mixed Saber).  Competitors regularly attend from the East Coast and visitors from farther away are always welcome (and can occasionally find a Vet fencer to host those who need a place to stay).  \r\n\r\nIn addition to awards for each individual tournament, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2018-2019 Cup Point Standings at the end of the season will receive awards.  \r\n\r\n2018-2019 Season Cup Points for each fencer will be calculated as follows: \r\n\r\n1. The sum of that fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4 best results across all 2018-2019 Cup events (if they compete in 4 or fewer events, all of the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s results will count). \r\n\r\n2. Points awarded to fencers at each event will depend on their finish and the number and letter rating of other participants in the event as follows:\r\na. Each participating fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (U=2, E=3, D=4, C=5, B=6, A=7) \r\nb. Each fencer will earns the number of points equal to the total value of all the fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points.\r\nc. In the case of Vet Mixed Events, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) that finish below them.\r\n\r\n2018-2019 Tri-State Veteran Saber Cup Events (as of August 3):\r\n\r\nSeptember 30 - Lilov Fencing Academy (Cedar Grove, NJ)\r\n\r\nNovember 1H \/ October 2H - Location TBC\r\n\r\nJanuary 1 - Tim Morehouse Fencing Center (Port Chester, NY) - AskFred details to come\r\n\r\nJanuary 27 - Manhattan Fencing Center (Manhattan, NY) - AskFred details to come\r\n\r\nMarch 10 - Sheridan Fencing Center (Manhattan or Westchester, NY - AskFred details to come\r\n\r\nJune 16 - Infinity Fencing Alliance (Woolwich Township, NJ) - AskFred details to come\r\n\r\n$45 Early registration on askfred before 9\/27\/18, $60 after 9\/27 and at the door.

levels. Please check the events calendar for more tournament dates.\r\n\r\nRJCC tournaments are open to current USA Fencing competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving the results, the National Office will send an online survey to all participants requesting their feedback.<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>How to earn Regional Points<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul>Please refer to Chapter 3 of the Athlete Handbook for more details on points. \r\n\r\nThe Regional Junior\/Cadet Circuit (RJCC) is designed to promote and develop strong regional tournaments for Junior and Cadet aged fencers who seek competitive opportunities beyond the local and divisional level but below the NAC Junior\/Cadet levels.\r\n\r\nFencers only earn points at RJCCs within their home region (your Region is assigned based on Division affiliation). Only the best 2 results count towards the point total. These points may qualify Cadet and Junior fencers to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and July Challenge. Points earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of national point standings; they are only reflected in regional point standings. \r\n\r\nUsing the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants:\r\n\r\n((# entries - place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points\r\n\r\nThe winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of region. Regional RJCC Points are only earned in the fencer's own region.\r\n\r\nRJCCs must have at least 2 competitors and cannot be fenced with mixed gender.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to JO's from the Junior RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 110 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to JO's from the Cadet RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 110 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li>\r\n<li>Earn 110 Cadet Regional Points composed by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Notes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Points earned from January 11, 2018 - January 10, 2019 will count toward qualification<\/li>\r\n<li>Regional Points are composed of a fencer's top 2 point finishes within the fencer's region<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to the July Challenge from the Junior RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 65 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to the July Challenge from the Cadet RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 65 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li>\r\n<li>Earn 65 Cadet Regional Points composed by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Notes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Points earned from August 2018 - May 2019 will count toward qualification (as long as the fencer is still age eligible)<\/li>\r\n<li>Regional Points are composed of a fencer's top 2 point finishes within the fencer's region<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>For more information about the RJCC:<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjcc-resources<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Registration & Fees<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Registration is through USFencing.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>The Open Period Price ends at 11:59pm on 9\/15\/18.<\/li> \r\n<ul><b>Open Period Admin Fee: $5\r\nOpen Period Registration Fee: $14\r\nOpen Period Sanction Fee: $6\r\nOpen Period Event Fee: $30<\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<li>The Late Period Price begins on 9\/16\/18 and ends at 11:59pm on 10\/2\/18. <\/li>\r\n<ul><b>Late Period Admin Fee: $15\r\nLate Period Registration Fee: $42\r\nLate Period Sanction Fee: $6\r\nLate Period Event Fee: $90<\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Registrations will not be accepted after 11:59pm on 10\/2\/18. <b>NO EXCEPTIONS.<\/b> All registrations must be completed on the USFencing platform.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Seeding<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul>The Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We expect to have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nMIXED DIV II FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n \r\nCheck USA rating at:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nFencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nOther snacks & beverages will be available for purchase.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
