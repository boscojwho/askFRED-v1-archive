A substitute will not affect the initial team value.  For example, a team composed of AAB fencers will have a team value of 2; a team of CDU fencers will have a value of 18; therefore the CDU team will start the match with 16 points from 45, hence a target cumulative score of 29 to win the match.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Medford Elks Lodge","address":"202 N.
