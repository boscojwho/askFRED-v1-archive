Held at the Northwest Fencing Center, this charitable tournament raises funds for the Une Touche foundation, which annually sponsors Oregon fencers in need.  \r\n\r\nThis year, the Columbia International is part of the Regional Open Circuit (ROC). The top 10% of finishers (with a minimum of 4) in the senior events will qualify for Division I-A at Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that compete in the senior events will automatically qualify for the corresponding veteran event at Summer Nationals. Competing in the veteran events on Friday evening WILL NOT qualify you for Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\n---------- Schedule ----------\r\n\r\nFriday, November 5, 2010:\r\n7:00 pm - Veteran Mixed Foil, Epee, and Saber\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 6, 2010:\r\n7:00 am - Doors open\r\n8:00 am - Senior Women's Foil & Senior Men's Saber\r\n1:00 pm - Senior Men's Epee\r\n\r\nSunday, November 7, 2010:\r\n7:00 am - Doors open\r\n8:00 am - Senior Men's Foil\r\n11:30 am - Senior Women's Epee\r\n12:30 pm - Senior Women's Saber\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration. Arrive early to get your equipment checked! We will be running on a strict schedule so your promptness is appreciated.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nAll events will be fenced as a single round of pools, followed by straight direct-elimination, no fence-off for third. If an event exceeds 80 fencers, it may be necessary to do a cut after the pool round. This will be announced after the registration deadline, once the number of attendees is known. \r\n\r\nPrizes will be awarded to the top 8 finishers in the senior events, and top 4 in the veteran events.\r\n\r\n---------- Registration Information ----------\r\n\r\nBefore November 1, 2010:\r\n- $25 registration fee\r\n- $25 per senior event\r\n- $10 per veteran event\r\n\r\nAfter November 1, 2010 (at 11:59pm PST):\r\n- $50 registration fee\r\n- $50 per senior event\r\n- $20 per veteran event\r\n\r\nAll tournament fees must be pre-paid on AskFRED (*see note below). Fencers that have not registered AND pre-paid by the day of their event will be subject to an additional $25 late registration fee at the door.\r\n\r\nEvent fees are fully-refundable - contact darius@nwfencing.org. Registration fees are non-refundable.\r\n\r\n* - Note: If you do not wish to pre-pay online, contact darius@nwfencing.org for alternate payment options. NWFC will accept cash\/check\/credit cards.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Epee\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/22\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":55466,"tournament_id":13097,"tournament":"Div. 3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13102,"name":"November Open","start_date":"2010-11-07","end_date":"2010-11-07","comments":"Hoping to see y'all here--$20 for first event, $10 for second.

IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB.\r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park. On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $6.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.\r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map.\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc@gmail.com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":56025,"tournament_id":13227,"tournament":"Remembrance Day Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":56027,"tournament_id":13227,"tournament":"Remembrance Day Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":56028,"tournament_id":13227,"tournament":"Remembrance Day Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T12:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13231,"name":"Beginner's Foil","start_date":"2010-11-07","end_date":"","comments":"Beginner's foil requires less than one year fencing and will be non-electric (DRY).

USFA rules require each fencer to have a second body cord and a second weapon by the strip; sometimes these may be shared amongst teammates\/friends, however the spare equipment should be at the strip during your bouts. \r\n* Blade length for Y10 fencers must be stamped '0' (30 inches long) or '2' (32 inches).","venue":{"name":"Minnesota Sword Club","address":"4744 Chicago Avenue S.","city":"Minneapolis","state":"MN","zip":"55407","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":44.9165569,"longitude":-93.2627998,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":35,"name":"Minnesota","abbrev":"MN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":54169,"tournament_id":12756,"tournament":"Athos Youth Tournament 2010","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T14:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54171,"tournament_id":12756,"tournament":"Athos Youth Tournament 2010","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54172,"tournament_id":12756,"tournament":"Athos Youth Tournament 2010","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T11:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54173,"tournament_id":12756,"tournament":"Athos Youth Tournament 2010","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54174,"tournament_id":12756,"tournament":"Athos Youth Tournament 2010","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T13:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13268,"name":"East Bay Fencer's Fancy Sword Fest","start_date":"2010-11-07","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-10-12","prereg_close":"2010-11-05","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Please join us for a Fancy Senior Mixed Epee Open to celebrate our fancy new expansion (7 electric strips and thousands of square feet of dedicated fencing space!).\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $30\r\n\r\n1st and 2nd place will receive beautiful swords as prizes! 3rd place will receive a gift certificate for fencing gear.\r\nBest placement by a C & Under fencer, as well as top female finisher will receive a bottle of Veuve Cliquot (if the fencer is under 21, these prizes will go to their appreciated and supportive parents). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/12\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/05\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"East Bay Fencer's Gym","address":"1429 Martin Luther King Jr. Way","city":"Oakland","state":"CA","zip":"94612","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":6,"name":"Northern California","abbrev":"NORCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":56188,"tournament_id":13268,"tournament":"East Bay Fencer's Fancy Sword Fest","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":38,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-07T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13301,"name":"SON Duel LIfe Fencing Masters Qualifier","start_date":"2010-11-07","end_date":"","comments":"Sabre Outreach Network's Duel Life Olympic Fencing Center is proud to announce that they are hosting the Florida Qualifier for the NY Fencing Masters Event.

The events will alternate between foil and epee.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments are designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer. There are four tournaments per weapon. There will be a point system for Epee and Foil. Awards will be given to the top three fencers in the points standings at the last tournaments (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). The points system is described below.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events.

The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments. Awards will be given out at the last tournament of each weapon (Senior Circuit #7 & #8).
