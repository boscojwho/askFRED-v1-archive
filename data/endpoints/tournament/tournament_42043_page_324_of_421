If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall (267) 482-9597 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":156833,"tournament_id":39373,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Epee","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-06-03T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":156834,"tournament_id":39373,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-06-03T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":156835,"tournament_id":39373,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Epee","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Epee","short_name":"CdMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-06-03T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":39658,"name":"HoF's Iron Knight","start_date":"2018-06-03","end_date":"","comments":"We hope this years Iron Knight will be the biggest yet.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 6\/6\/18.
