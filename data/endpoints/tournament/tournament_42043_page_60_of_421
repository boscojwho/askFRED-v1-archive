There is a SAT and Subjects testing date on NOVEMBER 1ST and JANUARY 24TH.  If you believe you will have to qualify through this tournament for Junior Olympics, please plan your test dates accordingly.  The USFA will not give a waiver for missing the qualifying event for this.\r\n\r\nThis qualifier is open only to North Texas Division USFA members.  You must be a citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. to compete. Official proof of current USFA and North Texas Division membership is required - NO EXCEPTIONS. Fencers must show USFA Membership card or an e-mail or FAX from USFA showing confirmation of current membership in this Division or a new membership form and payment will be required (membership forms for minors require the signature of a parent or legal guardian, the coach may not sign). Receipts from clubs or other tournaments are not acceptable as these membership forms may not have been submitted. Membership forms will be available at the venue. Payment for memberships may be by check or credit card only and is made directly to the USFA (bring separate checks for the tournament and membership).\r\n\r\nAll participants must have a WAIVER OF LIABILITY and CONSENT FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT FORM properly signed by a parent or guardian.\r\n\r\nParticipants are required to fence in proper fencing attire; current USFA rules will apply. \r\n\r\n<b>Junior birth years are 1989-1995\r\nCadet birth years are 1992-1995<\/b>\r\nFencers who do not meet the birth year requirement but are on the National Rolling Points List for the next lower age group may compete.

Fencers who qualify for JUNIOR become automatic qualifiers for CADET if they meet the birth year requirements. If there are only three entries, the event will not be fenced as all three entries will qualify; however, you must be at the venue and pay for the event.  JO's will be held February 13-16, 2009, in Albuquerque, NM.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE BY EVENT<\/b>\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 1:00 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Foil  | Sun 12\/07 | 12:30 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Saber  | Sun 12\/07 | 1:00 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 2:00 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Foil  | Sun 12\/07 | 12:00 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Saber  | Sun 12\/07 | 10:30 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 10:30 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Foil  | Sat 12\/06 | 11:00 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Saber  | Sat 12\/06 | 3:00 PM\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 9:30 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Foil  | Sun 12\/07 | 9:30 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Saber  | Sat 12\/06 | 12:00 PM\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE BY DAY AND TIME<\/b>\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 9:30 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 10:30 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Foil  | Sat 12\/06 | 11:00 AM\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Saber  | Sat 12\/06 | 12:00 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 1:00 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Epee  | Sat 12\/06 | 2:00 PM\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Saber  | Sat 12\/06 | 3:00 PM\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Foil  | Sun 12\/07 | 9:30 AM\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Saber  | Sun 12\/07 | 10:30 AM\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Foil  | Sun 12\/07 | 12:00 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Foil  | Sun 12\/07 | 12:30 PM\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Saber  | Sun 12\/07 | 1:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=7023\r\nPreregistation closes on 11\/30\/2008\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
