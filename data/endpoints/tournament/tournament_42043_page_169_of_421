Barb started fencing at Morris Hills High School (NJ) and continued as a college club fencer at Purdue University. She served as the NJ division chair for over 10 years, coached Morris Hills High school for 21 years, served as USFA bout committee chair for many, many national fencing tournaments and Junior Olympic Championships, served as USFA Vice President from 2000-2004, and was honored with a lifetime membership to the USFA. This RYC honors her work on behalf of young fencers.\r\n<b>==================================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\nALL STAFF\/ REFEREES ARE VOLUNTEERS, SO PLEASE HELP OUT. E-mail the organizer. \r\n\r\nFOC official practical exams are being conducted all day.   Referees must have attended a previous FOC seminar and passed written exam.

There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the April and\/or July NACs. Y14 winners qualify for Y14 at Summer Nationals. \r\n\r\nNEW THIS SEASON -- Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be used for RYC events. End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region. Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS. Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List. The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in. Up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count. \r\n\r\nRYC tournaments will award points to all participants. See the regional guidelines for point allocations (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/RYC-Tournament-Organizer-Resources.aspx). Allocations will depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement. Everyone gets points, so attending an RYC will result in every athlete earning a ranking. Regional Rankings will be posted on askfred.net. These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS. <\/i>\r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nQualification Y10\/Y12 to the April and July NACs\r\n\r\n\u0095Fencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the April and July NACs.\r\n\r\nQualification Path to Nationals for Y14 from RYC\r\n\r\n\u0095Place first in the Y14 event at a current-season RYC tournament [BoD, October 2010] In mixed events, only the first place finisher is recognized as qualified.\r\n\r\n<b>==================================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\n<i>Note, This is now the second (not third) event in the 2012-13 Youth Cup Series, as YC #2 was scheduled to be the SYC (canceled because of Hurricane Sandy).

You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1998-2001\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19697\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/14\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still\r\nparticipating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we\r\nwill show you). US Fencing Association (USFA) competitive membership is not required as these are not\r\nsanctioned events. You will still need at least a non-competitive membership to the USFA. This\r\nevent is not rated and you cannot get a classification change from this event.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE\r\n\r\nThe basic entry fee is $5 per fencer per event. Electric equipment rental is $10 per event. The equipment rental is separate from the membership dues which cover general open fencing.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to\r\narrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you\r\nwill need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through\r\nan electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with a round of pools and 100% promotion to direct eliminations. The\r\nrounds will be self-directed. Because this will be a mixed tournament with combined youth and adult\r\nfencers, direct elimination will determined by the age of the fencers involved. If either fencer is\r\na youth (Y8, Y10, or Y12)--meaning 12 years old or younger--the format will be best 2 out of 3, 5 point\r\nbouts as is standard for all 12 and under events.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.

Looking for the 2014 event? Go here: http:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=25238<\/b>\r\n\r\nCost is $15 registration, plus $10 per event--or pay $40 and enter as many events as you want! Please bring <b>cash or checks ONLY,<\/b> as we do not accept debit\/credit at tournaments.\r\n\r\n<b>Note our new location!<\/b> We are just off of 25th & McGilchrist, near the airport and just five minutes off of I-5 exit 253 (Hwy 22). Come fence on our fully suspended floor with state-of-the-art under-strip illumination. Feed your coffee habit at Bad Girls Coffee, right across the street from us.\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE OF EVENTS<\/b>\r\n(* indicates an event NOT sanctioned by the USFA)\r\n\r\n<i>Friday night:<\/i>\r\n<b>Y10 Mixed Epee (born 2002-05)<\/b> Check-in closes at 6:30 p.m.\r\n<b>Y12 Mixed Epee (born 2000-03)<\/b> Check-in closes at 6:30 p.m.\r\nThe Y10 and Y12 events are the fourth and final events in the Cherry City Youth Epee Challenge series. Fencers who bring a prize for the prize table will receive $3 off their tournament fee. Please note that Y10 requires a #2 or shorter epee.\r\n\r\n<i>Saturday:<\/i>\r\n<b>Mixed AFL One-Touch Epee* (all ages)<\/b> Check-in closes at 9:00 a.m.\r\nCome a little earlier and fence in this always-popular event. It's fast and furious, with no room for error, as every single touch counts! It's great practice for end-of-bout and priority situations. Format will be a complete round-robin, with fence-offs to break ties per AFL rules. Bouts are for one minute, one touch; double-touches are double defeats; time expiring is also a double defeat. \r\n\r\n<b>Mixed Wheelchair (able-bodied, too!) Epee* (all ages)<\/b> Check-in closes at 9:30 a.m.\r\nJoin us for the first-ever local wheelchair fencing competition in Oregon (maybe the PNW)! Because of the small number of 'chair fencers, we are also opening this event to able-bodied fencers, which will make it an unsanctioned event. However, if we get at least six entries from disabled Senior (age 13+) fencers, we will close the event to able-bodied fencers and get the event sanctioned. This event will run all day Saturday, concurrently with other events, so you will need to plan on being here all day. The format will be pools, followed by 15-point direct elimination. If the event is small, we may run two rounds of pools, followed by DEs. Please note that a full uniform is required, including knickers, socks, and shoes. Medal and ribbons will be awarded to the highest-placing disabled fencers.\r\n\r\n<b>Senior Mixed Epee (born 1999 or earlier)<\/b> Check-in closes at 11:00 a.m.\r\nThis event will use a unique format using a preliminary seeding round followed by direct elimination with all places fenced. Here are the details. All fencers with the exact same rating will fence each other in a preliminary pool to establish seeding. For example, all of the Unrateds will fence each other; if we have two C2012s, they will fence each other; if we have a D2010 and a D2012, they will not fence a preliminary pool (and the D12 will be seeded ahead of the D10). Fencers with Division 1 points will be entitled to a protected draw per USFA rules. In the event that a male and female fencer with the same rating, ranking, and points are entered, they will fence off. The results of the preliminary round will be used to seed the direct elimination table (all places fenced).\r\n\r\n<b>U20 & Below Mixed Epee (born 1993-99)<\/b> Check-in closes at 2:00 p.m.\r\nWe anticipate that we will have a few NCAA fencers home for the holidays, so we expect this to be a strong event. Junior competitions are hard to find in the Pacific Northwest, so come join us for some practice before the January NAC and Junior Olympics!\r\n\r\n<b>Veteran Combined Mixed Epee (born 10\/2\/72 or earlier)<\/b>  Check-in closes at 2:30 p.m.\r\nOldsters, unite! If you're over 40, join us for a fun event with plenty of veteran smack talk. We'll totter over to Santiam Brewing (just four blocks away) afterwards to consume some tasty adult beverages and commiserate with each other. \r\n\r\n<b>NOTES<\/b>\r\nMedals will be awarded for first place; ribbons for second and third place. \r\n\r\nWe will have four grounded strips, which may or may not be used for your event. \r\n\r\nUSFA membership is required for ALL events, and is available at the tournament; USFA non-competitive members may only fence in unsanctioned events. USFA membership, including upgrades to competitive memberships, can be purchased at the tournament. Save time: make sure yours is current, and renew online at https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/default.aspx before you arrive if it is not!\r\n\r\nAmerican Fencing League (AFL) membership is required for one-touch epee, and is available at the tournament for one-time fee of $18 (cash or checks ONLY).\r\n\r\nAll events require USFA\/AFL-compliant mask, glove, knickers, UAP, socks, and jacket (name stenciling NOT required). Please note that while USFA events allow colored uniforms, etc., AFL events require white uniforms (including socks!). Electrical equipment is mandatory for all events, including One-Touch Epee.  AFL rules and requirements can be viewed online at www.americanfencingleague.org. Thanks for your cooperation.\r\n\r\nCan't make it?

Format will depend on turnout. \r\n \r\nA suggested donation of $10 per person will be collected at the door (all funds will go to the CHS Fencing Scholarship Fund).
