There will be foil events for all age groups, plus Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #2\r\nDate(s): 12\/21\/2019\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, December 21st, 2019\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $20 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2019-2020 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale or rental. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2011-2014\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2005-2008\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=44835\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/20\/2019\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":177479,"tournament_id":44835,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177480,"tournament_id":44835,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177481,"tournament_id":44835,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y12 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y12WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177482,"tournament_id":44835,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y12 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y12MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177483,"tournament_id":44835,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177484,"tournament_id":44835,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":45860,"name":"Mt.

If we have time and fencers are willing we can fence a 2nd weapon style per age group.","venue":{"name":"Red Stick School of Fencing","address":"15450 George O'Neal Rd Ste 11","city":"Baton Rouge","state":"LA","zip":"70817","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":30.406548,"longitude":-91.0134947,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":65,"name":"Louisiana","abbrev":"LA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":181139,"tournament_id":45804,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Beginner Epee","short_name":"U-Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":181143,"tournament_id":45804,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Beginner Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2019-12-21T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":45564,"name":"2019 Central Florida Division JO Qualifier (Foil)","start_date":"2019-12-21","end_date":"","comments":"This event is for Central Florida Division fencers that have NOT qualified by other paths!  \r\n\r\n\r\nHosted by the Central Florida Division and Orlando Fencing Academy\r\n\r\nIf you need additional information, please call at 516-776-1738","prereg_open":"2019-11-02","prereg_close":"2019-12-14","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":20,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"This event is for Central Florida Division fencers that have NOT qualified by other paths!

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Competitors earn cumulative points based on a weighted point formula.\r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Prizes\r\n\r\nOur Grand Prizes are brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event and date, along with a guitar strap, stand and wall mount worth several hundred dollars each!  The Overall Series Champion will also have their name and club affiliation engraved on our perpetual silver trophy cup which is on continuous display!\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to top-8 finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.  Separate medals will be awarded to the top 3 female fencers who finish in each event.  Custom Gold, Silver, and Bronze framed records will be awarded to top 3 places in each Open Mixed Event.\r\n\r\nFor more info about our club, visit: www.musiccityfencingclub.com\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Epee \r\nD & Under Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/12\/2019.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/10\/2020.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695067,"longitude":-86.6757848,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":174329,"tournament_id":44083,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":33,"prereg_count":41,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-11T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174330,"tournament_id":44083,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":45,"prereg_count":54,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-11T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174331,"tournament_id":44083,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":30,"prereg_count":37,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-12T16:30:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174332,"tournament_id":44083,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":45,"prereg_count":58,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-12T11:30:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174333,"tournament_id":44083,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":15,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-12T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":44857,"name":"MDFC Senior Epee U","start_date":"2020-01-11","end_date":"","comments":"$20 cash only.
