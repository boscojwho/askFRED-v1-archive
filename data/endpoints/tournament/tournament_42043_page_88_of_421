IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $4.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc [at] gmail [dot] com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.268185,"longitude":-123.249992,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":46725,"tournament_id":9441,"tournament":"Failed Resolutions Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-24T09:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":46726,"tournament_id":9441,"tournament":"Failed Resolutions Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-24T12:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":46727,"tournament_id":9441,"tournament":"Failed Resolutions Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-24T09:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9970,"name":"CFC - Foil 'D'  ","start_date":"2010-01-24","end_date":"","comments":"Foil 'D' Event\r\n\r\n$20 entry fee.

The top 10% of finishers (with a minimum of 4) in the senior events will qualify for Division I-A at Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that compete in the senior events will automatically qualify for the corresponding veteran event at Summer Nationals.  Competing in the veteran events on Friday evening WILL NOT qualify you for Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>---------- Schedule ----------<\/b>\r\n\r\n<i>Friday, January 29, 2010:<\/i>\r\n6:00 pm - Doors open\r\n7:00 pm - Veteran Mixed Foil, Epee, and Saber\r\n\r\n<i>Saturday, January 30, 2010:<\/i>\r\n7:00 am  - Doors open\r\n8:00 am  - Senior Women's Foil & Senior Men's Saber\r\n11:30 am - Senior Men's Epee\r\n\r\n<i>Sunday, January 31, 2010:<\/i>\r\n7:00 am - Doors open\r\n8:00 am - Senior Men's Foil\r\nNoon    - Senior Women's Epee\r\n1:00 pm - Senior Women's Saber \r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.  Arrive early to get your equipment checked! We will be running on a strict schedule so your promptness is appreciated.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nAll events will be fenced as a single round of pools, followed by straight direct-elimination, no fence-off for third.  If an event exceeds (roughly) 90 fencers, it may be necessary to do cut after the pool round.  This will be announced after the registration deadline, once the number of attendees is known. \r\n\r\nPrizes will be awarded to the top 8 finishers in the senior events, and top 4 in the veteran events.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>---------- Registration Information ----------<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration fees will vary depending on when you make your payment:\r\n\r\nBefore January 20, 2010:\r\n- $25 registration fee\r\n- $25 per senior event\r\n- $5 per veteran event\r\n\r\nAfter January 20, 2010 (at 11:59pm PST):\r\n- $50 registration fee\r\n- $50 per senior event\r\n- $10 per veteran event\r\n\r\nAll tournament fees must be pre-paid on AskFRED (*see note below).

You then travel around a mile and you will see the Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) on your left.  Although you can turn in there and follow signs to the Ernst Cultural Center and the parking garage, it can be very confusing.  Instead, I suggest you continue on Little River Turnpike just past the campus and make a left on Wakefield Chapel Drive.  You will see a large parking garage on your left, and you will want to turn in the campus on Center Drive and enter the garage main entrance on your left.\r\n\r\n\tHere is a Google Link that shows the Campus.  Note Center Drive.  The first white building is the parking garage, the next building down Center Drive is the Venue.  \r\nhttp:\/\/tiny.cc\/hIWd0\r\n\r\n\tHere is a map that shows more of the surrounding roads:\r\n\thttp:\/\/tiny.cc\/6NDvk\r\n\r\n2.\tPARKING GARAGE:\r\n\r\n\tParking is free Sunday.  There is a charge Friday and Saturday at $1 per hour up to $6 for one stay. \r\n\r\n3.\tGARAGE TO ERNST CULTURAL CENTER\r\n\r\n\tOnce you are parked, exit the garage to the side farthest from Wakefield Chapel Road and towards the center of campus. You should see the side of the Ernst Cultural Center.  Go down and toward the front of the building facing the surface parking lots and then up the ramps\/stairs to the main entrance.  Entry doors and then check-in will then be right in front of you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll registrations from now through the date of the tournament must be made by emailing or calling Edward Grass at 202 256 2471 or egrass@mac.com\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY14 Mixed Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/29\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41608,"tournament_id":9586,"tournament":"Y14 Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-30T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10616,"name":"Youth Foil","start_date":"2010-01-30","end_date":"2010-01-30","comments":"This is a youth foil event.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes the Friday prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60400,"tournament_id":14006,"tournament":"Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-30T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10686,"name":"PHX $5 Saber Tournament","start_date":"2010-01-30","end_date":"","comments":"$5 entry fee.

Directors are used to this and will not scratch your bouts if you're fencing in the other event; however, fencing in two events is your choice - please be ready to fence a few bouts in a row if need be to keep your events moving.\r\n\r\nAs always, all fencers must bring their USFA card or be prepared to join at the door ($60, bring a credit card # or separate check).\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Center","address":"62 4th Street","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip":"11231","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.676876,"longitude":-73.994113,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41466,"tournament_id":9546,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing Cadet & Junior Foil","full_name":"Cadet Men's Foil","short_name":"CdMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":26,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-31T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"35.00"},{"id":41467,"tournament_id":9546,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing Cadet & Junior Foil","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":25,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-31T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"35.00"},{"id":41468,"tournament_id":9546,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing Cadet & Junior Foil","full_name":"Cadet Women's Foil","short_name":"CdWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-31T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"35.00"},{"id":41469,"tournament_id":9546,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing Cadet & Junior Foil","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-31T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"35.00"}]},{"id":9048,"name":"Allstar Limo Grand Prix #5","start_date":"2010-01-31","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2009-11-30","prereg_close":"2010-01-31","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":50,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nC & Above Senior Mixed Epee\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/31\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/29\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSponsored by AllStar Limousine\r\n\r\n\t\tSite:  Redlands Fencing Center\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tLimited to Senior C and above epee fencers\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tLimit of 28 fencers for each event \u00e2\u0080\u0093 First come, First serve**\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tPre-registration opens 60 days prior to each event\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tPre-registration on AskFred only\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tRegistration is $50\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2\tAll USFA rules apply including age, equipment, format, and membership\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Format:\tOne (1) round pools with 100% up to DEs (see format for Championship).

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.

Awards are based on the fencer's top 3 results.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events.  Tournament cost is 10.00.  15.00 to register at the door.

The first series will be entirely epee.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Senior Circuit #8 and will be based on Senior Circuits #5-8. The second series will be exclusively foil.  Trophies will be awarded to the top 3 points earners in each series, respectively.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1)  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of participants equals the number of points.  So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points.  The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older (1996 or earlier birthdate) are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.  Trophies will be given out at the last tournament of each series.
