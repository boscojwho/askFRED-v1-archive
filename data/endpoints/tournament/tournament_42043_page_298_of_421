afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a stoppage at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events will be sanctioned and require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nY8, Y10 and Y12 events require a minimum of 4 fencers.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events require a minimum of 6 fencers for sanctioning.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of

other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but <b>NO JEANS OR SHORTS<\/b> allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $60 per team. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=36821\r\n\r\nPre-registration closes on June 9th.","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6256793,"longitude":-122.1570636,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":145753,"tournament_id":36821,"tournament":"RCFC Youth Team Tourney","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"Y10MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-06-10T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":145754,"tournament_id":36821,"tournament":"RCFC Youth Team Tourney","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"Y14MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-06-10T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":145755,"tournament_id":36821,"tournament":"RCFC Youth Team Tourney","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"Y12MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-06-11T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":145756,"tournament_id":36821,"tournament":"RCFC Youth Team Tourney","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"Y14MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-06-11T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
