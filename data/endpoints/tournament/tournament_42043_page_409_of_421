In order for fencers to grow as athletes, boundaries and guidelines must be set regarding the expectations of how parents, coaches and spectators will act.\r\n\r\n<b>Marx Fencing Academy Conduct Standards<\/b>\r\n\r\nOur competition will strictly adhere to USA Fencing Codes of Conduct, as well as SafeSport Guidelines including MAAP resources. In addition, our tournament has a specific set of guidelines outlined below. Every individual within our facility is expected to be familiar with, and adhere to these behavior expectations:\r\n\r\n<li>Show encouragement to all fencers.\r\n<li>Keep comments positive.\r\n<li>Respect personal and professional boundaries of fencers, referees and coaches by providing space and keeping safe distances away from the fencing floor.\r\n<li>Allow coaches and team leaders to coach, support and give advice to their fencers.\r\n<li>Volunteer if you want to be more involved: bout committee, food runs, photography or becoming an armorer are just a few ways our community can be supported.\r\n<li>Leave officiating to the officials.\r\n<li>Avoid or ignore drama and unnecessary controversy that is unproductive.\r\n<li>Help make our events a positive experience for us all.\r\n<li>Report disruptions of these agreements to any tournament staff member.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Marx Fencing Academy, visit: https:\/\/www.marxfencingacademy.com\/\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Notes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>You can reach Marx Fencing by email at michael@marxfencingacademy.com.<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>If you would like to register for the epee event at Vivo, visit: https:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=52084","venue":{"name":"Marx Fencing Academy","address":"19 Keefe Road","city":"Acton","state":"MA","zip":"01720","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":42.4729725,"longitude":-71.407069,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":202421,"tournament_id":52042,"tournament":"Jan 28 @ Marx Fencing Foil NE Developmental Series","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":23,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-01-28T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":202422,"tournament_id":52042,"tournament":"Jan 28 @ Marx Fencing Foil NE Developmental Series","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":22,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-01-28T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":204584,"tournament_id":52042,"tournament":"Jan 28 @ Marx Fencing Foil NE Developmental Series","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":204585,"tournament_id":52042,"tournament":"Jan 28 @ Marx Fencing Foil NE Developmental Series","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":52298,"name":"STLFC Mixed Epee","start_date":"2023-01-28","end_date":"","comments":"Come join us for mixed epee! \r\n","prereg_open":"2022-12-02","prereg_close":"2023-01-27","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Come join us for Mixed Epee!\r\n\r\nArmorer on staff - so bring your broken equipment and get them fixed!\r\n\r\n$10.00 Entry Fee\r\n\r\nStreet Parking\r\nBathrooms with Showers\r\nFull Kitchen\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\nPreregistration opens on 12\/02\/2022.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/27\/2023.","venue":{"name":"STL Fencing Club","address":"1712 Olive St","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","zip":"63103","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":38.6311029,"longitude":-90.2050413,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":36,"name":"St. Louis","abbrev":"STL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":203432,"tournament_id":52298,"tournament":"STLFC Mixed Epee","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":16,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-01-28T09:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":52562,"name":"Great Lakes Fencing Individual Championships","start_date":"2023-01-28","end_date":"","comments":"This meet is restricted to GLFC member schools.
