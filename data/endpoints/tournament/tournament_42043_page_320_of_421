The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n  \r\nThe conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\nIn order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\nThe conductive tissue (lam\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/09\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on

These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.

Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event.

Additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals. The top 40% of finishers in D1A and D2\/3 will receive points. Any fencer who accumulates points over the course of the season will qualify. If a fencer qualifies via points for Div1A and is rating eligible, they will also qualify for Div 2\/3.Fencers who qualify for Div 2 and meet classification requirements for Div 3 will also qualify for Div 3.

This event is proudly held in his memory. Jeff Wolfe, a longtime coach at Brentwood High School, fenced at New York University. After graduating he became a teacher at Brentwood High School where he began both a Boys' Team and a Girls' Team. The Girls' Team was the first girls' varsity program on Long Island. During his tenure (1971- 1998) the Girls' Team had 18 undefeated seasons, 19 League Championships and 18 Sectional Championships. The team set a N. Y. State record winning 98 consecutive dual meets. Jeff Wolfe's W-L record at Brentwood was 388-14. Eight of his fencers became collegiate All- Americans. Four represented the United States in international competition. In 1987, he was the first recipient of the NFCAA Regional Coach Of the Year Award. In 1988 he was named to coach the US Cadet Team at the Continental Cadet Championships and the World Cadet Championships. Coach Wolfe was a highly respected member of the fencing community, and is greatly missed by all those who knew him.\r\n\r\nCost Information:\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net.

Slaughter Legacy Tournament \r\n\r\nThis is the Second Annual Chuck Slaughter Legacy Tournament. Two non profit organizations that were important to Chuck were the Amarillo Competitive Fencing Association and The Bridge Children's Advocacy Center. You know about ACFA, but please visit http:\/\/www.bridgecac.org\/ to find out more info about The Bridge. \r\n\r\nChuck Slaughter started his fencing odyssey with his son, Jared, in Coach Howard's adult continuing education classes at Amarillo College. After developing a passion for fencing, Chuck started the youth fencing continuing education class in 2001. In his time as a coach and instructor at Amarillo College and the Amarillo Competitive Fencing Association he taught hundreds of ordinary adults and kids how to be better athletes and better members of society. Chuck expanded his fencing knowledge by earning certification with the United States Fencing Coaches Association and by learning one-on-one with an Olympic coach. The fencers Chuck taught ranged from weekend warriors, NCAA fencers, multiple national finalists, and a national champion. He spent countless hours coaching and teaching fencing three times a week for 15 years. He even traveled with his fencers to tournaments on his own dime all across the country and even to Europe. \r\nIn 2006, he was selected as the United States Fencing Association Volunteer Coach of the Year. In the same year he was also a finalist for the United States Olympic Committee Volunteer Coach of the Year. In 2009, he was awarded a United States Fencing Coach Medal when he coached Juleah Nusz to a national championship. He was even featured on an episode of Texas Country Reporter.\r\nChuck didn't coach for fame or money; he coached because he loved to teach and he loved his fencers. So many current and former AC fencers can trace life lessons back to what they learned from Chuck and the experiences they shared with him. There is no way any of us can replace Chuck or his passion. We each have our own Chuck stories. Early in the youth program, at an RYC in El Paso someone from Dallas asked Chuck what European style he taught. His answer: Amarillo style. His student went on to win the tournament.\r\n\r\nDATE\r\nApril 29, 2018\r\n\r\nVENUE\r\nAmarillo College\r\nCarter Fitness Center & AC Fencing Salle\r\nCorner of 24th Street & Washington\r\nAmarillo, TX 79109\r\n\r\nBOUT COMMITTEE AND FOC\r\nBout Committee Contact Info: bary.nusz@live.com (806) 553-0115\r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED\r\nFencing will commence for each event as soon as possible after close of registration.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 4\/25\/18.
