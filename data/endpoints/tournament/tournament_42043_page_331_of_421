She was captured by pirates at a young age and quickly rose to prominence and authority. After the death of her husband, she took control of the local pirates in the China Sea, creating a host with over 300 ships and 20,000-40,000 pirates! She battled and defeated navies from the British Empire, the Portuguese Empire, the East India Trading Co. and the Qing Dynasty before eventually being granted amnesty by the Chinese emperor and retiring to a life of luxury with all of her pirated riches.\r\n\r\nAs Pirate Queen, she enacted a strict code of laws governing the behavior of her pirates toward towns that helped them, the orderly sharing of any seized loot, and the behavior of her pirates toward any women who were captured.\r\n\r\nBuccaneer Blades Fencing is hosting this women-only tournament to celebrate women in fencing and raise awareness about domestic violence.

For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs. Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated. If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get good with blade-work. Visualize every bout starting with you being backed up to the end of the strip. Try it - you'll like it! Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.   \r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Utah Swords Academy Fencing Club","address":"3536 South West Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","zip":"84115","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":40.6945353,"longitude":-111.8942605,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":12,"name":"Utah-Southern Idaho","abbrev":"UT-SID","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":167689,"tournament_id":42165,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #11","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Any-Age, Walk & Roll Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"Any-Age, Walk & Roll","close_of_reg":"2018-10-29T18:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":167690,"tournament_id":42165,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #11","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-10-27T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":167694,"tournament_id":42165,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #11","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-10-27T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41399,"name":"Fall Steel 2018 - D & Under","start_date":"2018-10-27","end_date":"","comments":"Omaha Fencing Club's Fall Steel D & Under\r\n\r\nD & Under Events:\r\nMixed Foil - 8:30am\r\nMixed Epee - 11:00am\r\nMixed Saber - 1:00pm","prereg_open":"2018-08-26","prereg_close":"2018-10-26","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Tournament Contact: Alex Bucevicius 402-660-7079\r\n\r\nThe Omaha Fencing Club opens the Nebraska fencing season with the third annual Fall Steel!

or later\r\nCadet = birth year 2002 or later\r\nJunior = birth year 1999 or later\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Structure:<\/b>\r\nAll times are close of registration, fencing to commence immediately afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a stoppage at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events will be sanctioned and require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nY8, Y10 and Y12 events require a minimum of 4 fencers.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events require a minimum of 6 fencers for sanctioning.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of fencers of each gender.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, chest protector (must for girls), mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't yet have proper knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers in Y12 and above events will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:\r\nhttp:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow like: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All

Late fees can only be paid in cash or check. Checks are to be made out to Nevada Fencing Division.\r\n\r\nReferee for the event is Bill Gelnaw\r\n\r\nFencers who qualify for junior, if age eligible, are auto qualified for cadet events. If you registered for both junior and cadet, then qualify at the junior event, thereby also qualifying for cadet, but decide on tournament day not to fence the cadet event, you will not receive a refund for the cadet entry fee.\r\n\r\nUSFA Membership - USFA rules will be enforced. All fencers must be current members of the USFA . Proof of USFA membership is either an unexpired membership card, an email from the USFA or listing on the USFA website. Membership forms will be available at the tournament or may be downloaded from the USFA website however USFA is charging $10 extra for paper entry forms. To speed up the process, it will be better to renew membership online at usfencing.org. If proof of membership is unavailable fencers will be required to submit a new membership application form with payment at the door. No exceptions.\r\n\r\nWeapons are checked (weights and shims) during pools and direct eliminations for all events. Fence off for third place is in effect. \r\nJr. events start at 3:00 pm sharp\r\nCadet events start after the Jr. event. approx. 4:30 pm.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there are three (or less) fencers that have paid and are registered to any event, then you will NOT have to fence the event. You will be automatically qualified for that event. There needs to be 4 or more in your event for there to be a fencing event.Being signed up and not paid is not being signed up. You must be paid up by the deadline to be able to be counted as on the list to fence.\r\n\r\nThis is a national qualifier so all USFA rules pertaining to this event are in effect.

Join us for two days of team competition! Open and D & Under foil and epee events.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: 2018 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney\r\nDate(s): 11\/03\/2018 - 11\/04\/2018\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 3rd:\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Open Team Foil, D & Under Team Epee\r\n\r\nSunday, November 4th:\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Open Team Epee, D & Under Team Foil\r\n\r\nAll times listed are close of registration.\r\n\r\nDepending on the number of teams in each event, the event format will either be round robin, or direct elimination with all places fenced out. Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nAll events are for fencers born in 2005 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. D & Under events are for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2018-2019) competitive members of USA Fencing. Please join or renew your membership online at https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/. Foreign fencers must sign up for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We expect to have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $60 per team. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=41428\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/02\/2018\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

All teen fencers of all skill level are welcome.  You do not have to be a hot shot competitor or be interested in competing at Junior Olympics to enjoy this tournament, meet other fencers your age, and gain valuable experience.  You do need to have a competitive US Fencing membership (if you are currently a noncompetitive member, you must upgrade to competitive status before the tournament, by going to www.usfencing.org).\r\n\r\nThere are event for two age groups:\r\nCadet: teens born 2002-05.  These events are only for younger teens\r\nJunior: teens born 1999-2005.  These events are open to both younger and older teens\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to make a day of it, and sign up for at least 2 events, depending on your age and which weapon(s) you fence.  While you may sign up for 4 or more events, that takes a lot of stamina, so unless you are a pretty hardcore athlete, 2-3 events is a good number in one day.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $15 for your first event, plus $5 per additional event.   Note that unlike most GMD events, where the price goes up after the preregistration date, for this tournament, registration actually closes and you will not be able to sign up after October 30.","venue":{"name":"Mary Hogan School","address":"201 Mary Hogan Dr","city":"Middlebury","state":"VT","zip":"05753","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":44.0104265,"longitude":-73.1616145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":82,"name":"Green Mountain","abbrev":"GRMT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":165476,"tournament_id":41584,"tournament":"Teen Fencing Day, aka Jr Olympic Qualifier","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-04T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165477,"tournament_id":41584,"tournament":"Teen Fencing Day, aka Jr Olympic Qualifier","full_name":"Cadet Men's Foil","short_name":"CdMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-04T11:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165479,"tournament_id":41584,"tournament":"Teen Fencing Day, aka Jr Olympic Qualifier","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-04T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165480,"tournament_id":41584,"tournament":"Teen Fencing Day, aka Jr Olympic Qualifier","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-04T11:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165481,"tournament_id":41584,"tournament":"Teen Fencing Day, aka Jr Olympic Qualifier","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-04T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165483,"tournament_id":41584,"tournament":"Teen Fencing Day, aka Jr Olympic Qualifier","full_name":"Junior Men's Saber","short_name":"JrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165484,"tournament_id":41584,"tournament":"Teen Fencing Day, aka Jr Olympic Qualifier","full_name":"Junior Women's Saber","short_name":"JrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41334,"name":"Bay Cup: Y10XE2 Y12XE2 Y14WE2 Y14ME2 JWE2 JME2 WE2","start_date":"2018-11-04","end_date":"","comments":"Bay Cup at Academy of Fencing Masters - Y10XE, Y12XE, Y14ME, Y14WE, JME, JWE, WE","prereg_open":"2018-08-30","prereg_close":"2018-11-01","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Events:\r\nY10 Mixed Epee\r\nY12 Mixed Epee\r\nY14 Women's Epee\r\nY14 Men's Epee\r\nJunior Women's Epee\r\nJunior Men's Epee\r\nSenior Women's Epee\r\n\r\nEvent times are subject to change based on the final number of participants.\r\n\r\nBAY CUP TOURNAMENT REGISTRATION FEE:\r\n\r\n$30 non-member fee per tournament (covers multiple events per day)\r\n\r\nThis is a Bay Cup tournament.
