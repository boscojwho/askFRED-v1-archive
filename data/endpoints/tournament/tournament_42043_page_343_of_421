Any problems, try http:\/\/support.askfred.net\r\nThank-you for playing!\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning Everyone!\r\n\r\nJust wanted to give you a heads-up that there is Spring Fest Fair today in Nyack. There is an easy way to get to the tournament located at the YMCA -35 South Broadway and parking.\r\n\r\nCome down Route 59 entering Nyack and make a right onto 9W, Left on Depew, Right on South Franklin, Left on Cedar Hill, Left on Piermont Ave. The street you'll want to come up is Remsey. Of course there is no sign at the corner, but you will see a green house, a fire hydrant and a street sign that says Apostle Alston Way. Parking is available in the back of the YMCA, adjacent parking lots and the surrounding neighborhoods. \r\nWalk up Remsey to the front entrance of the Y. Hope to see you later today.\r\nGive yourself a little extra time to get to the event. Feel free to call me at 917-371-5603 if delayed.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nMika'il Sankofa","venue":{"name":"THRUST FENCING ACADEMY","address":"35 SOUTH Broadway","city":"NYACK","state":"NY","zip":"10960","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.0897495,"longitude":-73.9183102,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":44,"name":"Westchester-Rockland","abbrev":"WST-RCK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":171381,"tournament_id":43150,"tournament":"Thrust SABRE MIXED Y8,Y10,Y12, U","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-04-07T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":171382,"tournament_id":43150,"tournament":"Thrust SABRE MIXED Y8,Y10,Y12, U","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-04-07T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":171383,"tournament_id":43150,"tournament":"Thrust SABRE MIXED Y8,Y10,Y12, U","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-04-07T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":171384,"tournament_id":43150,"tournament":"Thrust SABRE MIXED Y8,Y10,Y12, U","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y8MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-04-07T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41364,"name":"Bay Cup at HALB: XF4, WF4, VXF4, RXF2","start_date":"2019-04-07","end_date":"","comments":"Bay Cup at HALB","prereg_open":"2018-08-24","prereg_close":"2019-04-06","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"EVENTS:\r\n\r\nDoors Open - 9pm\r\n\r\nVet Mixed Foil - 10am \r\nWomen's Open Foil - 12pm\r\nMixed Open Foil - 2pm\r\nRated Mixed Foil - 4pm\r\n\r\nBAY CUP TOURNAMENT REGISTRATION FEE:\r\n\r\n$30 non-member fee per tournament (covers multiple events per day)\r\n\r\nThis is a Bay Cup tournament.

In this example there are 38 such fencers. 25% of that group\r\nequals 10, the number of fencers who can qualify for Division III Nationals.\r\nStarting with the first fencer after those qualified for Division II (in this example, 13th place); count off the next 10\r\nD, E, or U fencers who have not already qualified by other paths. These 10 D, E, or U fencers are qualified for\r\nDivision III. (Any C fencers in this range are skipped, but not counted against the 10, because they are not eligible\r\nto fence Division III.)\r\n\r\nWe will be selling concession items such as fruit, water, gaterade, and protein bars.

$25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, chest protector (must for girls), mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't yet have proper knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers in Y12 and above events will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:\r\nhttp:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow like: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All Saints Elementary School Gymnasium","address":"1405 Como Lake

How is this so different from a standard competition?  Well, Glad you asked!\r\n\r\nThe Sharks and Minnows format features TWO rounds of pools, witht he 2nd round sorting the winners of the initial round of pools into their own separate pool of \"Sharks\" and the rest of the pools will be seeded from their performance in the first round.  Finally, results from the second round of pools will then be seeded into the DE table, with the \"Sharks\" pool guaranteed top seeds in the table.\r\n\r\nThis allows fencers to compete TWICE as much in a single day, and also allows the higher performing fencers to fence against competitors at their level of performance during the 2nd round, while the less well performing fencers have a better chance of improving their seeding into the DE table.\r\n\r\nFinally, to keep the competition moving, we will be cutting the promotion into the DE table to the table of 16.\r\n\r\nSo, sign up for the Spring Fencing Fest, and get your fill of fencing!\r\n\r\nThe IUP fencing club will be hosting this competition in Gym B of the IUP Zink Hall.  Separate changing rooms for men and women are available to all participants.  Free parking in the back lot, and easy access to food from around the campus.\r\n\r\nThis is a Division II (C and Under) Foil and Epee competition using the USA Fencing sanctioned \"Sharks and Minnows\" format.

Check your current points at: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n \r\nCheck USA rating at:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nFencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We expect to have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2010-2013\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2008-2011\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2004-2007\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=41426\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/19\/2019\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 12:00 PM (NOON) check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Division information at http:\/\/www.njfencing.org.\r\n\r\nEmail debbie@bcaf.com with any questions","venue":{"name":"Bucks County Academy of Fencing","address":"287 South Main Street","city":"Lambertville","state":"NJ","zip":"08530","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.356958,"longitude":-74.9430713,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":168183,"tournament_id":42288,"tournament":"BCAF 14th Annual Easter Egg Epee Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":25,"prereg_count":31,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-04-21T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":43097,"name":"Bergen Fencing Club Youth Saber ","start_date":"2019-04-21","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for the Bergen FC Youth Saber Tournament open for all Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14 saber fencers!
