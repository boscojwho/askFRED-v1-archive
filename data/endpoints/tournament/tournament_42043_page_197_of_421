All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $50.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an \u0093incomplete\u0094 registrant on FRED\u0092s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Tournament Format:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table. Pools for Cadet events will start, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. \r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b><i>Eligibility Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be <b>current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.<\/b> To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\nTo fence in JUNIOR events, fencer birth year must be between 1994-2000.\r\nTo fence in CADET events, fencer birth year must be between 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies <b>prior<\/b> to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event.

As of August 1st, 2012, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the conductive foil bib.\r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords.

It is a chance for the Division's more experienced fencers to share their knowledge with beginners, and for first-time competitors to make new friends.  This year's D-Day will be open to ALL teen (born 1994-2000) and adult (born 1993 or earlier) fencers.   Schedule for the day:\r\n\r\n10 a.m.-12 p.m. Clinic.  Fencing: the Inner Game (the psychology of fencing).  For more info and to sign up, click here:\r\nwww.askfred.net\/Clinics\/moreInfo.php?clinic_id=24530\r\n\r\n12-12:30 lunch break, tournament organization\r\n\r\n12:30 p.m.  Start Poule Unique foil tournaments (one for teens, one for adults)\r\n\r\n2 p.m. Start Poule Unique epee tournaments (one for teens, one for adults)\r\n\r\n5 p.m. (approximately).  Social hour starts at a nearby restaurant!  Everyone is invited.  If the group is large, we may send the adults to a pub and the teens to a pizza parlor.\r\n\r\nAbout the tournaments:\r\nThese are non-USFA events.  The focus is on pulling in first-time competitors.  One CC point for participation, no bonus points, no ratings awarded.\r\n\r\nPoule Unique means everyone in the event fences everyone else a single 5-touch bout.  Advantages of this format:\r\n-No eliminations.  Everyone fences the same number of bouts, win or lose.\r\n-This format works well for an event that includes fencers of a wide variety of skill level, from rated down to brand new.  At worst, a newbie will lose 5-0 to an experienced fencer and still gets to keep fencing (not be crushed 15-0 and then eliminated).  \r\n-This format works well for peer coaching.  Each experienced fencer is assigned one or two newbies as \u0093travel buddies\u0094.  You fence your travel buddies first.  After that, you go together to a strip to fence with another little group of travel buddies (each member of your group fences each member of the other group, recording all scores to a master scoresheet).  This ensures that there will always be an experienced fencer available to ref.  More important for D-Day, the experienced fencers will coach their travel buddies through the tournament.\r\n-It\u0092s a sociable format.  You get to dance with everyone.  We did this last year for the adult event at D-Day and it was a big hit.  \r\n-It\u0092s easier to deal with fencers who fence both weapons (works more smoothly when there are no long DE bouts to wait for the double-dippers to finish).  So go ahead and sign up for both foil and epee if you wish.\r\n-Instead of having a U or Novice event where the experienced fencers do nothing but ref, this is more fun because we get to play too, and the novices get to watch a few good bouts between experienced fencers.  It also includes the in-between fencers who are not really novices, but not experienced enough to ref and coach yet either.  \r\n-Awards for the best first-time competitors and best unrated competitors, as well as overall winners.  \r\n\r\nNote: this year we have scheduled Teen Fencing Day (a.k.a. Jr Olympic Qualifiers) back-to-back with Development Day.  We are hoping many of you newbie teens will choose to participate in both days!  In order to make that possible, especially for those with a long drive, Viveka is offering overnight hospitality at her home for those competing both days who need a place to stay.  Theoretically, your parents could drop you off on Saturday morning and pick you up again on Sunday afternoon, making a weekend mini-camp of it!

events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event.  Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2013-14 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2014, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1994-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1995-2001 and for the cadet events 1998-2001.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"191 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10021","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661365,"longitude":-73.9793266,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":95739,"tournament_id":23811,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Epee","short_name":"CdWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-17T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":95740,"tournament_id":23811,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-17T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":95741,"tournament_id":23811,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-17T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":95742,"tournament_id":23811,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-17T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":24328,"name":"Escrimeur TOUCH\u00c9! 2013 - Foil + Sabre Open","start_date":"2013-11-17","end_date":"","comments":"*** Pending USFA sanctioning approval\r\n\r\nESCRIMEUR Signature Annual Tournament: Foil and Sabre Open.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $50.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made.

Pools for Cadet events will start, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. \r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b><i>Eligibility Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be <b>current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.<\/b> To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\nTo fence in JUNIOR events, fencer birth year must be between 1994-2000.\r\nTo fence in CADET events, fencer birth year must be between 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies <b>prior<\/b> to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event.

As of August 1st, 2012, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the conductive foil bib.\r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\n Q. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\n A. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\n Q. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\n A. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=23473\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/16\/2013\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
