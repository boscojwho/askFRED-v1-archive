The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Current ratings can be verified here: https:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/search\/members  Current points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n\r\n1.\tCurrent national Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC\r\n2.\tLetter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3.\tAthletes with neither of the above are seeded in a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\nIt is the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event (i.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc). \r\n\r\n<b>FORMAT<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll events will have one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau.

He served as the coach and captain for Baylor's fencing club in the early years of its existence, leading teams to win the Southwest Conference Championship from 1939-1941. In 1940, he also won the individual competition for all three weapons. He served in WWII as a technical sergeant in the Army Air Force for four years, before returning to Baylor to complete his law degree. Mr. Adelman graduated Baylor Law School in 1948, after which he went on to complete his law degree at NYU. He practiced for the law firm Beard and Kultgen until his retirement in 1999. Mr. Adelman was a student of Jewish history, philosophy and archeology. His greatest joy was his many trips to Israel to visit his ancestral homeland. On Wednesday June 5, 2002, at age 81, Mr. Adelman died in a nursing home after a long illness. This tournament was set up to honor his legacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdelman Memorial Tournament will be held at Russell Gym on Baylor University campus. \r\n\r\nPayment will be taken in the form of cash or check made out to Baylor University Fencing Club at the door due to university policy.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2006-2009) and Senior (2005 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n5:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it's ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior: can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries x place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates and prize themes for the 2018-2019 events:\r\n#1 August 25, 2018, National Dog Day\r\n#2 October 27, 2018, National Chocolate Day\r\n#3 January 5, 2019, National Science Fiction Day\r\n#4 March 2, 2019, National Frozen Foods Day\r\n#5 May 18, 2019, National Learn to Swim Day\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Dr.","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8461712,"longitude":-97.2377178,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":162956,"tournament_id":41038,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #2","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-10-27T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162957,"tournament_id":41038,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #2","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-10-27T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162958,"tournament_id":41038,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #2","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-10-27T17:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162959,"tournament_id":41038,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #2","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-10-27T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41574,"name":"Granite State Open at CFC","start_date":"2018-10-27","end_date":"","comments":"Pre-registration Deadline:  Thursday PM (midnight) prior to tournament.
