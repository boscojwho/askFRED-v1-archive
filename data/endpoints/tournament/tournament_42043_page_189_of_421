Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing glove must cover half of the forearm. Names on uniforms are not required per SYC guidelines.\r\n<li>Standard fencing plastron; required with every uniform; women must wear chest protector.\r\n<li>Mask: 12K punch test. Sewn-in or channel (Leon Paul X-change style) bib. Conductive Bib in foil is required. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\n<li>The maximum blade length permitted for Y10  competitions is 32.5 inches. This requirement shall be strictly enforced. Y12, Y14 and Cadet competitions, standard blade length of 30-35\u0094 permitted.\r\n<li>Any attachment to a weapon's handle must fix the hand in one position such that the top of the thumb is no more than 2 cm from the inner surface of the guard.\r\n<li><b>Epee wiring must meet the current standards in effect as of August 1, 2013. For more information, please see http:\/\/www.fencingofficials.org\/blog\/2013\/05\/wiring-epees\/<\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>SEEDING<\/b>: Seeding for Youth Events shall be based on the following order:\r\n<ul>1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.<\/ul>\r\nSeeding for Cadet Events will use National Cadet ranking within classification, then classification\/year.\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT FORMAT<\/b>\r\n<i>Please note new Y10 and Y12 DE formats for the 2013-2014 season as designated by the USA Fencing Board of Directors and Youth Development Committee.<\/i>\r\n<ul><li>All events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations.  Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per SYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau.  Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\n<li>No fence off for 3rd place.\r\n<li>For Y10 direct elimination bouts are <b>10 touch bouts<\/b> (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n<li>For Y12, Y14 and Cadet events, DE bouts are <b>15 touch bouts<\/b> (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n<li>SYC's are national point events and serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments, therefore, no events at an SYC may be combined regardless of number of entrants.<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS<\/b>:\r\n<ul><li>SYC Competitions award points to the top 40% of the field regardless of where the cut off occurs, within a pool round of a direct elimination bracket. For example, if there are 17 fencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8. Only the top 6 finishers, not the top 7 finishers, earn points.\r\n<li>Classifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\n<li>Points, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday or Sunday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday or Monday of this tournament.\r\n<li> National points are not earned for Cadet events, nor is this a qualifying event for Cadet.<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>VENUE:<\/b>\r\nLocation: Irving Convention Center\r\n500 West Las Colinas Boulevard \r\nIrving, TX 75039\r\nThe venue has complimentary wi-fi access throughout the building.\r\nFor directions to the venue by DART, train, taxi, or personal vehicle, go to the Irving Convention Center website:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.irvingconventioncenter.com\/facility-information\/\r\n\r\nThere are coupons on their website for taxi and shuttle discounts and a printable parking map with driving directions. \r\n\r\n<b>VENDOR INFORMATION<\/b>\r\nExclusive vendor of fencing equipment and headline sponsor <b>Absolute Fencing Gear<\/b>. \r\n\r\n<b>AIRPORTS:<\/b>\r\n<ul><li>Dallas Fort Worth Airport (DFW), \r\n8 miles from venue.\r\n<li>Dallas Love Field airport (DAL), \r\n9 miles from venue.\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b>Airport Transportation<\/b>\r\nWe recommend using SuperShuttle: http:\/\/www.supershuttle.com\/. \r\n\r\n<b>Host Hotels<\/b>\r\n<i>The Hampton Inn Las Colinas<\/i> - <b>SOLD OUT<\/b>\r\n<ul>820 Walnut Hill Lane\r\nIrving, TX 75038\r\n(972) 753-1232\r\n<b>$72\/night rate is good through 8\/16\/2013.

Once the team event is over, the members of the winning team will then fence each other 5 touches for the medals. This event will have just as much, and perhaps more fencing than a normal open.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/28\/13.
