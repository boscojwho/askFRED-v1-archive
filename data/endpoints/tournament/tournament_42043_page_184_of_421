Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87624,"tournament_id":21420,"tournament":"FAP Div3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-19T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21677,"name":"MTeam OC Sanctioned Youth Foil Match Y14","start_date":"2013-05-19","end_date":"","comments":"The MTeam OC Youth Foil Match is a SANCTIONED event open to all fencers Y14, regardless of rating.

Rain-soaked feet, ill-fitting shoes, constant standing and diseases like diabetes take their toll on the feet of homeless people. Every day, nurses and physicians treat a huge range of foot ailments - from trench foot to skin infections, to nail diseases.  The best way to prevent such conditions is to keep feet clean and dry \u0096 very difficult if you spend your days outside.\r\n\r\nClean, white socks are a staple of homeless health care and make a real difference.  Or if you want to do more, contact Sajan Patel at sajanspatel1@gmail.com and help out!\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"USF Rec Center, North or East Gym","address":"4202 E.

Events with fewer than four fencers registered on AskFred by Wednesday, May 22nd may be canceled at tournament organizer's discretion. We want YOU fencing with us!\r\n\r\nRegistration is $10, and each event is $10. The team event is $30 per TEAM, and fencers ONLY participating in the team event do not need to pay the registration fee. Fees are payable with cash or check at the venue. Sorry, no credit\/debit.\r\n\r\nPlease use the location listed above, and NOT a general Google maps search.  They still have our old address (on Belmont St.) listed, which is incorrect.\r\n\r\n*New!*  You do not need to be an AFL member to participate.  You DO need to be a member of the USFA, but only at the nominal ($5) level for insurance purposes.  You may obtain this membership at the event.  \r\n\r\n<b>Rules for Three-Weapon Team event<\/b>\r\nThree-weapon teams have one fencer for each weapon (three team members total). A three-weapon team match consists of three bouts fenced as a relay (i.e. using a cumulative score), similar to USFA team matches. Prior to each team match, the team captain will determine which fencers will fence which weapons. This choice cannot be changed once it has been submitted to the bout committee. \r\n\r\nThe order of bouts will be randomly determined by rolling a six-sided die BEFORE the fencer weapon choices have been submitted to the bout committee. \r\n\r\n1=Foil, Epee, Sabre\r\n2=Foil, Sabre, Epee\r\n3=Epee, Foil, Sabre\r\n4=Epee, Sabre, Foil\r\n5=Sabre, Foil, Epee\r\n6=Sabre, Epee, Foil\r\n\r\nEach bout will end when three minutes of effective fencing time have passed or when the next increment of five points is reached (i.e. 5 points for the first bout or 10 for the second). The match is over when time expires in the third bout or when one team reaches 15 points, whichever happens first. \r\n\r\nIf epee is the first or second weapon in the match and a double-touch occurs on the last potential point of the bout, a point will be awarded to each team, even if the score is tied. However, if epee is the third weapon in the match and a double-touch occurs on the last potential point of the bout, the double-touch shall be annulled, both fencers will maintain their ground, and then continue fencing. \r\n\r\nIn the event that the score is tied at the end of the third bout in the match, priority will be determined per USFA rules. Non-combativity rules do NOT apply to AFL events, including team events. \r\n\r\nNo substitutions will be allowed during a team match, except in the event of an injury during the final bout (in which case, one of the other two team members may complete the bout). \r\n\r\nFor three-weapon team only, foil and epee bouts will both use a 14-meter strip; sabre bouts will use a virtual 28-meter strip per AFL rules. \r\n\r\n<b>Equipment<\/b>\r\nEquipment requirements are the same as the USFA, with two notable exceptions: 1.) No lam\u00e9s or body cords are required for foil or sabre. The use of electrical weapons is fine. 2.) <b>WHITE SOCKS<\/b> are required (small colored insignia or single stripes are fine). Fencers with colored socks will be allowed to fence, but given a yellow card at the start of each bout.\r\n\r\nQuestions can be directed to info@salemclassicalfencing.org or call 503-375-9209.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salem Classical Fencing","address":"2455 McGilchrist St. SE","city":"Salem","state":"OR","zip":"97302","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":44.9166484,"longitude":-123.0116999,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":91104,"tournament_id":22455,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed AFL Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"AFL","close_of_reg":"2013-05-25T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":91105,"tournament_id":22455,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed AFL Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":9,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"AFL","close_of_reg":"2013-05-25T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":91106,"tournament_id":22455,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed AFL One-Touch Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":16,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"AFL One-Touch","close_of_reg":"2013-05-25T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":91107,"tournament_id":22455,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed AFL 3 Weapon Team Foil","short_name":"MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":true,"description":"AFL 3 Weapon","close_of_reg":"2013-05-25T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22208,"name":"KOS SC Team Deathmatch (just kidding)","start_date":"2013-05-25","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2013-04-04","prereg_close":"2013-05-24","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Knights of Siena -

Rules<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n  - wear a fencing jacket, plastron or chest protector, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n  - wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n  - wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n  - wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n  - use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\nMasks with lame bibs are not required for youth events, but an mandatory for cadet events.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18

Believe it or not, some of the most advanced cancer research in the world is being done in Victoria, and the BC Cancer Foundation, in conjunction with the BC Cancer Agency, are helping make this possible.\r\n\r\nTo date, the Fence-a-Thon has raised nearly $15,000.  Each year exceeds the last year's donation totals.  Every dollar that is contributed in registration fees and donations goes directly to the BC Cancer Foundation - all the costs associated with running the event are donated by community members and local businesses.\r\n\r\nDonations over $20 are eligible for tax receipts.\r\n\r\nNEW THIS YEAR: Register to accept online pledges.  More details coming soon.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions, comments, concerns<\/b>\r\nContact friendly neighbourhood Smith for more info.
