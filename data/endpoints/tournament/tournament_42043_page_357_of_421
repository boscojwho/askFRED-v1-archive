You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made.

Pools for Cadet events will fence, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. *Please note that Women's epee is the one exception, during which Junior events will come first, followed by Cadet events!*\r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 20 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility\r\nTo fence in JUNIOR events, fencer birth year must be between 2000-2006.\r\nTo fence in CADET events, fencer birth year must be between 2003-2006.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies BEFORE the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nNew padded chest protectors are required for foil. (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/news_article\/show\/922236)\r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Typically pools begin approximately 15 minutes after close of check-in, tournament conditions permitting.  Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.   \r\n\r\n<I><b>HOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE I WILL BE FENCING?<\/I> <\/b> \r\nListen for announcements, and shortly after check-in closes pool strip assignments will be posted on-line at  https:\/\/fencingtimelive.com and on monitor tower located near the Bout Committee.

Once the pool sheet with fencer signatures is submitted there will be no changes made.   When <b>ALL<\/b> pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.  The DE tableau will be posted and you then report to the strip(s) indicated for your event and listen for the referee to call you.  Notify the referee if you need to leave the strip area for any reason.   You are allowed 2 calls to the strip, then if not present at the 3rd and final call you will be scratched.

There are a number of food options near our club.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 11AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED.  $25 at the door.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $15 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2019-2020 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership. Go to http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership to join.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Chest protectors are required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.  Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2006 or earlier\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":177656,"tournament_id":44881,"tournament":"2nd Annual MTFC Senior Mixed Epee - Andrew's Home!","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":26,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-11-30T11:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":45408,"name":"South Jersey Division 2020 JO Qualifier","start_date":"2019-11-30","end_date":"","comments":"You must be a USFA member (South Jersey Division) to compete in this event.

It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  No Y12 fencers in the team event, sorry.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  If we have a lot of people signed up we may use some imagination in the format; last year, for example, we ran a pool of teams, each round to a multiple of 3 rather than 5, each round to a max of 1 minute rather than 3.  At any rate, it will be a lot of fencing but will not go on until midnight.  \r\n\r\nIt's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA competitive membership required.  Masks, gloves, and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Committee\/Downloads\/fileDL.php?file_id=56\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections: The address is:\r\n\r\n500 College Dr.\r\nLake Jackson, TX 77566\r\n\r\nThe gym is on the NORTH end of campus.

In each event, the top 25% (rounded up) will qualify for JOs, with a minimum of 3.  Therefore, if 3 or fewer fencers are registered for an event, the event will not be fenced and all will qualify.\r\n\r\nFencers that earn qualification at the Junior events will automatically for the corresponding Cadet event (if age-eligible.)  \r\n\r\nWe are implementing a new process for JO Qualifiers this year that will save everyone time and money.  Please read the following process carefully.\r\n\r\nFirst, all entries must be pre-registered and paid on AskFred by 11:59 PM on November 26th.  NO ENTRIES WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE ENTRY DEADLINE.\r\n\r\nAfter the entry deadline, we will send an email announcing the following:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>If an event has 3 or fewer fencers that are not already qualified, the event will not be fenced.  All of the fencers that are registered will be considered qualified.<\/li>\r\n<li>If an event needs to be fenced, we will announce where the event will be held and the check-in times.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n-------- Entry Fees ---------\r\nAll fencers must pay the mandatory $10 registration fee when they sign up on AskFred.  \r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, each fencer will need to pay an ADDITIONAL $10 in CASH on the day of the event (to cover the cost of hiring referees.)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Tournament Rules -------- \r\nCadet events are open to fencers born in 2003-2006.\r\nJunior events are open to fencers born in 2000-2006.\r\n\r\nSince this is a national qualifier, all competitors must be current members of the USFA Western Washington Division and US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n \r\nPlease join or renew your USFA membership online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org prior to registering on AskFred.\r\n\r\nFor events that are fenced, full USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nBecause of the limited number of pistes, the total number of entries is limited to 28.

Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men's and women's locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.  Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7662645,"longitude":-73.9793074,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":176816,"tournament_id":44681,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #2 Men's Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":26,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-12-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":45711,"name":"\"Earn your \"E\" - Men's and Women's SABER","start_date":"2019-12-01","end_date":"","comments":"CF&F welcomes all UNRATED saber fencers to compete for E2019 USA Fencing classification.
