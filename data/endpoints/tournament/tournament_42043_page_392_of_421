Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/30\/2021\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Open to fencers born 2008 or earlier. Medals and classifications will be awarded.\r\n\r\nOn August 6th, 2016, the Bucks County Academy of Fencing suffered the sudden and unexpected loss of one of the longest established members of our coaching staff, Mitch Davis. After starting fencing in high school, Mitch joined the BCAF as a student in the mid 1980's and had been a member of the BCAF coaching staff for over 25 years.  He was a kind and caring man who inspired his students with his infectious enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mitch was an avid Revolutionary War historian and re-enactor.  His passion for both fencing and history touched many lives in both communities and sparked a life-long interest in many young people.  \r\n \r\nWith this competition, we honor his memory.\r\n\r\n<b>USA FENCING COVID GUIDELINES\r\n\"All attendees at USA Fencing tournaments will be required to wear a mask at all times, including athletes during competition. Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul mask or shield or similar face coverings are not permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate.\"<\/b>\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free onsite parking!

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we instituted a policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\n<b>FEES:\r\n\r\n**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 3\/16\/20. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).<\/b>\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n<b>$50 at the door for late registrations (after 3\/16\/22) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY).<\/b> \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMIXED FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Unlike\r\nmost of the fencing tournaments we've ever been to, we can't take cash!\r\n\r\nThe payment system is called Recshop, and you will need to set up an account as a community member.\r\nOn the plus side, you can now pay by credit card. Click\r\nhttps:\/\/www.recshop.ohio.edu\/Program\/GetProgramDetails?courseId=b082f25f-aaef-4935-9c9d-0175a50eb773&semesterId=7e91a335-45d2-43b5-8c4d-416dc2f1155b  to access the system.\r\nThe first event is $20. If registering for more than one event, it is $10 per extra event. Refunds will be available if for some reason you can't make it.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Events and Equipment<\/b>\r\nThe Senior Events are USFA sanctioned. USFA membership is required as well as the standard fencing uniform (plastrons required, knickers required, FIE gloves for Sabre are required as of October 2015).\r\n\r\nThe NEW chest protector requirements are also in effect for foil.

Ping is on South side of campus along South Green Drive. Enter through the main doors, tell them you're with the fencing tournament, and turn left to Gym C.\r\n\r\nPARKING: All parking in Dark Green and Purple lots is free on Weekends EXCEPT those spaces marked with a sign that says Pay by Plate. The Pay by Plate spots are paid at a local machine and are monitored 24\/7.  A parking map can be found at https:\/\/www.ohio.edu\/transportation-parking\/map. There is a link to a pdf version. Ping Recreational Center is Building 91 (H-7) on the map. \r\nLots 87 and 93 are the most convenient, but double check for \"Pay by Plate\" signs. Lots 133 (Walter Fieldhouse), 132 (Stadium) and 134 (Walter Hall) are all fair game with the exception of labelled pay spots.\r\n\r\nYou can show up as early as 8AM to get in and settled.\r\nRegistration and equipment check will start about 8:40.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Saber (9AM)\r\nSenior Mixed Foil (11AM)\r\nSenior Mixed Epee (2PM)\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Ping Center, Ohio University","address":"Ping Center, athens OH, 45701","city":"Athens","state":"OH","zip":"45701","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.321203,"longitude":-82.0987529,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":18,"name":"Columbus","abbrev":"COLM","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194202,"tournament_id":49820,"tournament":"8th Annual Fence Fest  Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":28,"prereg_count":31,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-02T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194203,"tournament_id":49820,"tournament":"8th Annual Fence Fest  Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":13,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-02T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194204,"tournament_id":49820,"tournament":"8th Annual Fence Fest  Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":18,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-02T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50094,"name":"Appalachian State Open 2022","start_date":"2022-04-02","end_date":"","comments":"Each event will be $15 a person.\r\n\r\nIf possible we also ask that each club bring some extra strips, extension cords and possibly some folks to ref.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 11:30 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 11:30 PM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\n<b>Current valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
