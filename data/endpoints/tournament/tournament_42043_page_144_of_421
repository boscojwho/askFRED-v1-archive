If you are not sure if you can make it, just pre-register without pre-pay.  You can always go back into your AskFred Account and pre-pay up until the cut-off date. AskFred charges an extra $0.99 fee.  \r\n\r\n*For those who pre-register, please UN-REGISTER yourself or email\/call us if you cannot attend our events. Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season. After the 3rd infringement, your registration will need pre-approval, and an additional fee of $10 will be collected and DONATED to the American Red Cross upon check-in.  \r\n\r\ne: hello[at]redstarfencing.com    \"@\" replaces [at]\r\np: +1 773 349 3074\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 12\/20\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on FRI 02\/17\/2012 at 11:59PM CT.\r\n","venue":{"name":"REDSTAR FENCING CLUB","address":"3735 W BELMONT AVE","city":"CHICAGO","state":"IL","zip":"60618","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":41.9391015,"longitude":-87.7212411,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73773,"tournament_id":17524,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-19T08:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":73774,"tournament_id":17524,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":20,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-19T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":73775,"tournament_id":17524,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-19T08:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":73776,"tournament_id":17524,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":23,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-19T11:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":73777,"tournament_id":17524,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":27,"prereg_count":34,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-19T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":15790,"name":"Bergen-Passaic Frosh-Soph Tournament","start_date":"2012-02-19","end_date":"","comments":"This is the Bergen Passaic Fencing League's Freshman\/Sophomore Tournament.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73953,"tournament_id":17585,"tournament":"Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-19T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17610,"name":"Bay Cup @ HFC: VWE3, VXE3","start_date":"2012-02-19","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2012-01-25","prereg_close":"2012-02-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nVet Combined Women's Epee\r\nVet Combined Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a Bay Cup tournament.

All of these locations offer a range of hotel options, and on-site or nearby restaurant choices.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to stay close to the airport, hotels with airport shuttle service and parking (Ramada, Days Inn, Courtyard, Fairfield, La Quinta, Holiday Inn, Quality Inn, Super 8, Springhill Suites, Staybridge) are 5-10 minutes by shuttle from the terminal, and 25 miles\/35 minutes to Denver Fencing Center.\r\n\r\nThe Downtown\/Convention Center\/Performing Arts Center location (Hyatt Regency, Brown Palace, Magnolia, Marriott, Doubletree, Hilton Gardens, Embassy Suites) is about 25 miles\/35 minutes from DIA, and 7.5miles\/20 minutes from DFC.  It is served by the Super Shuttle from DIA for 19 dollars per person.  Flat rate cab fare to the downtown area is 54.75 dollars.  RTD light rail runs from the Theater District\/Convention Center stop to the Evans stop, and then DFC is about a mile walk to the west. \r\nSee rtd-denver.com\r\n\r\nIf you're combining the fencing tournament with a little vacation, the downtown area includes the Denver Art Museum, Coors Field, the Denver Performing Arts Center, the Tattered Cover bookstore, the US Mint and many, many choices for shopping and dining.\r\n\r\nThe Southwest area at Hampden and Wadsworth (Holiday Inn, La Quinta, Courtyard, Residence Inn, Best Western) is 6.5 miles\/17 minutes from the venue, 36 miles\/45 minutes from DIA.  Good if you're headed further west for some snow sports after the tournament.\r\n\r\nIf you are coming in from the south, the area along I-25 between County Line Road and Arapahoe (Homewood Suites, Courtyard, Residence Inn, Sleep Inn) is 15 miles\/30 minutes from Denver Fencing Center, 35 miles\/40 minutes to DIA.  Park Meadows Mall is here, and there is also a light rail station.  Just to the west along 470 is a Courtyard and a Residence Inn.  \r\n\r\nDenver Fencing Center has easy driving availability to a number of restaurants and Starbucks.  There will be sports drinks, energy bars and bananas available at the venue for minimal purchase price.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Denver Fencing Center","address":"1930 South Navajo Street","city":"Denver","state":"CO","zip":"80223","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":39.681705,"longitude":-105.0038019,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":48,"name":"Colorado","abbrev":"CO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":68664,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":14,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-25T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":68665,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-25T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":68666,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":26,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-26T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":68667,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-25T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":68668,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-26T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":68669,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-26T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":69114,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"VetCombined Men's Foil","short_name":"VCmMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-25T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":69116,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"VetCombined Women's Foil","short_name":"VCmWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-25T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":69119,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"VetCombined Men's Epee","short_name":"VCmME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-26T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":69121,"tournament_id":16184,"tournament":"ROC of the Rockies - DIV II\/VET","full_name":"VetCombined Men's Saber","short_name":"VCmMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-26T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":16956,"name":"3 Quacks collegiate -- NON USFA","start_date":"2012-02-25","end_date":"","comments":"Come join us at the annual Three Quacks Tournament hosted by the University of Oregon Fencing Club at the Northwest Fencing Center!","prereg_open":"2011-11-18","prereg_close":"2012-02-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This tournament is open to collegiate fencers and is not USFA sanctioned.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73959,"tournament_id":17591,"tournament":"Div. 3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-26T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15810,"name":"Youth Saber Liberty Cup #3","start_date":"2012-02-26","end_date":"","comments":"$35 for MFC members with prepayment in MFC office, $40 for non members, or $50 without any prepayment at the door.
