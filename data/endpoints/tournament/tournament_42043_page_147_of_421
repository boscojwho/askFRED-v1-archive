If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73954,"tournament_id":17586,"tournament":"Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-03-25T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17605,"name":"NEUSFA - Y14 Quals @ BFC NEW ENGLAND ONLY","start_date":"2012-03-25","end_date":"","comments":"New Eng Div Y14 Summer Nationals Qualifiers @ Boston Fencing Club.\r\nMust be US citizen or permanent resident.\r\n\r\nPreregistration Required - Please Don't Wait!

Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification.  \r\n\u0095 Only official ratings and points will be used (i.e. published on the USFA website).   Check your rating and your point standing prior to the event and if there are discrepancies you must resolve the issue with USFA.  Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website.   Current national points: http:\/\/usfencing.org\/national-points-standings\/current-national-points\r\n\u0095 It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting).  \r\n\u0095 Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately.  Once DE round starts pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\u0095 Check all scores before leaving the strip.  Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n<i>Format:<\/i>\r\n\u0095 Only  events with fewer than 5 entries of one gender will be mixed.  For events with less than 6 fencer and\/or are fenced mixed, national points are not awarded.  <i>(Athlete Handbook 3.2.2  - Senior, Junior, Cadet, ROC, SYC tournaments are required to have at least 6 competitors for points to be awarded and cannot be a mixed competition.  If there are less than 10 competitors there must fence off 3rd place).<\/i>\r\n\r\nEach event consists of two rounds (pools and direct elimination)\r\n\u0095 Pools: One round of 5-touch\/3 minute bouts. 100% advance to direct elimination rounds. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Direct Elimination: For Y14, DE bouts are 15 touch\/9-minute bouts. For Y10-Y12, DE bouts are 2 of 3 5-touch bouts. During the 1-minute breaks, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\r\n\u0095 No fence-off for third place. Medals awarded to Top 8. <i>If there are less than 10 competitors there must be fence off for 3rd place.<\/i>\r\n\r\n\u0095 SYC competitions award points to the top 40% of the field regardless of where the cut-off occurs, i.e. if there are 17 fencers  40% of 17 is 6.8 - only the top 6 finishers (not top 7) earn points.  <i>SYC tournaments are required to have at least 6 competitors for points to be awarded.<\/i> \r\n\r\n\u0095 Classifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications.  View USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/assets.usoc.org\/assets\/documents\/attached_file\/filename\/15801\/Classification_Chart_2009.pdf\r\n\r\n<i>Withdrawal: <\/i>\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part (o.20)\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE:  When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence, or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout.  A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition (o.25)\r\n\r\n<i>Uniform\/equipment requirements:<\/i>\r\n\u0095 USFA uniform requirements apply. Names are NOT required on uniform.\r\n\u0095 Y10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32 inches (i.e. 2\" or \"0\" blades).\r\n\u0095 Equipment check will be open each day.  Fencers must present to the armorer for testing of mask, lame jacket, gloves (saber) and body cords.  Items passing inspection will be specially marked.  Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"  \r\n\u0095 You must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords.    Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition.  Two vendors will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services.  \r\n\r\n<b>SPECTATORS<\/b>\r\nSpectators are obliged not to interfere with the good order of a competition, to do nothing which may tend to influence the fencers or the Referee, and to respect the decisions of the latter even when they do not agree with them.
