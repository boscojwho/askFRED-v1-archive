Each team must have one male fencer and one female fencer. You will need to be a member of US Fencing to compete, but since this is not a sanctioned tournament, you only need have a non-competitive level membership.  Cost per team: $45.\r\n\r\nFormat is a round robin.  Each team member will fence every other team's representative in their weapon, i.e. your epeeist will fence the epeeist on every other team.  The team's total of won vs. lost bouts will determine the winner.\r\n\r\nRound up another fencer or two and form your team prior to the event start time at 1:00 pm Saturday, but if you do not have a team, you can show up and be put on a team.  This is always a good time, and the members of the winning team will have their names put on the Mile High Team Trophy.  Also, last year the cookies were awesome.\r\n\r\nIt will help if people can form and pre-register their teams ahead of time.  askfred.net doesn't have a mixed weapon option, so pretend that the team registration event is actually \"Three Weapon\", and not foil.  Pick out a team name, make sure you have at least 1 male and 1 female on your team, and figure out who is going to fence which weapon for you.  Then proceed to register the team on askfred.  Contact your coach if you haven't got teammates, and see if they can help you put together a group, or come over to DFC the day of the tournament, and we'll see if we can put something together.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 9\/3\/14. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 9\/3\/14) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN\u0092S EPEE:       10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN\u0092S EPEE:     1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2000-2003\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=27708\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/12\/2014\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

All USFA Foil Events require mask with conductive bibs and mask cords.\r\n\r\nYouth Development Practice Tournaments: DESF will begin a new format for practice tournaments for youth. This format is designed to assist youth to have a fuller learning experience at fencing tournaments and to address youth events that have had historically low turnouts. The format involves fencers as volunteer mentors to assist in creating bouting opportunities for youth with the goal of developing a stronger local field of youth fencers. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nNovice DESF Practice Tournaments: Novice Events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability. These events are sponsored by DESF as practice tournaments for new fencers and are not Northeast Division sanctioned USFA events. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nPre-registration & Entry Fees:\r\nUSFA sanctioned events:\r\nEntry fees: $20 per event at the door. $15 per event if you pre-register on Ask-FRED by Friday, 9\/12\/14. These fees only apply to DESF hosted tournaments. Pre-registration closes Friday, 9\/12\/14 at 9:00 PM.\r\n\r\nYouth Development & Novice events: $10 per event per person.\r\n\r\nCourtesy of pre-registration is highly encouraged, but those wishing to register at the door are welcome. All volunteer donations to the referee fund are welcome and highly appreciated to help pay or discount the entry fees of those who volunteer to referee. When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USFA Events will be awarded according to USFA tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Fencing Flea Market:\r\nDESF will provide tables for a flea market for fencing equipment. Fencers are welcome to bring used or new equipment they wish to trade, sell or donate. Price your own items, or John will be available to help you price any used equipment if you need assistance. Please ensure that the equipment you sell is clean and in good shape. If you are not sure if your used equipment is in good condition, bring it anyway ,and we can evaluate its condition. Important: Please provide contact information (name, telephone, e-mail) at the table, so that buyers may be in touch with sellers. Many new fencers may be looking to purchase used equipment for the first time. Contact information is important in the case the buyer will want to contact the seller directly.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.

If a fencer is forced off the back of the strip, it shall count as a touch to the fencer remaining on the strip. Going off the side is resolved as normal for sport fencing.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.

Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.**\r\n\r\nNJFA is a member of the NJ Division of the USFA http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event.
