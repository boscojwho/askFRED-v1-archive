Refund request should be sent to: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\n<b>BIRTH YEARS: <\/b>\r\nEligibility for events is determined by BIRTH YEAR, not age at time of participation. The Spruill Memorial 2 Blades events use the Age Classification Chart for birth year requirements and exceptions:  http:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility \r\nIf you are not eligible by BIRTH YEAR, but have NATIONAL POINTS for the age group one younger than the event you want to enter, you are eligible to fence in that age group. For example, if you are born in 2003, you may only enter JUNIOR if you are on the Cadet National Points List for the same weapon.\r\n\r\n<b>EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES:<\/b>\r\nStandard fencing uniforms without any rips, tears, or holes are required. Warm-up pants are not allowed. Names on uniforms are not required.\r\nFencing glove must cover half of the forearm. \r\nStandard fencing plastron (underarm protector) is required; women must wear chest protector.\r\nMask must pass a 12K punch test. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\nCords, lames, and masks are subject to standard electrical resistance checks.\r\n<b>****ARMORY EARLY CHECK-IN****<\/b>\r\nWeapons check will open Friday evening, 7-9 PM, for early check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>MEDALS<\/b>\r\nMedals will be given to the top 8 women and top 8 men in each age category.\r\nIf an event is fenced mixed, points are given to the placements regardless of gender, but the medals are given separately. For example, if Y10 Men's and Women's foil is fenced mixed and there is only one girl who places 6th; she will receive points for 6th place, but a 1st place medal.\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT FORMAT<\/b>\r\nAll events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per RYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. No fence off for 3rd place.\r\nY10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). \r\nY12, Y14, and Junior DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). \r\nDuring the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\r\n<b>SEEDING: <\/b>\r\nSeeding will be based on the following order: \u0084h \r\nCurrent National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification \u0084h Classification and year \u0084h \r\nIf athlete has neither National Points nor a weapon classification they are seeded on a random basis with the other athletes in the same situation \r\nFencers from the same club will be separated as much as possible in the first round of competition. Seeding will be posted prior to the posting of pools. \r\n\r\n<b>POINTS:<\/b>\r\n<ul><li><b>RYC:<\/b> Up to the best 3 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u00a1\u00a6s Regional Rank each season. \r\n<li><b>RJC:<\/b> Up to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u00a1\u00a6s Regional Rank each season.\r\n<li>There is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level.  (For example: Y12 regional points do NOT trickle down to Y10). \r\n<li>There IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the National Championships in Y14 and is age eligible for Y12, he\/she will also qualify in Y12) \r\n<li>There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. <\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>QUALIFICATIONS:<\/b>\r\n<ul><li><b>RYC:<\/b>  The RYC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10\/12 and 14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. Athletes who meet or exceed the pre-established point total (150pts\/Y14 and 60 pts\/Y12.) within the qualifying period will qualify. These athletes will not be skipped at the Y14 Divisional Qualifiers if they fall into the qualifying group. \r\n<li>Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament in the current season prior to the regular registration deadline for the March Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYC or SYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament qualification requirements. \r\n<li><b>RJC:<\/b> The RJCC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Cadet and Junior fencers to the Junior Olympic National Championships and the USA Fencing Summer Nationals July Challenge.  Athletes who meet or exceed the pre-established point total within the qualifying period for Junior Olympics (110) or the July Challenge (65), will qualify. These athletes will not be skipped at Divisional JO Qualifiers if they fall into the qualifying group.<\/ul>\r\n \r\n<b>TOURNAMENT STAFF:<\/b>\r\n<ul>Brenda Waddoups - Bout Committee Chair\r\nOvy Waddoups - Head Armorer\r\nAllen Cury - Referee Assigner\r\nAly Khamis - Referee Hiring Authority <\/ul>\r\n\r\nFor more information, email info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=39180\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/29\/2017\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

There will be foil events for all age groups, plus Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #3\r\nDate(s): 02\/24\/2018\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, February 24th, 2018\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $20 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2017-2018 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2003-2006\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=38280\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/23\/2018\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $40 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597.\r\n\r\n***Payment information***\r\n\r\nREVISED NO-SHOW POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall (267) 482-9597 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":156821,"tournament_id":39369,"tournament":"Liberty Open and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Saber","short_name":"CdMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-25T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":156822,"tournament_id":39369,"tournament":"Liberty Open and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-25T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":38097,"name":"Five Weapon D Meet","start_date":"2018-02-25","end_date":"","comments":"$15 entry fee.

Teams will fence one match with each of the other teams, one as the designated \"Home\" team and one as the designated \"Visiting\" team. Teams will schedule their own matches with each other, and will have until April 30th to compete matches and report results. In the event of 12 or more teams registering, the league coordinator will place the teams into two different geographically-based divisions (the ruling of the league coordinator in this instance is final and not subject to appeal). Home teams are responsible for arranging for and payment of referees for all hosted matches. Matches will be held at a venue designated by the Home team, and at a time agreed upon by both teams. Any matches not completed by April 30th will be scored as a Double Forfeit. \r\n\r\n<i>Playoff Season Competition<\/i>\r\nAfter the completion of Regular Season Competition, teams will be ranked according to win-loss percentage (see League Rules for concerning Forfeits), with ties be broken first by result of head-to-head competition, and second by total indicators. In the event of unbroken ties, the league coordinator will conduct a coin-flip in the presence of representatives from both teams to determine placement. <b>The top 4 placing teams<\/b> will be seeded into a standard direct elimination tableau, and playoff competition will commence on May 4th (in the event of a tie for 4th place, a fence off between the two teams will be conducted). The higher seeded team will be designated the \"Home\" team and the lower seeded team the \"Visiting.\" In the event geographic Divisions are used, each division will have its own bracket of 4 teams, to fence for a the Division Championships. The winners of each geographic Division will fence for the overall league championship. The League Coordinator reserves the right to adjust the Regular Season of competition if the number of teams is larger than expected. Guidelines for scheduling Playoff rounds will be published later in the season.\r\n\r\nA team may have no more than 2 of its matches scored as a Forfeit in order to participate in Playoff Season Competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>League Rules<\/b>\r\n<i>Match Rules<\/i>\r\nMatches will be conducted as 45-Touch Relay Format, according to the latest version of the USA Fencing Rules of Competition. The Visiting team designates which side of the scoresheet they will fence on (1-3 vs 4-6). Home Teams are responsible for payment (if any) of referees for all matches except for the Championship and Third-Place matches (and Division Championship matches, if required). Matches will be held at a venue designated by the Home team, and at a time agreed upon by both teams. Any matches not completed by April 30th will be scored as a Double Forfeit.\r\n\r\n<i>Team Member Participation<\/i>\r\nEach team member must team member must fence in at least one leg in two different matches in the regular season in order to be considered a member of the team for end of season awards and to be eligible for playoff participation.\r\n\r\n<i>Results Reporting<\/i>\r\nThe designated Home Team is responsible for reporting the results of competition using materials that the League Coordinator will make available after team registrations end.\r\n\r\n<i>Injury Substitution<\/i>\r\nSubstitutions during a match will follow standard rules as laid down in the latest version of the USA Fencing Rules of Competition.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a injury that will take a team member out of competition for a significant period of time (as determined by the Team Captain), a team member may be replaced. A team member replaced in this fashion is not eligible to participate in any additional team matches, but may still be eligible for end of season awards. Both the injured team member and the replacement's legs fenced will count together towards participation requirement.\r\n\r\n<i>Forfeitures<\/i>\r\nA Team that fails to present themselves for an arranged competition will score their match as a Forfeit. It will count in the standings as a 0-0 LOSS and may effect playoff eligibility. The opposing team must present conclusive proof to the league coordinator of the arrangement of the match.\r\n\r\nIf the team match is not completed by the end of the Regular Season the match will be scored as a Double Forfeit.\r\n\r\n<b>Awards to be presented<\/b>\r\nTeam Champion and Runner-Up.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs. Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated. If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get good with blade-work. Visualize every bout starting with you being backed up to the end of the strip. Try it - you'll like it!

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2005-20010) and Senior (2004 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 24 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates for the 2017-2018 events:\r\nAugust 26, 2017\r\nOctober 28, 2017\r\nNovember 18, 2017\r\nJanuary 20, 2017\r\nMarch 3, 2018\r\nApril 14, 2018\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462291,"longitude":-97.2377284,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151016,"tournament_id":38001,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #5","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-03-03T15:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151018,"tournament_id":38001,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #5","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-03-03T18:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151019,"tournament_id":38001,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #5","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":2,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-03-03T14:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39805,"name":"Mountain View Open","start_date":"2018-03-03","end_date":"","comments":"Join us at Mountain View Gym for a day of fun.\r\nTournaments under way by 9:30!\r\n\r\nGreat Practice for the Upcoming Hawaii Open!","prereg_open":"2018-02-07","prereg_close":"2018-03-02","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Mountain View Gym","address":"181345 A Volcano Rd.","city":"Mountain View","state":"HI","zip":"96771","country":"USA","timezone":"Pacific\/Honolulu","latitude":19.534945,"longitude":-155.125657,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":15,"name":"Hawaii","abbrev":"HI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":158433,"tournament_id":39805,"tournament":"Mountain View Open","full_name":"Unsanctioned Youth Mixed Foil","short_name":"YMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Youth","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-03-03T09:00:00-10:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158434,"tournament_id":39805,"tournament":"Mountain View Open","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-03-03T11:00:00-10:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39594,"name":"Yellow Jacket Open 2018","start_date":"2018-03-03","end_date":"2018-03-04","comments":"","prereg_open":"2018-01-15","prereg_close":"2018-02-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":10,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Mixed Epee (Registration closes at 12:30pm) (Sat)\r\nMixed Epee (Registration closes at 9:00am) (Sat)\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil (Registration closes at 11:00am) (Sun)\r\nMixed Foil (registration closes at 9:00am) (Sun)\r\nD & Under Mixed Saber (Registration closes at 2:00pm) (Sat)\r\nMixed Saber (Registration closes at 11:00am) (Sat)\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/15\/2018.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/23\/2018!\r\nPreregistration is uncapped.
