No further entries will be allowed and we can now announce which events will be fenced this weekend.\r\n\r\nThe following events WILL NOT be fenced. All registered fencers in these events are automatically qualified for Div II and Div III:\r\n\r\nDiv II\/III Women's Epee      \r\nDiv II\/III Women's Saber      \r\n\r\nThe following events WILL be fenced at SAS this Saturday according to the following schedule.  \r\nALL FENCERS COMPETING THIS WEEKEND MUST PAY AN ADDITIONAL $20 (cash only) AT THE DOOR.\r\n \r\n10am: Div II\/III Women's Foil\r\n10am: Div II\/III Men's Epee\r\n10am: Div II\/III Men's Saber\r\n2pm:  Div II\/III Men's Foil\r\n\r\nThe updated schedule, as well as a list of who qualified for the events that won't be fenced, can be found at https:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com?t=8406\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Tournament Info -------- \r\nFencers who want to fence at Summer Nationals in Division II or III must qualify at this event unless they have qualified via other means (such as regional or national points.)  In each event, the top 25% (rounded up) will qualify for Summer Nationals, with a minimum of 3.  Therefore, if 3 or fewer fencers are registered for an event, the event will not be fenced and all will qualify.\r\n\r\nIf you are not sure if you are already qualified, speak with your coach.  They should be able to tell you whether you need to attend this event or not.\r\n\r\nDivision II and III will be fenced as a single Division II (C & Under) event and the qualifiers for both Division II and III will be determined from the results.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- What about the Y14 qualifiers? -------- \r\nThe Youth-14 qualifier, which normally is held in conjunction with the Division II\/III qualifier,  will be held as a separate event on April 8th.  Registration for that event can be done at this link: \r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=52730\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- IMPORTANT PROCEDURE FOR QUALIFIERS --------\r\n\r\nWe are using the same process for Division II\/III Qualifiers that we have been using for JO Qualifiers.  This process will save everyone time and money.  Please read the following carefully.\r\n\r\nFirst, all entries must be pre-registered and paid on AskFred by 11:59 PM on March 20th.  NO ENTRIES WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE ENTRY DEADLINE.\r\n\r\nAfter the entry deadline, we will send an email announcing the following:\r\n\r\nIf an event has 3 or fewer fencers that are not already qualified, the event will not be fenced.  All of the fencers that are registered will be considered qualified.\r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, we will announce the time at which the event will be held.  \r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Entry Fees ---------\r\nAll fencers must pay the mandatory $10 registration fee when they sign up on AskFred.  \r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, each fencer will need to pay an ADDITIONAL $20 in CASH on the day of the event (to cover the cost of hiring referees.)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Tournament Rules -------- \r\nDivision II\/III events are open to fencers born in 2009 or earlier.\r\n\r\nSince this is a national qualifier, all competitors must be current competitive or \"access\" members of the USFA Western Washington Division and US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n \r\nPlease join or renew your USFA membership online at https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ prior to registering on AskFred.\r\n\r\nFor events that are fenced, full USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Saber fencers must have the 800N glove.\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark masks, lames, body cords, head cords, and gloves. Equipment inspection will be done on the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to pre-register online with FRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=52729\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"1415 Elliott Ave W","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","zip":"98119","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6306455,"longitude":-122.37407,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":204837,"tournament_id":52729,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":204838,"tournament_id":52729,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":4,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-03-25T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":204839,"tournament_id":52729,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":204840,"tournament_id":52729,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-03-25T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":204841,"tournament_id":52729,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-03-25T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":204842,"tournament_id":52729,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-03-25T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":52990,"name":"SIUE AFA Tournament","start_date":"2023-03-25","end_date":"2023-03-26","comments":"Hosted by the Amateur Fencing Association and Southern Illinois University Edwardsville.
