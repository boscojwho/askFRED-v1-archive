I realize this is a very late announcement, but Dynamo Fencing Club is proud to invite all of our friends from within and outside province to the Mens Epee tournament that concludes the national training camp in mens epee that is presently being held at our training facility. Aside from Dynamo's usual suspects, the tournament will feature 2006 World Championships brnze medalist and 1988 Olympic Bronze medalist Igor Tikhomirov, 2003 Cadet World Champion Jean Pierre Seguin, Joren Blom and Aaron Dixon (Sask. provincial Team), Mikael Lambert (Canadian Cadet National team) Igor Gantsevich, Tigran Bajgoric etc etc etc..... There will be no points awarded for this tournament since it is a last minue kind of deal, but with such a turnout, the 25$ entree fee will be well worth it. This is a unique opportunity to fence a number of very good fencers froum out of the province and we sincerely hope that many of you decide to take advantage of it.\r\nThus, \r\nThe tournament will take place this coming Saturday, December 9. The close of registration is 10 AM. Venue: Dynamo Fencing Club (go to www.dynamofencing.com for driving directions). \r\nFee: $25. All entrants must possess a minium of a recreational membership from the BCFA pus the CFF licence. (USFA equivalents are ok as well, of course). No preregistration is necessary!\r\nSo, if you're not planning to head out to the NAC held in Richmond, VA this weekend, there's no place better than Richmond BC for epee fencing this weekend!\r\nFeel free to email me back withany questions,\r\nDmitry Balashov, Dynamo Fencing Club\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: Epee Night In Canada\r\nDate(s): 12\/09\/2006\r\nLocation: Dynamo Fencing Club\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nMen's Epee  | Sat 12\/09 | 10:00 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=3088\r\nPreregistation closes on 12\/09\/2006\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you are interested in competing in this tournament, you must meet all age and citizenship qualification requirements, as well as qualify through your Division if you are not an automatic qualifier.  This means that if more than 3 fencers from the Alabama Division are interested in competing in the same event (e.g., Junior Women\u0092s Sabre) at Junior Olympics, then a qualifying competition must be held at the Division level. \r\n\r\nFencers must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States.  On the USFA membership card, a foreign fencer is designated with an asterisk after their first name.  Fencers must have a USFA \u0093Competitive Member\u0094 card with an expiration date of July 31, 2007 or later.\r\n\r\nTo fence in the Under 17 events, a fencer must have been born in 1990-1993, or be on the Y14 National Rolling Point Standings for that weapon.  To fence in the Under 20 events, a fencer must have been born in 1987-1993, or be on the Cadet National Rolling Point Standings for that weapon.\r\n\r\nTo be an automatic qualifier for the Under 17 Championships, a fencer must be on the Cadet National Rolling Point Standings on January 17, 2007, or in the top 8 of the Youth 14 National Rolling Point Standings on January 17, 2007, or have qualified for the Under 20 Junior Olympic Championships in that weapon.  To be an automatic qualifier for the Under 20 Championships, a fencer must be on the Junior National Rolling Point Standings on January 17, 2007, or in the top 16 of the Cadet National Rolling Point Standings on January 17, 2007.\r\n\r\nThe top 25% of the competitors at the qualifying tournament (no fewer than 3) will be eligible to compete in the Junior Olympics competition.  If it is necessary to hold a qualifying event for the Alabama Division, it will be held on Sunday, December 17, 2006.  The cost will be $25.00 to register for the first event and $10.00 to register for each additional event.  The tournament will be held at Salle Bosco, 488 Dan Crutcher Road, Toney, Alabama 35773.  Directions to Salle Bosco can be found on the club website at http:\/\/www.sallebosco.com.\r\n\r\nComplete details concerning the qualification procedure and requirements are set forth in the 2006-2007 Athlete Handbook, the full text of which is available on the USFA website at www.usfencing.org.\r\n\r\nBill Becker (Chairman of the Southeast Section of the USFA and an FOC Certified Referee Instructor and a level 3 referee in all 3 weapons) has agreed to be the head referee and head of bout committee for our Junior Olympic Qualifier.  He will also offer a Referee Clinic at Salle Bosco on Saturday, Dec. 16th, with a referee practical examination to follow the JO qualifying tournament on Sunday.\r\n\r\nYou must pre-register by December 11, 2006 in order to compete in this qualifying competition.  Your entry form and payment must be received by the Alabama Division Secretary no later than December 11, 2006.  You may pre-register on AskFred.net.  However, your pre-registration on AskFred.net is not complete until you have mailed your entry form and payment to Carol Gray Caldwell, Alabama Division Secretary, 985 Valley View Road, Indian Springs, Alabama 35124, and you have received an email confirmation of receipt of that entry form and payment.  Only then will your pre-registration appear on the listing of registrants for the tournament on AskFred.net.  If your name does not appear on the listing of registrants for the tournament on AskFred.net, then your entry form and payment have not been received and you are NOT registered for the qualifying tournament.   If you do not contact me before the December 11, 2006 deadline and make arrangements to get your entry form and payment to me no later than midnight on December 11, 2006, there is nothing I can do to register you for the qualifying tournament after that time.  The deadline will be strictly enforced.  Anyone checking AskFred.net at midnight on December 11, 2006 will see the complete listing of all fencers who are registered for each event.  If you have any questions or any problems registering on AskFred.net, please contact Carol Gray Caldwell at 205-988-0947 before the December 11, 2006 deadline.\r\n\r\nYou will be notified by email, at the email address you have listed for your account on AskFred.net, on December 12, 2006, of the times for each event for this tournament, and of any events which will not be held due to the small number of fencers registered for that event.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at CGCwell@aol.com or at 205-988-0947.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCarol Gray Caldwell\r\nAlabama Division Secretary\r\n\r\n \r\nALABAMA DIVISION\r\nJUNIOR OLYMPIC QUALIFIER\r\nDECEMBER 17, 2006\r\n\r\nName:____________________________________\r\nClub:___________________\r\nAddress:__________________________________\r\nDivision:________________\r\nCity:_____________________ \r\nState:_______  \r\nZip:______  \r\n\/  \/Male    \/  \/ Female\r\nBirth Date:_____\/ ________\/________\r\nUSFA Number:____________________\r\n\r\nFees ($25 for the first event; $10 for each additional event):\r\n\t\t\t\t\t\r\nTotal Fees:  $_______________\r\n\r\nPlease make checks payable to the Alabama Division of the USFA.\r\n\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Epee _____\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Foil _____\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Saber _____\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Epee _____\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Foil _____\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Saber _____\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Epee _____\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Foil _____\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Saber _____\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Epee _____\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Foil _____\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Saber _____\r\n\r\nMail to:  Carol Gray Caldwell \r\nSecretary, Alabama Division, USFA\r\n985 Valley View Road\r\nIndian Springs, Alabama  35124\r\n\r\nEntry Form and payment must be received no later than December 11, 2006!\r\n\r\nWaiver\r\nI hereby waive and release all rights and claims for damages I may have against the Alabama Division of the U.S. Fencing Association, Salle Bosco, the United States Fencing Association, the officials, managers, sponsors, and other participants from any and all liabilities arising from illness, losses, injuries, or damages I may suffer as a result of my participation in the Alabama Division Junior Olympic qualifying fencing tournament.
