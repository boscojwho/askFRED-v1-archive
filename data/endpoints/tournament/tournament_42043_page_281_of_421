A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<I>SPECTATORS:<\/I>\r\n\r\nEverybody taking part in or present at a fencing competition must remain orderly and must not disturb the smooth running of the competition.

A percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National Championships and for the JO Championships in Junior and Cadet. In addition, athletes who accumulate a pre-established point total within the qualifying period for Junior Olympics (110) or the July Challenge (65), will qualify, whether or not they fall into the qualifying percent. Up to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional Rank each season. Athletes still can also qualify for the JOs through the National Rolling Point Standings and Division qualifying events. In addition to the RJCCs, athletes also can qualify for the July Challenge through the NRPS.\r\n\r\n There is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. There IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. \r\n\r\n For Summer Nationals\/July Challenge, qualification is finalized after the last RJCC event in each region. RJCC points are considered seasonal. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website. The USFA Athlete Handbook contains detailed information on qualifying pathways, and should be consulted as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\n Foreign fencers may compete in RJCCs and earn RRPS and may use this path to compete in the July Challenge; however, they are not eligible to compete at the Junior Olympics because it is a National Championship.

RYC serves as qualifying event for the March Youth NAC and 2017 Summer National Championships, and regional point standing events for Y10, Y12, and Y14.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level. A percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National Championships for Y12 and Y14. Currently, 100% of Y10 fencers on the Regional Points Standings and National Points Standings gain qualification to the Summer National Championships. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. Y10 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC during the current season to be eligible for the Y10 Summer National Championships. All athletes whose USA Fencing's membership division is in the region in which the RYC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and then Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes residing in the region in which the tournament is held earn regional points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Best 3 results from RYCs within the athlete's region count toward Regional point totals on a seasonal point basis. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 regions will be recognized by the Youth Development Committee, Tournament Committee and US Fencing. \r\n\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Youth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12 regional points do NOT trickle down to Y10). \r\n\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well.

The exemption to this rule applies to any fencer who is younger than 13 on January 1 but who is listed on the latest National Junior Point standings; then that fencer is allowed to compete in the USA Fencing competitions not specific to an age group. The athlete must meet any other criteria stated for that competition. Examples of such non-specific competitions are: \"Open\", \"Unclassified\", \"A\" competitions, \"C\" or under competitions, Team competitions of any category unless specified for juniors or similar age restricted category.","venue":{"name":"The Fencing Center of San Jose","address":"1290 South First Street","city":"San Jose","state":"CA","zip":"95110","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.31803,"longitude":-121.87484,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":137365,"tournament_id":34719,"tournament":"TFC's November 2016 Epee-A-Thon","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-06T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":137366,"tournament_id":34719,"tournament":"TFC's November 2016 Epee-A-Thon","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":25,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-06T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":34987,"name":"Inland Fencing Academy Youth Foil 3","start_date":"2016-11-06","end_date":"","comments":"Former host to So Cal Youth Challange","prereg_open":"2016-09-15","prereg_close":"2016-11-14","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Inland fencing Academy","address":"10144 Central ave","city":"Montclair","state":"CA","zip":"91763","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":34.0695818,"longitude":-117.6896359,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":8,"name":"San Bernardino","abbrev":"SNBER","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":138427,"tournament_id":34987,"tournament":"Inland Fencing Academy Youth Foil 3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-06T14:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":138428,"tournament_id":34987,"tournament":"Inland Fencing Academy Youth Foil 3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-06T11:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":139611,"tournament_id":34987,"tournament":"Inland Fencing Academy Youth Foil 3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-06T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":34994,"name":"2017 Junior Olympic Qualifiers","start_date":"2016-11-06","end_date":"","comments":"Registration now closed, event times finalized.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2016-17 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2017, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 2000-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1998-2004 and for the cadet events 2001-2004.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661675,"longitude":-73.9793986,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":139878,"tournament_id":35310,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #2 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":18,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-06T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":35197,"name":"NJFA - Div III & Y-14 M&W Foil November 8","start_date":"2016-11-08","end_date":"","comments":"Close of check-in promptly 6:00PM!!

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.**\r\n\r\nNJFA is a member of the NJ Division of the USFA http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2004-2009) and Senior (2003 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Novice Level events will be seeded at Random. Intermediate events will be seeded utilizing the Intermediate Series Points list. Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 12 attendees)\r\n3:00 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 12 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nWe will hold six of these between August 2016 and June 2017, and the points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462291,"longitude":-97.2377284,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":140556,"tournament_id":35478,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-12T15:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":140558,"tournament_id":35478,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":13,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-12T18:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":140677,"tournament_id":35478,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-12T12:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":35228,"name":"Flagstaff Unsanctioned Novice Tournament","start_date":"2016-11-12","end_date":"","comments":"This is the first of three unsanctioned novice tournaments planned for this season by Southwest Fencing Club and Phoenix Falcons.\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2016-10-07","prereg_close":"2016-11-11","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"THIS TOURNAMENT IS NOT A SANCTIONED USFA TOURNAMENT.
