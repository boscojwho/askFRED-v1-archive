During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2005-20010) and Senior (2004 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 24 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates for the 2017-2018 events:\r\nAugust 26, 2017\r\nOctober 28, 2017\r\nNovember 18, 2017\r\nJanuary 20, 2017\r\nMarch 3, 2018\r\nApril 14, 2018\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462291,"longitude":-97.2377284,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151004,"tournament_id":37998,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #2","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-28T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151005,"tournament_id":37998,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #2","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-28T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151006,"tournament_id":37998,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #2","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-28T18:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":38520,"name":"Alaska State Championships","start_date":"2017-10-28","end_date":"2017-10-29","comments":"","prereg_open":"2017-09-13","prereg_close":"2017-10-27","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":30,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"The first day of fencing will be held at Pacific Northern Academy, \r\nlocated at 9251 Lake Otis Parkway, Anchorage, AK 99507. \r\n\r\nAfter the foil event there will be a Division meeting to discuss ideas of what you would like to see happen in the division, things that the division board is working towards, and Division elections.

Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2003-2006\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=38278\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/03\/2017\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Cadet events must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. See USFA\r\nratings chart at:\r\nhttp:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating and points standing are correct with the USFA, and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Current-Membership-Listing\r\nCurrent points standings can be verified here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Athlete-Info\/Rankings\/Current-Rankings.aspx\r\n\r\nFencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee immediately.\r\nFencer signature on pool score sheets and DE bout slip implies accuracy. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the Bout Committee immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). Once DE round starts, pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all results before leaving the strip.\r\nFencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. There IS trickle down for Qualification at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAbout RJCC Tournaments:\r\n\r\nFrom US Fencing's Athlete Handbook (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athlete-handbook):\r\n\r\nRegional Junior\/Cadet Circuit (RJCC): The RJCCs serve as one of the\r\nqualification paths for Junior Olympic Fencing Championships and the July Challenge. There are no national points awarded at RJCC\r\ncompetitions; please refer to Chapter 3 for more information on the\r\nRegional Point structure. The Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is a ranking program designed to recognize and reward both participation and accomplishment at the RJCC Tournament level.\r\n\r\nRegional Point Standings for Youth, Cadet and Junior reflect an\r\nathlete\u0092s results at RYC and\/or RJCC tournaments within their home\r\nregion (based on division affiliation). These point standings are\r\nposted online and are updated within five business days after the\r\ntournament organizer has properly submitted results, event officials\r\nform, membership forms and paid the program service fee. For more\r\ninformation on this point system please visit \u0096\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/2292457-regional. These point standings\r\nare not used for seeding, only National Point Standings are used for\r\nseeding at regional tournaments.\r\n\r\nFencers only earn points at RJCCs within their home region (region is\r\nassigned based on division affiliation). The best 2 results count\r\ntowards the point total. These points may qualify Cadet and Junior\r\nfencers to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and July Challenge. Points earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of National Point Standings, for seeding or team selection purposes; they are only reflected in Regional Point\r\nStandings. Using the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants: ((#entries \u0096 place +1) \/ # entries) x 100 points The winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in\r\nthe event, regardless of the region. Regional RJCC points are only\r\nearned in the fencers own region.\r\n\r\nThe Cadet Regional Tournament is offered as part of the Regional\r\nJunior Cadet Circuit (RJCC). No national points are awarded; regional\r\npoints are awarded to any competitor competing in their home region. Regional points are awarded based on final placement and the size of the competitive field.\r\n\r\nA. Eligibility (age, classification) Subject to the exceptions in\r\nTable 2.5.1, fencers must be at least 13 years old on 1 January in the\r\nyear of the competition.

Other competitive opportunities in the ROC tournaments are provided for Veteran (40 & Older) and Division II (C, D, E or U) fencers.   ROC tournaments are open to current USA Fencing competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses.   However, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USA Fencing National Championship events. In the event that a foreign fencer finishes within the qualifying group, the foreign fencer will be skipped and only the highest-finishing eligible domestic fencers will qualify. \r\nIn each ROC category (Division I-A, Division II, and Veterans) competitions will award points to the top 40% of the competitive field (rounded up to the next higher integer) to a maximum of 64th place, using the point tables for regional competitions found in The Athlete\u0092s Handbook  Appendix 2.5.   Only the best 3 results, in each respective category, count towards the point total. These points may qualify D1A, DV2, and Veteran ROC fencers to the USA Fencing National Championships in D1A, DV2, DV3, and Veteran.    The ROC point standings are not used for seeding National level tournaments.  Only ROC events award regional ranking points.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Entry is determined by 2017-18 USA Fencing birth year requirements and rating restrictions: \r\nDiv I-A (any rating): Born 2004 or before, or on the Junior National Rolling Points List \r\nDiv2  (C,D,E or U rating): Born 2004 or before\r\n\r\n<b>==============================<\/b>\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT STAFF<\/b>\r\n<b>==============================<\/b>\r\nEscrime Management: George Janto, David Sapery, Cheryl Delaney, Lisa Campi-Sapery\r\nReferee Coordinator\/Head Referee: Lisa Campi Sapery (If interested in working as a referee, contact Lisa at lisasapery@hotmail.com)\r\nArmory:   Armory services available (for fee)\r\n\r\n<b>==============================<\/b>\r\n<b>REGISTRATION AND EVENT FEES<\/b>\r\n<b>==============================<\/b>\r\n\r\nTournament fees must be PAID for entry to be complete (your entry is \u0093incomplete\u0094 until payment (or payment arrangement) is made.

A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<I>SPECTATORS:<\/I>\r\n\r\nEverybody taking part in or present at a fencing competition must remain orderly and must not disturb the smooth running of the competition.
