The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

He earned his Maitre de Sabre certification in 2009 from the US Fencing Coaches Association.  His certification is recognized by the 17 country members of the Acadamie d'Armes Internationale, the international fencing coaches organization. \r\n\r\nMaitre Yung has trained fencers domestic and foreign.  His fencers competed in cadet, junior, senior and veteran levels in domestic and international tournaments including the Olympics.  The record for his two students over the last six Veteran World Championships include 9 individual golds, 4 individual silvers, and 4 team golds.\r\nWang Yung, the fencer, has been on 14 US Veteran World Teams and has won 7 Veteran World Championships medals including individual and team golds. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n2018-2019 TRI-STATE VETERAN SABER CUP\u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThis is one of the events in the 2018-2019 Tri-State Saber Veteran Cup. 2018-2019 will be the 5th season of the Cup.\u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\nThe Cup regularly produces B1-rated Vet MS events and some of the largest Vet WS non-NAC\u00c2\u00a0tournaments in the country. \u00c2\u00a0 Occasionally, tournament organizers will add a second aspect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 e.g., a clinic the day before, a Senior Open MS or allowing women to also participate in the MS event (i.e., make the MS event a Mixed Saber). \r\n\u00c2\u00a0 \r\nCompetitors regularly attend from the East Coast and visitors from farther away are always welcome (and can occasionally find a Vet fencer to host those who need a place to stay). \u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\nIn addition to awards for each individual tournament, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2018-2019 Cup Point Standings at the end of the season will receive awards. \u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\n2018-2019 Season Cup Points for each fencer will be calculated as follows:\u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\n1. The sum of that fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4 best results across all 2018-2019 Cup events (if they compete in 4 or fewer events, all of the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s results will count).\u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\n2. Points awarded to fencers at each event will depend on their finish and the number and letter rating of other participants in the event as follows: \r\na. Each participating fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (U=2, E=3, D=4, C=5, B=6, A=7)\u00c2\u00a0 \r\nb. Each fencer will earns the number of points equal to the total value of all the fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points. \r\nc. In the case of Vet Mixed Events, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) that finish below them. \r\n\r\n2018-2019 Tri-State Veteran Saber Cup Events (as of August 20, 2018): \r\n\r\nSeptember 30 - Lilov Fencing Academy (Cedar Grove, NJ)\u00c2\u00a0-\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 https:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=41191\r\n\r\nNovember 1H \/ October 2H - Location TBC \r\n\r\nJanuary 1 -\u00c2\u00a0 Tim Morehouse Fencing Center (Port Chester, NY) -\u00c2\u00a0 https:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.phptournament_id=41180 \u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\nJanuary 27 - Manhattan Fencing Center (Manhattan, NY)\u00c2\u00a0- AskFred details to come \r\n\r\nMarch 10 - Sheridan Fencing Center (Manhattan or Westchester, NY\u00c2\u00a0 - AskFred details to come\u00c2\u00a0 \r\n\r\nJune 16 -\u00c2\u00a0 Infinity Fencing Alliance (Woolwich Township, NJ) -\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0 https:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=41218 \r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInfinity Fencing Alliance is a 3,300 sq ft facility with wooden floors, 7 FIE size regulation strips with state-of-the-art VSM computerized scoring machines and free Wifi.
