There are a few things you should know about this unique competiton.  First and foremost this event is reminiscent of the first modern day olympic games.. that is, all these events will be fenced OUTDOORS.  Two slightly elevated, full length plywood fencing strips will be set up under a massive tent.  Full electric scoring will be used.  This is a USFA sanctioned event so Philadelphia Division USFA medals will be awarded along with ratings for the senior events.  All rules, especially clothing, will be enforced. Saturday's Y-10 youth fencers MUST use a size # 2 blade.  This is the 3rd year in a row Circle d'Escrime has organized and ran this competition.  It gets better every year!  It is important to sign up early.  There is a cap to the number of competitors for all events except for Sunday evening's epee event.  Youth event fencers will receive ribbons to 8th place and also Sportsfest medals for first through third and Trophies for first through third!!!  Senior events will be awarded Philadelphia Division medals and Sportsfest medals for first, second and third.  This is a huge festival.  There are over 40 different sports and activites going on through out the weekend, plus food vendors, games and the fitness expo!
