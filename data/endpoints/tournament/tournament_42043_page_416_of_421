Please check your membership card before registering.  \r\n\r\nThe top 25% of competitors (rounded up, minimum of 3 qualifiers in each event) will qualify for the Y14 national championships in their respective weapon.  Events with three or fewer paid entries will not be fenced.

No walk-in registration.\r\nFees payable are determined by the day you pay, not the day you sign up on FRED.  Only registrations paid in full are considered complete.  Signing up via FRED with no payment makes you a pending registrant, and not officially registered.  To pay by check or for questions about payment, contact Matthew Mitchell, mdmitchell@comcast.net, 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must present proof of current USFA and Philadelphia Division membership at check-in (membership card printed out or stored as a picture on your phone).  Fencers whose date of birth is not verified (see your membership card) may bring proof of age (birth certificate, driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license, passport) to check-in, and that information will be forwarded to the National Office.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must have the necessary equipment in conformance with USFA rules and in good condition.  Equipment will not be supplied by the host or the Division.  Chest protectors used by foil fencers must be covered in soft material and must be worn below the plastron.  All sabre gloves must meet the 800 NM standard.  \r\n\r\nDressing rooms are not available at the Pavilion. Fencers must arrive properly dressed, or in appropriate attire to permit dressing in the main fencing area. Rest rooms will be available, but should not be used as dressing rooms.\r\n\r\nFencers, coaches, and officials should not enter the venue if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms of respiratory infection, if they have had a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding 10 days, or if they have been in close contact with a person who was positive for COVID-19 in the preceding 5 days.  Fencers who are prevented from competing in the various qualifying events due to COVID-19 restrictions will be able to petition for entry to the National Championships.  Petitions are handled by the National Office, not the Division.\r\n\r\nBy attending this tournament, you agree that within 10 days of the date of the event, you have not tested positive for COVID-19, or been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. Additionally, you release and hold harmless US Fencing, USFA Philadelphia Division, Temple University, and tournament staff from any and all liability regarding COVID-19 transmission. While state and local regulations will be followed and every other reasonable precaution will be taken, there is an inherent transmission risk associated with being in any public place.","venue":{"name":"Temple University Pavilion","address":"1941 North 15th St.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19121","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9825493,"longitude":-75.158755,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":203790,"tournament_id":52400,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2023 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-06T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"},{"id":203791,"tournament_id":52400,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2023 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-06T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"},{"id":203792,"tournament_id":52400,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2023 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-06T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"},{"id":203793,"tournament_id":52400,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2023 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-06T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"},{"id":203794,"tournament_id":52400,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2023 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-06T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"},{"id":203795,"tournament_id":52400,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2023 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-06T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"}]},{"id":51393,"name":"SAS Saber D & Under","start_date":"2023-05-06","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2022-08-25","prereg_close":"2023-05-05","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"<b>SAS SABER: D & UNDER<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE<\/b>\r\nNoon -- D & Under Senior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\n<b>ENTRY<\/b>\r\nOpen to all fencers born 2009 or earlier rated D or E, or without a rating.

Event times will be posted 6 days prior to event when registration is closed. Many of these events will not be fenced, so scheduling them is impossible to do prior to registration. \r\n\r\nAny event with 3 or fewer fencers registered AND PAID by the deadline of April 28, 2023 will not be fenced - all registrants will qualify (top 3).  Any event with 4 or more fencers will be fenced and the schedule will be adjusted to reflect appropriate start times after the April 28, 2023 deadline.  Please check start times prior to traveling to the venue. \r\n\r\nAfter April 28th, late registration will begin.  Fees will be increased by $5.  Late registration will be for events that have either less than 3 fencers, and will be limited to those 3 positions AND any event with 4 or more fencers where the event will be fenced.\r\n\r\nThere will be a fence-off for 3rd place for ALL EVENTS that are fenced as by rules we can send only 3 fencers or 25% of the fencers, whichever number is higher.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 04\/06\/2023.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/28\/2023.\r\nLate Registration closes on AskFred.net at midnight on 05\/06\/2023.\r\n\r\nPlease feel free to call with any questions regarding qualification and registration for this event.  Please understand, after regular registration is closed, there may be nothing that we can do to help you with qualification - so please call with questions prior to the April 28, 2023 deadline.  Otherwise, we will help as much as we can.  (407)461-7107\r\n\r\nFAQ:\r\n\r\n1. Do I have to pay for events that we are not going to fence?\r\n  Yes.  The fees are low, and while some events will not be fenced, there are still hours of paperwork required in order to complete the qualification process. If you don't pay for your event, you are not registered and will not be able to qualify.\r\n\r\n2.  What if I don't qualify because I didn't register in time?\r\n  USA Fencing does have a petition process.  There is a steep $100 fee to petition, that is non-refundable.  Your completed petition does not guarantee qualification, but it is the next step. This is the link to the petition:   https:\/\/www.emailmeform.com\/builder\/form\/S5031WRUTcz4Kay\r\n\r\n3.  What if I don't qualify because I didn't place high enough in the qualifier?\r\n  USA Fencing does have a petition process.  There is a steep $100 fee to petition, that is non-refundable.  Your completed petition does not guarantee qualification, but it is the next step. This is the link to the petition:   https:\/\/www.emailmeform.com\/builder\/form\/S5031WRUTcz4Kay\r\n\r\n4.  Are the events really going to start at 6AM on a Sunday morning?\r\n  No.  This is just the most ridiculous time that we are able to put into the software in order to hold a time slot.  We cannot determine what time events will be fenced until we know how many people will be competing.  This is why we close registration a week early.  After the close of regular registration, we will determine the number of events and the most appropriate times for those events to take place.  Emails will be sent to ALL COMPETITORS through AskFRED.net, so please be sure that your email addresses are up to date in askFRED and that you double check the times a could of days before your event.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Winter Garden Fencing Academy","address":"44 S.
