If fewer than 4 show up, the events will be canceled.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $5 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2007-2008 members of the US Fencing Association (or equivalent), and must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1993-1996\r\nUnder-19 -- Born 1989-1995\r\n\r\nNote that since this tournament is after the Junior Olympic Championships, we are now in a new Junior season.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24721,"tournament_id":5407,"tournament":"Philadelphia D and Under Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-02T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":3892,"name":"Arnold Fencing Classic 2008","start_date":"2008-03-02","end_date":"","comments":"5th anniversary of the AFC will feature: Regional Youth Circuit, Open events for Foil, Epee and Sabre, wheelchair fencing and Elite Invitational!

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24722,"tournament_id":5408,"tournament":"Philadelphia  Y14 Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-08T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5155,"name":"Knights of Siena SE-NC Tournament #6","start_date":"2008-03-08","end_date":"2008-03-09","comments":"We are happy to announce our fifth training tournament of the season.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24723,"tournament_id":5409,"tournament":"Philadelphia  Y14\/ Y12 Foil","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":20,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-09T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":24724,"tournament_id":5409,"tournament":"Philadelphia  Y14\/ Y12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-09T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4967,"name":"Aramis Youth Tournament","start_date":"2008-03-09","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2007-11-25","prereg_close":"2008-03-05","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is the last of the Three Musketeers youth challenge events.  \r\n\r\nEVENTS \r\nY10 Mixed Epee 9:00 AM\r\nY10 Mixed Foil 2:30 PM\r\nY10 Mixed Saber 12:00 PM\r\nY12 Mixed Epee 9:00 AM\r\nY12 Mixed Foil 2:30 PM\r\nY12 Mixed Saber 12:00 PM\r\nY14 Mixed Epee 1:30 PM\r\nY14 Mixed Foil 11:00 AM\r\nY14 Mixed Saber 9:00 AM\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 3\/5\/2008.\r\n\r\n* Each event is $10 if pre-registered and $15 at the door. \r\n* Times posted are close of registration.

On March 15, prepare for The Big One.  The most exciting moment of the international fencing season.  Bigger than Worlds.  Bigger than the Olympics.  Bigger than the Beatles and THEY said they were bigger than Jesus.  So.  Well.  You can draw your own conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe Fence-a-Thon.\r\n\r\nIf you've been living in a cave with your eyes shut and your fingers in your ears for the last three years you'll probably STILL know that Fence-a-Thon is a twelve-hour overnight fencing marathon to benefit pancreatic cancer research.  We start at 7pm Saturday March 15 with a sanctioned tournament that should run until around midnight, break for a huge feast, and the start fencing again and run team tournaments, flepee, or just open bouting until 7am - whatever we feel like!  We keep track of bouts and victories and who did what to whom and at the end of the night, tally it all up and hand out some wicked prizes.  Really wicked.  Just ask Jeff.\r\n\r\nThis year, we're running sanctioned tournaments in Men's and Women's Foil, Epee and Sabre.  All events start at 7pm March 15.\r\n\r\nAll competitors will require current BCFA and CFF membership or USFA membership.  \r\n\r\nThe tournament will be held at our usual venue, St Andrew's Regional High School, at 880 McKenzie Avenue.  Directions to the venue will be available at http:\/\/members.shaw.ca\/ccfc directly.  If you need some help carpooling or a ride down, or if you think driving home Sunday is a poor idea and need a place to crash, give me (Anna) a shout at (250) 592-8713 or by email at anna_smith@shaw.ca.  We'll do anything we can to accomodate.\r\n\r\nEntry fees will be $20 at the door.  Because this is a fundraising event, hit up your friends, your family, your archenemies, your dental patients, anybody at all that you can think of who might have a couple extra bucks towards pancreatic cancer research.  This whole thing got rolling a few years ago when the Canadian fencing community lost Christian Vidosa, international referee and all-around crazy basket case.  His efforts helped to build many of the best referees working in Canada today and touched the lives of the entire fencing community.  Things really aren't the same without him.  This whole show is to honour his memory; therefore, one hundred percent of the proceeds will be donated to the BC Cancer Agency.  Our biggest breadwinners will also be handsomely prizishly rewarded!\r\n\r\nPreregistration is available at http:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=5402.  Preregistration is not mandatory but it'll help us figure out how much food to bring along.  Right now we're banking on \"lots\" but might step that up to \"tons\" or even \"moutains\" if the need arises!\r\n\r\nUmmmm I think that's it!  Give me a shout if I spaced on something really vital (I do basically every year) or if you just have any questions and I'll see what I can do to give things a sheen of mudlike clarity.  Or, you know, just to talk.  Did you hear what she said he heard about them?  Because I totally did.\r\n\r\nThanks guys!  I'm really looking forward to having you all out, and hope everyone can make it for the big night.  So go out, raise tons of cash, invite your teammates, challenge your rivals and come stab your friends!\r\n\r\n\r\nAnna","venue":{"name":"St Andrew's Regional High School","address":"880 McKenzie Ave","city":"Victoria","state":"BC","zip":"V8X 3","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":48.468994,"longitude":-123.374008,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":24677,"tournament_id":5402,"tournament":"CCFC Fence-a-Thon","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-15T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":24678,"tournament_id":5402,"tournament":"CCFC Fence-a-Thon","full_name":"Women's Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-15T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":24679,"tournament_id":5402,"tournament":"CCFC Fence-a-Thon","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-15T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":24680,"tournament_id":5402,"tournament":"CCFC Fence-a-Thon","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-15T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":24681,"tournament_id":5402,"tournament":"CCFC Fence-a-Thon","full_name":"Men's Saber","short_name":"MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-15T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":24682,"tournament_id":5402,"tournament":"CCFC Fence-a-Thon","full_name":"Women's Saber","short_name":"WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-15T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5660,"name":"NorCal Division Womens Epee SNQ","start_date":"2008-03-15","end_date":"","comments":"This is the Northern California Division Women's epee Qualifier for the 2008 Summer National tournament in San Jose, CA.
