Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 11AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter. \r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED. $25 per fencer at the door. Credit card payment will incur a $2 surcharge.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We hope that all the working epees are not left handed. We will charge you $15 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. All the weapons will likely fail the shims test so you are more than welcome to repair our club epees for us. Perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2016-2017 season. You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2003 or earlier\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nC & Under Senior Mixed Epee\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/27\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/04\/2016.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"1106 South 15th Street","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","zip":"98405","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.2476436,"longitude":-122.4511347,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":139161,"tournament_id":35151,"tournament":"MTFC C and Under Mixed Epee","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":22,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-05T11:15:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":35675,"name":"2017 Groundhog Open and Youth","start_date":"2017-02-05","end_date":"","comments":"Mixed open 3 weapons, Y12 foil and epee.

Registration can be completed on FRED, and will be subject to approval to ensure residency requirements. Competitors may be drawn from one or more clubs. Clubs may enter as many teams as they wish, however, an individual can only fence on one team. Registration and payment must be completed by February 3rd. Each team must designate a Team Captain (who may or may not be one of the members of the team) who will function also as the official contact person who will receive additional information as appropriate from the league coordinators. Entry of a team and payment of team entry verifies acceptance of the rules and regulations and rulings of the league coordinator. \r\n\r\n<b>Costs<\/b>\r\n<b>The cost for each team entry is $150, payable via check, cash or card at CEFC  or on askFRED by Feb 7th, 2016.<\/b> Entry fees will be used to subsidize end-of-season-awards and referees for the Playoff bouts.

Teams will fence one match with each of the other teams, one as the designated \"Home\" team and one as the designated \"Visiting\" team. Teams will schedule their own matches with each other, and will have until April 19th to compete matches and report results. In the event of 12 or more teams registering, the league coordinator will place the teams into two different geographically-based divisions (the ruling of the league coordinator in this instance is final and not subject to appeal). Home teams are responsible for arranging for and payment of referees for all hosted matches. Matches will be held at a venue designated by the Home team, and at a time agreed upon by both teams. Any matches not completed by April 19th will be scored as a Double Forfeit. \r\n\r\n<i>Playoff Season Competition<\/i>\r\nAfter the completion of Regular Season Competition, teams will be ranked according to win-loss percentage (see League Rules for concerning Forfeits), with ties be broken first by result of head-to-head competition, and second by total indicators. In the event of unbroken ties, the league coordinator will conduct a coin-flip in the presence of representatives from both teams to determine placement. Teams will be seeded into a standard direct elimination tableau, and playoff competition will commence on April 23rd. The higher seeded team will be designated the \"Home\" team and the lower seeded team the \"Visiting.\" In the event geographic Divisions are used, each division will have its own bracket, and will complete the entirety of its bracket including the Division Championships. The League Coordinator reserves the right to adjust the Regular Season of competition if the number of teams is larger than expected. Guidelines for scheduling Playoff rounds will be published later in the season.\r\n\r\nA team may have no more than 2 of its matches scored as a Forfeit in order to participate in Playoff Season Competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>League Rules<\/b>\r\n<i>Match Rules<\/i>\r\nMatches will be conducted as 45-Touch Relay Format, according to the latest version of the USA Fencing Rules of Competition. The Visiting team designates which side of the scoresheet they will fence on (1-3 vs 4-6). Home Teams are responsible for payment (if any) of referees for all matches except for the Championship and Third-Place matches (and Division Championship matches, if required). Matches will be held at a venue designated by the Home team, and at a time agreed upon by both teams. Any matches not completed by April 19th will be scored as a Double Forfeit.\r\n\r\n<i>Team Member Participation<\/i>\r\nThe designated Home Team is responsible for reporting the results of competition using materials that the League Coordinator will make available after team registrations end.\r\n\r\n<i>Injury Substitution<\/i>\r\nSubstitutions during a match will follow standard rules as laid down in the latest version of the USA Fencing Rules of Competition.\r\n\r\nIn the event of a injury that will take a team member out of competition for a significant period of time (as determined by the Team Captain), a team member may be replaced. A team member replaced in this fashion is not eligible to participate in any additional team matches, but may still be eligible for end of season awards. Both the injured team member and the replacement's legs fenced will count together towards participation requirement.\r\n\r\n<i>Forfeitures<\/i>\r\nA Team that fails to present themselves for an arranged competition will score their match as a Forfeit. It will count in the standings as a 0-0 LOSS and may effect playoff eligibility. The opposing team must present conclusive proof to the league coordinator of the arrangement of the match.\r\n\r\nIf the team match is not completed by the end of the Regular Season the match will be scored as a Double Forfeit.\r\n\r\n<b>Awards to be presented<\/b>\r\n<i>Team Champion and Runner-Up.<\/i> Team Champion name and names of members will be inscribed on the Permanent Trophy.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2004-2009) and Senior (2003 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 24 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nWe will hold six of these between August 2016 and February 2017, and the points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462291,"longitude":-97.2377284,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":142969,"tournament_id":36075,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-11T15:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":142970,"tournament_id":36075,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":12,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-11T12:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":142971,"tournament_id":36075,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":12,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-11T18:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":142972,"tournament_id":36075,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-11T14:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":35568,"name":"UW-Rock Winter Open","start_date":"2017-02-11","end_date":"","comments":"Sanctioned Tournament.
