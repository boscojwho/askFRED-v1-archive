Thank you for your cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- PRIZES: ----------\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to the top four fencers of each event.  \r\n\r\n\r\n---------- DIRECTIONS: ----------\r\n\r\nHere is a link showing the location of the Student Union Building in UBC: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/index_detail.php?locat1=790&show=y,n,n,n,n,y\r\n\r\nHere is a map of the UBC campus: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/images\/pdf\/ubcmap.pdf\r\n\r\nHere is a Google map of the campus: http:\/\/maps.google.ca\/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6138+Student+Union+Boulevard,+Vancouver,+BC&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=27.881336,81.738281&ie=UTF8&ll=49.268379,-123.250186&spn=0.006875,0.019956&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=0\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] on the map.\r\n\r\nThere is a parkade north of the SUB called \"North Parkade\" you can park in. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building between the Student Recreation Centre (SRC) and the War Memorial Gym. \r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry or the border after Oak St Bridge:\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive, or\r\nOption B: follow Oak Street all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Avenue - that is the first and only exit on the right close to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights - do not run the red lights, okay?\r\n\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it is a bit far away from the SUB.  IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park. On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $6.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.\r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc@gmail.com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.268139,"longitude":-123.250076,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":59791,"tournament_id":13862,"tournament":"Spring Cleaning Tournament 2011","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-03T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12088,"name":"AFA's April Senior Mixed Epee Tournament","start_date":"2011-04-03","end_date":"","comments":"Limited to 32 Competitors","prereg_open":"2010-07-22","prereg_close":"2011-04-02","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Epee - Close of Registration at 10:00 a.m.\r\n\r\nUSFA Membership is required.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":62359,"tournament_id":14490,"tournament":"Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-03T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14524,"name":"Mt.

It should NOT BE EXPIRED.<br>\r\n<li>Be on time. Don't bother trying to call us... you are either there or you aren't.

If your USFA card and the USFA membership list do not show that you belong to the Metropolitan Division\/Section, we absolutely positively will not let you fence. We don't care where your family lives, where you go to school, what club you occasionally practice at, who your coach is, or who you talked to at the national office... YOU WILL NOT FENCE.<br>\r\n<li>Be of the correct age for the events you are participating in. Age restrictions are listed in the US Fencing Athlete's Handbook (available through the link above). If you are considering attending national championships, you should have already downloaded and read the Athlete's Handbook cover to cover (twice). We will be generous and tell you that age restrictions are covered in section 2.5, titled \"Eligibility to Compete\".\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is no leeway for \"close\" in the age guidelines. If your birthday was December 31st before the minimum year or January 1st after the latest year of the event you want to be in, tough cookies.\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<b>Division 3 Qualification to National Championships<\/b><br>\r\nPlease note that per USFA guidelines there are no Division 3 qualifying events. Qualification for Division 3 events is through qualification in Div 1A, Div 2, U19 or U16 in the same weapon, or by placing in the top 25% of D & Under fencers in the Division 2 qualifying event that don't otherwise qualify. Therefore if you want to qualify for Division 3 events, it is recommended that you enter the Division 2 qualifying event in the same weapon. If this is unclear to you, please read the Athlete's Handbook.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Notes<\/b><br>\r\n<ul><li>We cannot stress enough that we STRONGLY recommend that all fencers interested in attending national championships read the Athlete's Handbook, with a special focus on chapter 2. Especially 2.5 (Eligibility to Compete); 2.7 (What is a Qualifier); 2.8 (Appeal\/Petition Process); and 2.11 (Specific Events). We also recommend that you know, by heart, the qualifying paths for any events you want to fence in at nationals.<br>&nbsp;<br><li>You MUST show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and WILL NOT be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration.<br>&nbsp;<br><li>BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n<\/ul><br>As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse. We will be highly unsympathetic towards any excuses short of natural disaster, war and\/or death (and for those at war, you technically belong to the National Division, so even that won't work!).\r\n\r\n<b>Location<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe New York Athletic Club is located at 180 Central Park South, in Manhattan.

The events will alternate between foil and epee.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments are designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer. There are four tournaments per weapon. There will be a point system for Epee and Foil. Awards will be given to the top three fencers in the points standings at the last tournaments (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). The points system is described below.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events.

The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they are pre-qualified as described below.)\r\n\r\nThere no longer is a Cadet(U16) qualifier for Summer Nationals.  Starting this season, the U16 events at Summer Nationals are technically NAC events and all age-eligibile fencers can attend.\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  All fencers must be US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\nIf you have already qualified for Div II\/III\/Y14 through another means (see below), you can still attend this event.  You won't \"take up\" a qualification since you are already qualified - instead, you'll help the numbers but will be skipped when awarding qualifications.  \r\n\r\n\r\n---- Am I Pre-Qualified? ----\r\nThe majority of fencers in the division are NOT pre-qualified and will need to fence this event.  However...  \r\n\r\nYou are pre-qualified for Div III and\/or Div II if you qualified for Division I-A at a Div I-A ROC this season (such as the Battle in Seattle or Columbia Int'l.)\r\n\r\nYou are pre-qualified for Y14 if any of the following applies:\r\n\r\n1. You earned Y14 points at a SYC this season\r\n2. You have Y14 points as of April 9, 2011\r\n3. You placed FIRST in an RYC Y14 event this season (first place only - NOT first in each gender.)\r\n\r\nConfused, or not sure if you're pre-qualified?  ASK YOUR COACH!  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule -----\r\nSaturday at 10:00 am\r\n-- Div II\/III Men's Foil\r\n-- Div II\/III Women's Epee\r\n-- Y14 Men's Epee\r\nSaturday at Noon (see note below)\r\n-- Div II\/III Women's Saber\r\n-- Y14 Women's Saber \r\nSaturday at 1:00 pm\r\n-- Div II\/III Men's Saber\r\n-- Div II\/III Women's Foil\r\n\r\nSunday at 10:00 am\r\n-- Div II\/III Men's Epee\r\n-- Y14 Men's Saber\r\n-- Y14 Women's Epee\r\nSunday at 1:00 pm\r\n-- Y14 Women's Foil\r\n-- Y14 Men's Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nIf there are any women fencing both the Y14 and Div II\/III saber events, we will delay one of these events if necessary so that they can participate in both.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe entry fee is a flat $20 per event.  \r\n\r\nRegistration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm PDT on Wednesday April 6th.  If you do not register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nPre-payment of event fees on AskFRED is encouraged, but not required.  We will accept cash or checks (made to \"WWD\") at the door.  We DO NOT accept credit or debit cards.   \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=14374\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nALL events will be run as two rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.  The combined results from the two pool rounds will be used to seed the DE tableau.  Depending on how many fencers attend, we may do a cut after the second round of pools. \r\n\r\nThis two-rounds-of-pools format has proven to be popular with the fencers since it gives everyone a lot of fencing.  It also tends to \"smooth out\" the seeding - if you fence poorly in the first round of pools, you can redeem yourself by fencing well in the second round.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks.
