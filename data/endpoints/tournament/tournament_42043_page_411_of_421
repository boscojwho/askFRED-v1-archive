Current US Fencing Membership is not required to participate, but AskFred seems to require a membership number in order to preregister.   \r\n\r\nAll US Fencing rules regarding equipment and safety will be strictly enforced, except for names on uniforms. Fencers presenting non-conforming weapons and cords will receive appropriate penalties. \r\n\r\nWe are planning a 3-weapon mixed event in the morning and then a 3-weapon mixed team event. For the purposes of this event, a mixed team is made up of three people and includes at least one male and one female fencer. The third team member may identify as any gender. To eliminate issues with substitutions and alternates, we are asking teams to cap at three. \r\n\r\nDue to time and space constraints, we are asking athletes to register for a max of two events. Choose a second weapon, or choose to join a team. \r\n\r\nPlease check back for more information on check-in times. We hope to start individual events as early as 10 am. \r\n\r\nSome pools will likely be self-reffed. But really, can anyone think of a  any better way for us all to get to know each other. :-)\r\n\r\nRegistration\r\nPlease register on FRED in advance of the event. Those wishing to register the day of will be charged $10 extra. Registration doesn't close until 2\/18\/23. There are no excuses for not signing up!\r\n\r\nFees\r\nEvents are $25\/each, payable by cash or check at the door. Teams are $75 each.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil: Registration closes at 10 am. \r\nMixed Epee: Registration closes at 10 am. \r\nMixed Saber: Registration closes at 12 pm.\r\nMixed Teams: Registration closes at 2 pm. \r\nWe aim to start all events as soon as possible following the close of registration. Team events should start by 2:30 pm.  \r\n\r\nLocation and Parking\r\nThe Open will be held in the UCSB Robertson Gym, Main Floor.  Parking is available in Lot 16 and is $4 for the day.

This is a two-weapon tournament, in which fencers fight in the round, using any epee-bladed weapon and any reasonable off-hand weapon.\r\n\r\nPlease see the links below for rules and pre-registration! The rules for this tournament are rather different from other tournaments in which you may have fenced, so please be sure to read them thoroughly. Also, pre-registration allows us more time to fence, so please sign up ahead of time if at all possible!\r\n\r\nTo anticipate some of the more common questions:\r\n\r\nEach day is a separate competition, so you may fence on Saturday, Sunday, or both.\r\n\r\nThe registration fee is $15 per day, and includes two complimentary tickets to the Festival.\r\n\r\nThis is a dry tournament - no electric equipment needed!\r\n\r\nSome examples of off-hand weapons that have been used in the past include: Dagger, cloak, buckler, hat, and (non-breakable!) mug. You are not limited to these, however! If you have an idea for a second weapon you want to use, present it to the tournament director for approval on the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nPointes-d'arret are acceptable, but not required.\r\n\r\nAfter the tournament is over, we have the space for open fencing, so stick around! This is a great opportunity to fence people you might not ordinarily come in contact with, and play with different styles and varieties of swordplay.\r\n\r\nRules: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1s9WSMnWt-Hh9H91wltNP39fWg6YlOmeDU-Y14OpG4uQ\/edit?fbclid=IwAR2muO5ji9lrPYsvGrfqFuowHj3H_iAD0FGZZtxXZtNsvwc6aJ1oMTk-KLU\r\n\r\nRegistration Form: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSdx7gs3hxvQocbKjDwD-1WVzKnHrd3SEmZoyDnZbUexXyOkjA\/viewform\r\n\r\nLink to event of Facebook:\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/events\/505624898345543\/505624908345542\/?active_tab=about","venue":{"name":"Bay Area Renaissance Festival","address":"12838 Auton Rd Dade City, FL 33525","city":"Dade City","state":"FL","zip":"33525","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.3443195,"longitude":-82.1282864,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":204441,"tournament_id":52596,"tournament":"14th Imperial Fenicng Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dagger and Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":18,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"Dagger and","close_of_reg":"2023-03-04T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":204442,"tournament_id":52596,"tournament":"14th Imperial Fenicng Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dagger and Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":11,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"Dagger and","close_of_reg":"2023-03-05T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":52861,"name":"FAP-NORTH  Unclassified Foil","start_date":"2023-03-04","end_date":"","comments":"Pre registered entry is $50 at check in, CASH ONLY.

Here are some of the specs:\r\n\r\nPLASTRON: worn on the weapon arm side\r\n\r\nGLOVE: that covers approximately half the forearm\r\n\r\nLONG SOCKS: that come up past the edge of the knickers.\r\n\r\nJACKET & KNICKERS: must be correctly fitting, covering all approprate skin and undershirts, and be the correct handedness (ask your coach if you are unsure!)\r\n \r\n CHEST PLATE: Required for girls; optional for boys.\r\n\r\nArrival: the venue opens one hour before the first close of check in for the day, athletes should arrive no later than one hour before their close of check in so they have time to prepare for event start. Events will start as close to the close of check-in as possible.\r\n\r\nParking: please park in the Glenside parking lot and enter through the Wyncote Commons lobby and come up the stairs to your left or take the elevator.\r\n\r\nInfectious disease: Plese stay home if you have had contact with anyone known or suspected to have Covid-19.
