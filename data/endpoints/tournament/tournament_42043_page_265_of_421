Our goal is to create a positive tournament experience and setting for every fencer, while providing a level of professionalism expected of an elite fencing center.\r\n\r\nThe SFSFL incorporates two Circuits within its infrastructure, The Junior & Open Circuit (JOC) and The Individual Challenge Circuit (ICC).  The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.  These ranking systems mirror that of the National Governing Body, USA Fencing, and the International Governing Body, Federation International de\u0092 Escrime (FIE).  Each tournament in the JOC will award fencers in the final four with medals.  Each tournament in the ICC will award the final eight fencers with medals.

Schedule will be updated as more teams join, and can be found here: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/spreadsheets\/d\/1L9Ef3JTQrvERmSFppKaw2Nvn_OEX4LfUC_oMglF6nSg\/edit#gid=0\r\n\r\nThe format follows the standard NCAA dual meet format, with a round robin. Each match is won by a majority of 5 point bouts, but all 9 bouts will be fenced. If there are 4 or fewer teams in an event, there will be a second round of pools with a 45 pt relay instead.\r\n\r\nFor any questions or team changes, please email fencing@rit.edu.\r\n\r\nLong pants are required, but jeans are not allowed. Plastrons are also required. Foil bibs are not required.\r\n\r\nIf you have any extra fencers, or not enough for a team, email fencing@rit.edu, and we can probably put together a mixed team.\r\n\r\nSean T. Horan founded the RIT Fencing Club in 2001 with the assistance of Dr. Carl Lutzer. Fencing for almost 20 years, Sean has coached students to national medals in all three weapons, as well as international sabre competitions. Passionate about a positive club community and mathematics, Sean's establishment of RITFC almost 15 years ago has allowed for countless students to discover fencing. We look forward to seeing you, at the 1st Annual Sean T. Horan Team Invitational.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Team Epee\r\nMixed Team Foil\r\nMixed Team Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/23\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/12\/2016.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"RIT Clark Gym","address":"1 Lomb Memorial Drive","city":"Rochester","state":"NY","zip":"14623","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":43.0860001,"longitude":-77.6745371,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":45,"name":"Western New York","abbrev":"WNY","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":129889,"tournament_id":32928,"tournament":"Sean T.
