If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.

If you were going to come you should have signed up!  Oh well.  Come anyway and fence Y14, ok?<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe will run the Mixed Random Draw Team Epee if people still want to fence some more.  It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  Y12 fencers can fence in the team event if they have at least an E rating.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  If we have a lot of people signed up we may use some imagination in the format; last year, for example, we ran a pool of teams, each round to a multiple of 3 rather than 5, each round to a max of 1 minute rather than 3.  At any rate, it will be a lot of fencing but will not go on until midnight.  \r\n\r\nIt's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gulfcoastfencing.org\/GCwaiverconsent.pdf\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it's about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.  After you cross the railroad tracks look for the college on the left.  Depending on where in Houston you're coming from it's about an hour drive.  There is considerable construction going on on campus, but we'll have some signs up to direct you to the gym.\r\n\r\nIf you have a GPS, plug in \"500 College Dr., Lake Jackson, TX, 77566\".\r\n\r\nMap:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/tinyurl.com\/bcfal\r\n\r\nIf you get lost call me on my cell - 979 848 7433\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brazosport College, Lake Jackson TX","address":"","city":"Lake Jackson","state":"TX","zip":"77566","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":56615,"tournament_id":13378,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-27T12:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":56618,"tournament_id":13378,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-27T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":56621,"tournament_id":13378,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-27T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":59025,"tournament_id":13378,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed Random Draw Team Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"Random Draw Team","close_of_reg":"2010-11-27T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13401,"name":"Hawaii Division Open Epee\/Sabre #2","start_date":"2010-11-27","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-10-23","prereg_close":"2010-11-26","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Ala Wai Golf Course","address":"","city":"Waikiki","state":"HI","zip":"96744","country":"USA","timezone":"Pacific\/Honolulu","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":15,"name":"Hawaii","abbrev":"HI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":56812,"tournament_id":13401,"tournament":"Hawaii Division Open Epee\/Sabre #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-27T08:30:00-10:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":56813,"tournament_id":13401,"tournament":"Hawaii Division Open Epee\/Sabre #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-11-27T11:30:00-10:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":13427,"name":"Black Friday Youth Open","start_date":"2010-11-27","end_date":"2010-11-28","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-10-27","prereg_close":"2010-11-26","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nY12 Mixed Epee\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\r\nY14 Mixed Epee\r\nY14 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/27\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/26\/2010.\r\n\r\nJoin us for a grand continuation of Black Friday festivities.

The events will alternate between foil and epee.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments are designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer. There are four tournaments per weapon. There will be a point system for Epee and Foil. Awards will be given to the top three fencers in the points standings at the last tournaments (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). The points system is described below.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events. Tournament cost is $10.00 if you preregister on AskFRED. $15.00 to register at the door.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1) Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments. Awards will be given out at the last tournament of each weapon (Senior Circuit #7 & #8).
