As such, All our proceeds will go to the Whatcom Humane Society who is trying to build a new building. Fencers are encouraged to collect pledges for each touch scored. Typical Pledges are $1 per touch up to $10 per touch. Flat donations are also welcome! \r\n\r\nPledge Sheets will be sent with Preregistration confirmation email.

We will only be requiring Gloves, Jackets, and Helmets. Also, We have enough equipment in all three weapons to loan out that you need not worry about not having the equipment for some of the events. \r\n\r\nThere will be a costume contest for the best-dressed pirate, so ling as you have the required fencing gear (underneath or on top) you can pretty much wear what you want! There will be a prize for the best pirate!\r\n\r\nWhat the heck is balloon fencing anyways? \r\n\r\nBalloon fencing is where each fencer has 3 balloons taped to various places on their body, and score points by popping the opposing fencers balloons. As this is the only way to score a touch, judging will be minimal and halts infrequent. \r\n\r\nAnd Dry Fencing?\r\n\r\nDry fencing, is fencing without electrical equipment. There will be one Head judge per bout and two touch judges per fencer. A more detailed description of the rules will be gone over at the tournament. Those who cannot afford electrical equipment (most of our club) will be able to compete in the tournament.\r\n\r\nPrizes!\r\n\r\nWill we be awarding prizes for most pledges\/donations, best pirate, top fencers, most touches given and received and more!\r\n\r\nFor more info:\r\nemail us, or check out our website:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ac.wwu.edu\/~fencing\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\n\r\nTournament: WWU Dread Pirates Benefit\r\nDate(s): 05\/13\/2006\r\nLocation: Western Washington University Carver Gym D\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent | Date | Registration Closes\r\nMixed Non-Rated Balloon Epee | Sat 5\/13 | 1:00 PM\r\nMixed Non-Rated \"dry\" Foil | Sat 5\/13 | 9:00 AM\r\nMixed Non-Rated Balloon Saber | Sat 5\/13 | 1:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=1978\r\nPreregistation closes on 05\/12\/2006\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Additionally,\r\nthe League will allow high school junior varsity fencing team members to\r\nexperience the thrill of competition, varsity fencing team members to prepare\r\nfor the upcoming season, and allow all fencers to become thoroughly apprised of\r\nthe rules, regulations, and format of competitive team fencing.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<b><i>Team Composition<\/i><\/b>\r\nThe Morris Fencing League shall have a division for men\r\nteams and a separate division for women teams. If there are not enough teams\r\nbetween the two divisions to meet the minimum total team requirement, a single\r\ndivision of mixed male\/female teams will be created. A mixed team will consist\r\nof either two men and one woman or two women and one man. Each team shall\r\ndesignate a captain. The team captain will be responsible for communicating\r\nwith the league bout committee regarding match results, fencer substitutions,\r\nbout discrepancies and all other matters concerning the conduct of the fencing\r\nmatches.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nEach team consists of a minimum of three fencers, with the option of a fourth fencer\r\ndesignated as the substitute. One team will be designated the <b><i>Home<\/i><\/b>\r\nteam and the opposing team will be designated the <b><i>Away<\/i><\/b> team. The\r\nfencers on Home team in a match are numbered 1-3; the opposing Away team\r\nfencers are numbered 4-6. Each slot on a team competes against the three\r\nopposing slots (9 bouts).\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<b><i>Relay format<\/i><\/b>\r\nIndividual team fencing bouts will follow the <b><i>Relay<\/i><\/b>\r\nformat. The Relay format may at first seen complex and complicated, however\r\nthis format will make every bout of the 9 bout team match significant and a\r\nteam winner may not necessarily be determined after only 5 bouts. The relays\r\nare run to multiples of five touches (5-10-15-20, etc.); the maximum time for\r\neach relay is four minutes.\r\n<ul style='margin-top:0in' type=disc>\r\n <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>The first two opponents fence until one has reached a\r\n     score of five touches, within the maximum time of four minutes. The\r\n     following two opponents fence until one has scored ten touches, within the\r\n     maximum time of four minutes, and so forth with successive relays to\r\n     multiples of five touches.<\/li>\r\n <li class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'>If, at the end of four minutes, the appropriate score\r\n     for a relay has not been reached, the next two fencers continue from the\r\n     existing score and fence until the appropriate score for their relay is\r\n     reached, within a maximum of four minutes. (Example: in the second relay,\r\n     the score is 8-6 when time expires. The third relay begins with a score of\r\n     8-6, and continues until one of the teams has a total score of 15 touches,\r\n     or four minutes elapses.)<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<b><i>&nbsp;<\/i><\/b>\r\n<b><i>Determining the Victor<\/i><\/b>\r\nThe winning team is the one that first scores 45 touches (9\r\nx 5 touches), or that has scored more touches at the end of regulation time. In\r\nthe case of a tied score at the end of regulation time for the final relay, an\r\nadditional minute of fencing will be allowed, to a single decisive touch. This\r\ndecisive touch will be fenced by the final two fencers. Before restarting the\r\nteam match, the referee will flip a coin to determine the winner should the\r\nscore remain tied at the end of the additional minute, and <i>will note this\r\npriority on the score sheet<\/i>. If a fencer and the possible substitute are\r\nforced to withdraw, or if a fencer is excluded, that team has lost the team\r\nmatch.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<b><i>The Season Schedule<\/i><\/b>\r\nThe Morris Fencing League\u0092s Spring season will be approximately 8 weeks long which will\r\ninclude 6 weeks of team pool matches and two weeks of direct eliminations\r\n(DEs).\u00a0 Depending on the total number of teams, all teams will be promoted into\r\nthe DEs with the highest ranked teams possibly receiving first round byes. The\r\nSpring season will begin approximately the first week of May and end by the\r\nlast week of June.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nEach team will fence an opposing team twice within a season. The team designated the Home\r\nteam during the first meeting will be designated the Away team at the second\r\nmeeting. The team designated the Away team during the first meeting will be\r\ndesignated the Home team during the second meeting.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTeam matches will take place one evening each week with each weapon competition held\r\non a specific night.\u00a0 All teams of a specific weapon will assemble on their\r\ndesignated evening and fence 2 opposing teams each evening. All team matches: will\r\nbegin at 7:00pm and conclude by 9:00pm.\r\n&nbsp;\r\nTrophies and awards will be bestowed upon the top three finishers within each weapon, as\r\nwell as, recognitions for individual fencers (i.e.;

The fencing season is the same as the membership year, August 1 through the following July 31.\r\n\r\nThe only exception to this rule is that an athlete under the age of 13 on January 1 of the fencing season, who is on the Junior national point standings, will be allowed to complete in any competition as long as the athlete meets any other criteria required for that competition, e.g., holding a certain classification.\r\n\r\nThe Birmingham Fencing Club will strictly enforce this rule at all tournaments\r\n\r\nCost: $25 for the first event\r\n$10 for each additional event\r\n$15 late fee for registrations received at the door\r\n\r\nAll \"A\" rated fencers fence for free in all events!\r\n\r\nAll \"B\" rated fencers will receive a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nVenue: Birmingham Fencing Club\r\n1425 Montgomery Highway (Highway 31), Suite 25\r\nBirmingham, Alabama 35216\r\n205-823-4448\r\n\r\nAwards: Through 3rd place, as well as to the top 3 placing women\r\n\r\n-USFA rules apply.

You MUST wear a plastron, and NO SWEATPANTS will be permitted in competition.\r\n\r\nPre-registration is important! This tournament is being held in a facility with room for only a limited number of strips, and it may become necessary to limit the number of entries in particular events.
