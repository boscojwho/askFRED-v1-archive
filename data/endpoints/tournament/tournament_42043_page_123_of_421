Howard has been coaching fencing for over 30 years and is currently Head Coach Emeritus at ACFA. He is certified by the United States Fencing Coaches Association and the Academie d' Armes Internationale as a Moniteur D' Escrime in foil, epee, and sabre. Coach Howard was initially trained by his maternal grandfather, Mr. T. E. Anderson, who was a student of Ralph Faulkner at the Falcon Studios in the late 1920's and early 1930's. As a young teenager, Coach Howard's grandfather placed him under the tutelage of Maestro Nick Toth in Colorado Springs in 1960. Coach Howard has helped develop the talent of numerous fencers, producing nationally ranked fencers and a national champion. Coach Howard is retired from Amarillo College where he taught biology for many years. He still serves as the curator of the AC Natural History Museum. He also is a concert pianist and has composed a suite for piano called \"Prairie Visions,\" which was professionally recorded and is available in CD. Over the last few years, Coach Howard has been fighting Parkinson's disease. All the proceeds from this tournament will go toward a special fund to help Coach Howard with his ongoing medical bills and his fight against this terrible disease.\r\n\r\nDATE\r\nApril 30 - May 1, 2011\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\nAmarillo College\r\nCarter Fitness Center\r\nCorner of 24th Street & Washington\r\nAmarillo, TX 79109\r\n\r\nBOUT COMMITTEE\r\nThe Bout Committee will be chaired by Gerrie Baumgart.\r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED\r\nSATURDAY APRIL\u00a030th\r\n\r\n9:00 am\r\nY14 Mixed Foil\r\nSenior Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n12:00 pm\r\nY10 & Y12 Mixed Foil\r\nJunior (U20) Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nSUNDAY MAY 1st\r\n9:00 am\r\nY14 Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n12:00 pm\r\nY10 & Y12 Mixed Epee\r\nJunior (U20) Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n12:15 pm\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION & EVENT FEES\r\nRegistration $10\r\nSenior events $20\r\nJunior events $15\r\nYouth events $10\r\n\r\nALL fencers who are NOT pre-registered on Ask Fred by April 23, 2011 will be assessed a $5 LATE REGISTRATION FEE for each event in which they are not pre-registered.\r\n\r\nUSFA RULES\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced in the tournament.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":64281,"tournament_id":15036,"tournament":"Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-08T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14800,"name":"Youth & Cadet Epee ","start_date":"2011-05-08","end_date":"","comments":"We are located within walking distance of Absolute Fencing Gear!

The events will alternate between foil and epee.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments are designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer. There are four tournaments per weapon. There will be a point system for Epee and Foil. Awards will be given to the top three fencers in the points standings at the last tournaments (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). The points system is described below.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events. Tournament cost is $10.00 if you preregister on AskFRED. $15.00 to register at the door.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1) Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments. Awards will be given out at the last tournament of each weapon (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). If fencers, for whatever reason, cannot attend, prizes will be held for them at NWFC.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Senior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/08\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/11\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Ave","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.4841092,"longitude":-122.7827255,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":54113,"tournament_id":12736,"tournament":"Senior Circuit #8","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-12T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14857,"name":"May Friday Night Fight Night","start_date":"2011-05-13","end_date":"","comments":"Westdale Fencing Club is pleased to announce a monthly series of 'Just For Fun' bouting opportunities.\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2011-04-04","prereg_close":"2011-05-12","authority":"CFF","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Westdale Fencing Club is pleased to announce the first in a monthly series of 'Just For Fun' bouting opportunities.\r\n\r\nThis is not a formal competition, but rather an opportunity to fence with some new faces and hone competitive skills in an environment that is more competitive than regular 'club' fencing, but without the stresses of formal comeptition.
