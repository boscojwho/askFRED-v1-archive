If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster

For the 5th year in a row, FCA has hosted it's now famous Novice tournament and Spaghetti feed.\r\n\r\nThis tournament is specifically designed for new students to the sport of fencing. All fencers who have never been rated. Ask your coach about USFA ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is not a USFA event so fencers are not required to have full uniforms. They will be required to have a mask, glove, underarm protector which can be barrowed from their club. FCA fencers get priority for use of FCA gear. It is strongly encouraged that those fencers who plan on continuing on in fencing purchase their own gear in preparation for this tournament. Finally all epee fencers will wear sweats that are not \"hip huggers\" and cover their entire legs.\r\n\r\nAlong with this now traditional tournament is a spaghetti feed which features the VERY famous Wayne Spaghetti sauce. Fencers are encouraged to bring their own dish such as salad or desert. FCA will provide Spaghetti noodles, sauce, plates, napkins, cups, utinsils and milk. \r\n\r\nNormally with our semi-anual tournament we also have a spaghetti feed, but in light of the summer months and the never ending sun we thought a barbque was more appropriate. Please bring your own drinks. We will provide hamburgers\/hot dogs, buns and condiments. Contact Jacquie to sign up for other items to bring.\r\n\r\nThere is a $15\/event fee to participate.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled: \r\nCheck in for Foil CLOSES 9:30A\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nCheck in for Epee CLOSES 11:30A\r\nSenior Mixed Epee\r\nY12 Mixed Epee \r\n\r\nCheck in opens at 9:00A and closes by 9:30A for Foil. The Epee events will open at 11:00A and close by 11:30A. Fencers who arrive after the close of check in for their event will not be allowed to fence.\r\n\r\nThe senior & Y12 events for each weapon will be held simultaneously depending on the size of the events. If one event is large then the smaller of the two will be postponed until strips become available. All fencers should have snacks and\/or lunch available since we will NOT break for lunch.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/05\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/22\/2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Center of Alaska","address":"2602 Gambell St","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","zip":"99503","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Anchorage","latitude":61.196625,"longitude":-149.870616,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":13,"name":"Alaska","abbrev":"AK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":23610,"tournament_id":5152,"tournament":"2008 FCA Summer Novice Tournament","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-07-20T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":23611,"tournament_id":5152,"tournament":"2008 FCA Summer Novice Tournament","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-07-19T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":23612,"tournament_id":5152,"tournament":"2008 FCA Summer Novice Tournament","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-07-20T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":23613,"tournament_id":5152,"tournament":"2008 FCA Summer Novice Tournament","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-07-19T11:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":25484,"tournament_id":5152,"tournament":"2008 FCA Summer Novice Tournament","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-07-19T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6218,"name":"Nevada Division Championships","start_date":"2008-07-19","end_date":"2008-07-20","comments":"The Nevada Division Championships is an open tournament for anyone 13 years and older that is a Nevada Division member.
