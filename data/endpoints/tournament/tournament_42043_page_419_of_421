NO EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE FOR LATE ENTRY. Please, DO NOT email me with your reason for not registering on time. The answer will not be any different than what is stated here. Your inability to register on time is not my problem. Register early to avoid any issues. Registration without complete payment does not mean you are entered. Register AND COMPLETE PAYMENT before the stated deadlines.\r\n\r\n2. NO WALKINS WILL BE ALLOWED - only preregistered and PAID competitors may fence. \r\n\r\n3. US fencers - you must be current ACCESS or COMPETITIVE MEMBERS of USFA. There are no day memberships and noncompetitive memberships are ineligible. Collegiate members MUST be on their U.S. college\/university official roster. \r\n\r\n4 FOREIGN athletes. We welcome your participation at the PdT; however, you must be a current international member of USFA to compete. Please go to the usafencing.org website\/membership to obtain your international USFA membership. This includes our friends from Canada. \r\n\r\n5. Any FOREIGN national with a world ranking within the last 5 years, at any level, is not allowed to fence in the E and under. No entries will be refunded for any ineligible fencer registering for this event. We will take your money and not give it back.\r\n\r\n6. National point standings DO NOT APPLY at this tournament. If you are underage, you may not participate. See eligibility below.  \r\n\r\n7. BLUE GAUNTLET will be on site for equipment needs. \r\n\r\n8. Medals and potato specific prizes (PSPs) are awarded to top 8 in individual events. If you are unable to stay for the award presentation, you must have someone pick up the medal. No awards will be given out before the presentation. \r\n\r\nFORMAT: Vet and E and Under are 100% promotion from pools to Direct Elimination. Opens are 80% promotion from pools to Direct Elimination. Seeding is by classification only; national point standings are not used. \r\nCurrently, there are no capacity limits; however, we reserve the right to make changes should an epidemic or some other event beyond our control occur. \r\n\r\nREMINDER: Event Restrictions: You may fence in only one individual event per day (exception if also qualified for a Vet event). If you are in two events on the same day, (Vet and individual) you MUST present yourself at the appropriate strip when called. If you register for multiple events on the same day (i.e., different weapons) you will be removed from one and there will be no refund. \r\n\r\nELIGIBILITY\r\n\r\nBirth year 2009 or earlier. In any tournament where children can fence with adults, the fencer must be 13 BEFORE January 1 of the competition season (August - July) i.e., competitor must have turned 13 by Dec 31, 2022.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be a current access or competitive member of the USFA by June 15. Memberships will be checked before the event; if you are not compliant you will receive an email requiring you to join\/renew and bring proof of current membership. No event will be held up because you are not a USFA member at check in. \r\n\r\nCheck in WILL require current USA fencing membership card to be scanned. Printed copy is best option.

Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nAll events are for fencers born in 2009 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. D & Under events are for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2022-2023) USA Fencing membership. A Competitive or Access membership is sufficient. Please join or renew your membership online at https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/. \r\n\r\nAll fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use an FIE-approved padded protector. We have a limited quantity of the padded protectors available for sale or rental. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $30 per fencer. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=51434\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/23\/2023\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":200121,"tournament_id":51434,"tournament":"2022-2023 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney","full_name":"Senior Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"SrMxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-06-25T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":200123,"tournament_id":51434,"tournament":"2022-2023 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney","full_name":"Senior Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"SrMxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-06-24T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":53484,"name":"EFC Summer Solstice Challenge","start_date":"2023-06-24","end_date":"2023-06-25","comments":"Come join us for EFC's Summer Solstice Challenge! \r\nLast chance to compete before Summer Nationals and earn your rating for Senior Events!\r\n\r\nNo registration fees, $50 per event.","prereg_open":"2023-05-11","prereg_close":"2023-06-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Come join us for EFC's <b>Summer Solstice Challenge<\/b>!\r\nLast chance to compete before Summer Nationals and earn your rating for Senior Events!\r\nNo registration fees, $50 per event.\r\n\r\n<b>LOCATION<\/b>: ENFIELD FENCING CLUB | 54 Hazard Ave, Unit 20, Enfield, CT 06082.\r\nWe are located in the Enfield Stop & Shop Plaza, just minutes off of I-91 Exit 47E, in the corner location of the Plaza right next to the grocery store. \r\nAmple parking available in the back parking lot.\r\nSeveral food options available within the Plaza and surrounding areas.\r\n\r\n<b>IMPORTANT<\/b>: All events are capped at 18 participants.
