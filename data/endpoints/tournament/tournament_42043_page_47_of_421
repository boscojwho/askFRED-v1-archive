There will youth foil and sabre events, plus Under-19 events in all three weapons.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth\/U19 #4 (07-08)\r\nDate(s): 04\/05\/2008 - 04\/06\/2008\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nSaturday, April 5th\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y8, Y12 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y10 Foil, U19 Epee\r\n\r\nSunday, April 6th\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - U19 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM Y10\/12, U19 Sabre\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nFor the sabre events on Sunday, we require a minimum of four fencers per event to hold it. If fewer than 4 show up, the events will be canceled.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $5 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2007-2008 members of the US Fencing Association (or equivalent), and must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1993-1996\r\nUnder-19 -- Born 1989-1995\r\n\r\nNote that since this tournament is after the Junior Olympic Championships, we are now in a new Junior season. Fencers born in 1995 are eligible for the U19 events.\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=5659\r\nPreregistation closes on 04\/04\/2008\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event unless they have sufficient national points to auto-qualify. \r\n\r\n<i>This tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.<\/i>\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>----- Qualification Info -----<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe only way to qualify for Division II and III is to fence in the Div II\/III (C & under) event.  In prior years, qualifying for Under-16 automatically qualified you for Div II\/III.  <b><i>THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.<\/i><\/b>  Also, please note that you can <B><i>NOT<\/i><\/b> qualify for Division II or III at Sectionals in May.  If you fail to qualify for Div II or III at this event, there <b><i>IS NO SECOND CHANCE.<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it may not be fenced (and no fee will be charged) since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>----- Event Schedule -----<\/b>\r\n\r\n---- Thursday 4\/10\/08 ----\r\n<i>At SALLE AURIOL SEATTLE<\/i>\r\n7:00 pm\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Saber\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Saber\r\n \r\n---- Friday 4\/11\/08 ----\r\n<i>At RAIN CITY FENCING CENTER<\/i>\r\n7:00 pm\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Foil\r\n\r\n---- Saturday 4\/12\/08 ----\r\n<i>At SALLE AURIOL SEATTLE<\/i>\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Epee\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Foil\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Foil\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Foil\r\n\r\n---- Sunday 4\/13\/08 ----\r\n<i>At SALLE AURIOL SEATTLE<\/i>\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Foil\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Epee\r\n12:00 Noon\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Epee\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Epee\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Epee\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.  Fencers may enter multiple events per day, but they may be required to fence in both events simultaneously if necessary.  We will do our best to accomodate these fencers within the limits of the schedule.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that many of the Y-14 and U-16 events will be very small and either not be fenced at all (if 3 or fewer fencers show) or finish quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>----- Registration Information -----<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe registration fee is $10 plus $10 per event entered.  Tournament fees can be pre-paid online on AskFRED when you register, or by cash or check on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFRED is <b>REQUIRED<\/b> by 11:59pm on Sunday April 6th.

If you're on the list, you're already qualified!\r\n\r\n*\"C\" & Under event\r\n-------------------\r\nOpen only to fencers rated \"C\" and below.\r\nTop 3 or 25% rounded up finishers qualify for the Division II Summer Nationals. \r\nTop 3 or 25% rounded up rated \"D\" and below will qualify for Division III Summer Nationals. \r\n\r\nAll veteran competitors qualify for Veteran events at Summer Nationals \r\nFencers must be born 1994 or earlier, or be on the current Junior point list to compete. \r\n \r\nThere will be no separate D3 (\"D\" and below) competition, as it would no longer result in any extra qualifiers. Qualification for D3 will be solely through the \"C & Under\" event. \r\n\r\n**Under 16\r\n-----------\r\nOpen only to fencers who were born 1992 or later. Note that according to the USFA, if you were born after 1995 you will have to have Y14 points to qualify to fence in the U16 event at Nationals even if you were to have finished high enough to qualify in this tournament. Fencers on the Cadet point list automatically qualify. Fencers who qualified for the U19 event at Sectionals now automatically qualify for the Cadet event \r\nTop 3 or 25% qualify for Under 16 Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\n**Youth-14\r\n-----------\r\nOpen only to fencers who were born 1993 or later. Note that according to the USFA, if you were born after 1996 you will have to have Y12 points to qualify to fence in the Y14 event at Nationals even if you qualify based on this tournament. Fencers on the Y14 list automatically qualify. \r\nTop 3 or 25% qualify for Youth-14 Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nTo qualify for the Youth12 and Youth10 categories this year you must be either on the appropriate point list, or have competed in a regional or super-regional youth tournament. The list of such tournaments is given on the www.usfencing.org website.\r\n\r\nThe complete rules for qualifying to national tournaments are located on the www.usfencing.org website (the athlete's handbook), and a summary is located here. \r\n\r\nTeam Events\r\n-------------\r\nClose of registration for U-19 and Senior team events for Summer National Championships is the same time as for the \"C\" and under event. Indiana has never sent more than two teams per weapon to Nationals. We can qualify four teams. Clubs wishing to qualify a team must let me know via email (will.read@gmail.com), or at the tournament by the close of registration. In the extremely unlikely event that we actually have to run the competition (e.g., if more than four clubs sign up), we will run it the following weekend, and registrants will be notified.\r\n\r\nFor
