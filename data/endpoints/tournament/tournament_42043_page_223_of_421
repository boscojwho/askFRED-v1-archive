This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

To compete fencers must be unclassified in the particular event they fence.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally there will be non-USFA <b><i>Novice<\/i><\/b> competitions for those who have been fencing less than one year. Please see separate details for the novice events below:\r\n\r\nFor the USFA competitions, all USFA rules will apply. Masks, bodycords and lames will be checked at the armory before competition.\r\n\r\n<b>Waiver:<\/b>\r\nAll competitors must submit a copy of the Gulf Coast Division waiver of liability and consent to treat form. Copies will be available at the venue. You can also download and print your own: https:\/\/app.box.com\/s\/j8a12ltuhjrckczgj8bk\r\n\r\nFencers under age 18 must have a <b><i>parent's signature<\/i><\/b> on this form.\r\n\r\n<b>USFA\/US Fencing Membership:<\/b>\r\nCurrent competitive membership of the USFA required <b>(except for Novice events)<\/b>. Membership forms will be available at the venue. If your membership is not pre-validated, you must be prepared to show proof of USFA membership, or at the door, fill out a membership form and pay at that time.\r\n\r\n<b>Novice events<\/b> require at least the $10.00 non-competitive USFA membership. \r\n\r\nYou may only fence in the novice events if you have been fencing for one year OR LESS. This does NOT mean you may fence novice if, for example, you have been fencing foil for years but never picked up an epee until now. This is for NEW FENCERS. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up for novice, you should expect I will be checking your name against past years of USFA membership and FRED results.\r\n\r\nThe novice events MAY be divided into two events at the time of the tournament based upon the ages of the competitors and at the discretion of tournament organizers.\r\n\r\nNovice foil competitions will NOT require the masks with the competition\/lame' bibs. The OLD bibs (the kind epee fencers still use) will be allowed.\r\n\r\nGFC has a limited number of lame's available. If we have one in your size you can rent one for $20.00. (Sorry, James & Susie just inspected our stock and a lot of them failed, so we have fewer we can rent out).\r\n\r\nALL EVENTS (INCLUDING NOVICE) will be fenced in round-robin pools followed by 100% promotion to Direct Elimination rounds.\r\n\r\nMemberships will be available at the venue OR you can download a form from http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/1407\/2014-15_Individual_Membership_Form.pdf\r\n\r\nPersons under age 18 MUST have a parent's signature on the USFA form.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>USFA Events:<\/b> $20.00 Registration. $10.00 per event fenced. $20.00 late fee for walk-ins not pre-registered via FRED.\r\n\r\n<b>Diversions:<\/b>\r\nHere is a list of links for things to do in Galveston when you are not fencing.\r\n\r\n<b>Texas Seaport Museum \/ The Tall Ship, Elissa<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonhistory.org\/Texas_Seaport_Museum.asp\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pleasurepier\/\r\n\r\n<b>Moody Gardens<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.moodygardens.com\/attractions\/\r\n\r\n<b>Schlitterbahn<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.schlitterbahn.com\/gal\/\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Railroad Museum<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonrrmuseum.com\/\r\n\r\n<b>Lone Star Flight Museum<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.lsfm.org\/\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Duck Tours:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/ducktours\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pier 21 Theater:<\/b> (Three different films: The Great Storm, Galveston-Gateway to the Gulf; and The Pirate Island of Jean Laffite) http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pier21theatre\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pirates!

Being a tourist town, Galveston hotels run the gamut. Of really nice hotels close to the venue there are two that jump out:\r\n \r\nThe Tremont House \r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSTH\/main.wnt?cid=14807\r\n \r\nThe Hotel Galvez\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSHG\/main.wnt?cid=14749\r\n \r\nBoth are \"historic\" hotels operated by Wyndham. Tremont is in the Historic Strand District. The Galvez is on the beach. Neither is quite five minutes from the venue.\r\n \r\nFurther down Seawall Blvd, facing the Gulf of Mexico are three hotels, side by side, offering different price points, as they say. All three face the sea. Most of your drive to the venue would be along Seawall Blvd. from either of these three. It can be a bit busy on a weekend, but you do have the Gulf of Mexico on the right side pretty much 90%\r\nof the way, which can make up for it. In \"high traffic times\" allow fifteen minutes to reach the venue.\r\n \r\nThe San Luis http:\/\/www.sanluisresort.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Hilton http:\/\/www.galvestonhilton.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Holiday Inn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/holidayinnresorts\/hotels\/us\/en\/galveston\/glssb\/hoteldetail\r\n \r\nOne other option that is different but might be fun is Harbor House,which is located along the Galveston Waterfront (near the cruise ship terminals and the waterfront restaurants).\r\nhttp:\/\/www.harborhousepier21.com\/ \r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"1st District Plaza 3801 Market Street","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9571302,"longitude":-75.1984219,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108109,"tournament_id":27328,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Foil  PLEASE NOTE: NEW SPACE ","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-11T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27353,"name":"Hong Kong Veterans Cup 2014","start_date":"2014-10-11","end_date":"2014-10-12","comments":"Mixed Gender Poules if necessary ","prereg_open":"2014-08-20","prereg_close":"2014-09-27","authority":"OTHER","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"General Information -\r\nhttp:\/\/www.lehk.org\/HKVeteransCup2014_GenInfo.pdf\r\n\r\nENTRY FORM - http:\/\/www.lehk.org\/HKVeteransCup2014_EntryForm.pdf\r\n\r\nEntry Fees - HK$300 for Individual Event \/ HK$600 for Team Event\r\n\r\nMen's Events: Age 40+ (born in 1974 or earlier)\r\nLadies' Events: Age 35+ (born in 1979 or earlier)\r\n\r\nPrize:\r\nIndividual Events: Champion, 1st Runner-Up and two 2nd Runner-Ups will be awarded for all six events and each age group of 50+, 60+, 70+ will have one Champion in that age group respectively.\r\nTeam Events: Champion, 1st Runner-Up and one 2nd Runner-Up will be awarded for all six events.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficial Hotel:\r\nNovotel Citygate Hong Kong (only 10 minutes walk to Venue)\r\n\r\nCorporate Discount under \"3rd Hong Kong Veterans Cup\" - For the night of Oct 11 & 12, 2014 inclusive\r\n\r\n1.) 10% off from \"Best Unrestricted Rate\" of the day, and rate is subject to 10% service charge per room per night; current going rate is $2,150 (Subject to availability) \r\n2.) 10% off from \"Hot Deal Rate (non-refundable)\" of the day, and rate is subject to 10% service \tcharge per room per night; current going rate is $1,950 (Subject to availability)\r\n\r\nCancellation Policy       \r\nOption 1 :  \r\nThe hotel will charge 1 night for all guaranteed reservations that have not shown up or been cancelled after 18.00 pm (local time) on the day of arrival.\r\nOption 2 :  \r\n Non-refundable \/ non-transferable of full price of stay will be charged at the time of booking.\r\n\r\n*Buffet Breakfast is available at HKD158 + 10% service charge at Novotel Citygate\r\n\r\nPlease note that our Tournament is overlapping with the China Sourcing Fair at the AWE near the Hong Kong Airport, hence booking status is critical, and I suggest for early booking of your rooms at the Novotel Citygate as soon as possible. \r\n\r\nIndividual Events will be fenced on Saturday afternoon on October 11th, while Team Events will be fenced on Sunday.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience. as always FAP is committed to providing a positive tournament experience for you.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.  \r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA DIVISION IS MAKING A PUSH TO DEVELOP NEW REFEREES this season.  Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"1st District Plaza 3801 Market Street Suite 201","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9571302,"longitude":-75.1984219,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108112,"tournament_id":27330,"tournament":"FAP Div3 Foil PLEASE NOTE NEW SPACE","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":0,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-12T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28104,"name":"Binghamton Fall Open 1","start_date":"2014-10-12","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2014-10-03","prereg_close":"2014-10-11","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Location Information:\r\nEvent will be held at Binghamton University East gym.\r\n\r\nEvent Information:\r\nUnsanctioned Event - competitive membership is not required.Fencing equipment in accordance with US Fencing rules are required. \r\n\r\nRequired Equipment:\r\nJacket, Plastron, Glove in good condition\r\nLame(foil and sabre)\r\nMask\r\nAt least 2 body cords\r\nAt least 2 working weapons\r\n\r\nStart Times:\r\nFoil- 9am \r\nEpee- Noon\r\nSabre- 3pm\r\n\r\nAny questions?

Our goal is to make this year\u0092s event even bigger and better than last years which had 1,378 entries in all events.\r\n\r\nThis SYC is in honor of Steve Sobel. Steve Sobel is a former President of the USFA (1972-1976 and 1992-1996), League Counsel, and past Vice President of the US 3 Committee. He began his fencing achievements as the 1954 NCAA Saber champion for Columbia University. He served as Chief of Mission for the US Pan American Game\u0092s team and USOC Delegate to the Pan American Sports Organization. Steve continues to be an active member of numerous US Fencing committees. .\r\n\r\nSTEVE SOBEL SYC AND CADET INTERNATIONAL EVENT 2014 DETAILS:\r\nThe Steve Sobel SYC is sanctioned by USA Fencing and their Youth Development Committee, and hosted by New Jersey Fencing Alliance (NJFA), Maplewood, NJ. This SYC is part of a group of national events held throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y8, Y10, Y12, Y14 and cadet age categories in all three weapons. USFA competitive membership is required for all events. The Y8 events listed are additional approved events and not part of the SYC.\r\n\r\nThis Elite SYC competition serves as a qualifying event for the Y10, Y12 and path to Nationals for Y14 age categories for the same category and weapon at the USFA March and July NAC\u0092s and 2015 Summer National Championships.  Additionally it provides the opportunity to earn National Youth Points in the Y10, Y12, and Y14.  National Points will be awarded age categories to those fencers placing in the top 40% of the competitive field regardless of where the cut occurs. For example if there are 17 fencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8.  Only the top 6 finishers would earn points.  \r\n\r\nThis tournament is the first event of the prestigious 2014-2015 New Jersey Fencing Alliance (NJFA) Youth Cup Series, Last year over 3400 fencers from the United States, Canada and Mexico competed for the coveted Youth Cup Trophy and title of NJFA Youth Cup Champion.  For more info about the NJFA Youth Cup Series visit New Jersey Fencing Alliance\u0092s web site at http:\/\/www.njfencingalliance.com\r\n\r\nCADET INTERNATIONAL (under-17) EVENTS will once again be an exceptional competition.\r\nThis event is a great warm up for the Nov. 7th Junior, Cadet and Y-14 NAC.  Cadet events are NOT national qualifiers and points cannot be awarded. \r\nAs a special thank you, from New Jersey Fencing Alliance, All Y-14 fencers competing in the same weapon Cadet Event will receive a $10.00 discount the day you check in for the Cadet event.  \r\n\r\nRATINGS: \r\nClassifications may be awarded to fencers in all events based on participation and place.  The competition must meet or exceed criteria in group C1 or higher to award changes in classification.

Fencers must wear the required clothing regulation fencing jacket and pants, underarm protector (plastron), knee socks and a fencing glove that covers half the forearm. The electric foil bib is required. Women must wear breast protectors. In epee and foil, a full jacket is required (i.e., a jacket with croissard \/ groin strap). Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing uniforms or gloves must not have any rips, tears, holes, etc. USA Fencing allows uniforms of a single pastel color or designs on the rear (unarmed) arm and leg. As the purpose of uniform color or design is for audience interest, such designs should be in good taste. For safety and insurance purposes, fencers must wear full fencing attire while participating in drills, lessons or warm-up.\r\n\r\nBlade Length: Y8 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 27.5 inches (\u00930\u0094). & Y10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches. Parents and fencers are advised that blades marketed as \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however some blades labeled as #2 have exceeded 32.5 inches, these blades will not be permitted. \r\n  \r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 7-8am on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly. Those fencing Saturday or Sunday can have their equipment checked Friday any time after 10am.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT CHECK will be open each day. Fencers must present to the armorer for testing of mask, lame jacket, gloves (saber) and body cords. Items passing inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\n\r\nAll events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary inspection will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE to ensure the presence of the following equipment: underarm plastron, weapons, body cords and all appropriate weapons check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met. \r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other required equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules. \r\n\r\nFencers will only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the SYC. \r\n\r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords. Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition. \r\n\r\nNote that Blue Gauntlet Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nThe Steve Sobel SYC and Cadet International Tournament will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on Wednesday, October 15, 2014. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA.

It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/~\/media\/USA_Fencing\/Documents\/About%20Tournaments\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\n\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until the complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Friday or Saturday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Saturday or Sunday of this tournament.\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nPre-registration on FRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Friday, October 10, 2014. After the close of regular pre-registration time to midnight of the day prior to the tournament (October 17), fencers are welcome at triple registration fee and double event fee, if board notified prior to midnight of the day preceding the tournament start date. The day of the event you may fence with a walk-in fee of double triple.  Also, please remember that we only accept cash or checks at Division events. We DO NOT take credit\/debit cards.\r\n\r\nFees: Discounted registration fees are $15 per fencer, plus $15 per event (i.e., a total of $30 for one event) for those that preregister on AskFred on time. If you are auto-qualified for your desired event at the JO, you are still encouraged to fence! (Fees waived for you for that event, but please still preregister on Askfred by the deadline. Please consult with bout committee at check-in to see if your presence will be needed.) Registration fees are non-refundable, but the per-event fees will not be charged if an event is not fenced.\r\n\r\nYou may join or renew your membership at the door, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership. If you join\/renew online, please bring a copy of your membership receipt as proof of membership. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. \r\n\r\nEach fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body cords. Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event, as all equipment must pass inspection in order to fence. We anticipate that we will offer an opportunity to get your equipment tested the night before the event, and will confirm that fact through AskFred. Please make sure that AskFred has your current email address. Weapons are checked on the strip. Foil events use a conductive mask.\r\n\r\nWe need volunteers for this event, so please contact the tournament organizers at Board@usfa-or.org if you can help a shift. Also, healthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area. \r\n\r\nOn July 17th, the USFA Board of Directors adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines new requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. \r\n\r\nCome support our kids, families, and sport!

The events will be staggered so that people wanting to fence in the women\u0092s only events will also be able to participate in the mixed events.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT \u0096 Notice: The format will be finalized based on actual fencer turnout, but will follow the below guidelines. Final actual format will be announced and posted at the time of the event, but will not deviate from the below formulas.\r\n\r\nThis is a sharks and minnows foil event. We will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools as is standard for USFA tournaments. There will be a second round of pools to follow with one separate \"sharks\" group for the top 6-8 fencers (after the first round of pools). These \u0093Sharks\u0094 will be guaranteed to advance into the direct elimination round in the top 6-8 places (determined by the results of the second round of pools). All the \"minnows\" will be sorted based on their first round pool performance for their second round of pools with other minnows. Direct eliminations will follow based on the second round of pools (the sharks have a guaranteed spot) adding some of the the top seeded fencers in the minnows group after the second round of pools. Not everyone will advance to direct eliminations though this format will allow two rounds of pools with the second round more equal in fencing strength which allows more and better fencing for everyone.\r\n\r\nIf we have 24 or fewer fencers, the top 16 fencers will advance to the direct elimination table, with 25-63 fencers we will advance the top 24 fencers, and if we somehow manage to have a competition of 64 or more fencers we will advance the top 32. Depending on the number of participants we may need to fence pools in two flights. Either way, there will be plenty of fencing for all participants.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled and start times:\r\nMixed Foil \u0096 8:00 AM\r\nWomen\u0092s Epee \u0096 8:30 AM\r\nMixed Epee \u0096 1:00 PM\r\nWomen\u0092s Foil \u0096 1:30 PM\r\nMore Notes:\r\n\r\nEpee fencers will NOT be allowed to use a foil mask with a conductive bib in epee, as this can block valid touches to that area of the bib.\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: IUP October Fencing Fest\r\nDate(s): 10\/18\/2014\r\nLocation: Zink Hall Gyms A and B\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nSenior Women's Sharks and Minnows Format.
