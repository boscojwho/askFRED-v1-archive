You may join the USFA or renew your membership at the tournament.  All competitors under age 18 must bring a waiver signed by a parent or guardian (see waiver below).\r\n\r\nDirections:  From I-90 East, take Exit 11 A.  \r\nVeer right (south) off the exit onto 150th.  \r\nDrive straight up the hill in the left lane to the light on Newport Way.  \r\nTurn left (east) onto Newport Way.  \r\nGo two blocks to Eastgate Elementary and turn right (south) onto 152nd.\r\nThis winds uphill and becomes 150th.  Go about half a mile.\r\nLook for a green street sign on your right that says, \"Hillside School\" and points left.  \r\nTurn left onto SE 46th Way into the \u0093Whispering Heights\u0094 neighborhood.\r\nGo about half a mile to a three way stop.  \r\nDrive straight through it.  The street numbers change several times as it curves, \r\nbut stay on the main drag for about a half mile more \r\nuntil you come to a choice between a right turn up a steep hill or a dead end on 159th Pl SE.  \r\nDrive into the end of the dead end and park on the side of the street \r\n(there is little parking on campus).\r\nWalk down the driveway to Hillside.  Of the three structures you will see, the barnlike one to the left is our (somewhat primitive) gym.\r\n\r\nFor more information contact:\r\nKael Sherrard\r\n5033 159th Pl.

Fencers will be seeded as Ranked fencers and Classified fencers. \r\nRanked Fencers\r\nCategory 1) Nationally Ranked fencers in a particular weapon who have achieved a ranking in the Top 32 in Senior Points will be entitled to a seeded draw ahead of all other fencers in that weapon. \r\nCategory 2) SSCC Ranked fencers ranking in the Top 8 in SSCC points for the CURRENT season shall be entitled to a seeded draw ahead of all fencers except those in Category 1. Note this does not affect the seeding of the first SSCC event of each year.\r\nCategory 3) Other Nationally ranked fencers who have points in the Senior Category will be seeded ahead of all other fencers with the same letter classification in that weapon.\r\nCategory 4) Other SSCC Ranked fencers who have points in the from places 9-32 in SSCC points for the CURRENT season will be seeded ahead of fencers with the same letter classification but behind those in Category 3 in that weapon. Note this does not affect the seeding of the first SSCC event of each year.\r\nClassified fencers\r\nFencers holding a classification in the weapon being fenced, but not having a ranking under the current national point system or the top 32 of SSCC points in the weapon in question will be seeded according to their letter classification first, and, within the same letter classification, by their numeric classification.\r\n\r\nSponsors\r\nSeveral generous sponsors help to make the SSCC possible. We thank them for their support!\r\nhttp:\/\/www.southwestfencing.org\/SSCC\/sponsors0405.html\r\n\r\nInfo on awards\r\nAs part of their award from last season's SSCC events for being in the top three point holders in their event, the fencers listed on this page http:\/\/www.southwestfencing.org\/SSCC\/SSCCnews.html#freeentries have free entry to all SSCC events this season.
