For junior fencers who compete in all three weapons, the men's and women's 3-weapon trophies will be awarded to the best combined finishers.\r\n\r\nFencers who want to fence at JOs in February must qualify at this event unless they have national points.  \r\n\r\nThis event is only open to current members of the USFA Western Washington Division.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Event Schedule ---------\r\nSaturday 12\/17\/11:\r\n9:30 AM  -- Doors open\r\n10:00 AM -- Junior Men's Epee, Junior Women's Epee\r\n1:00 PM  -- Junior Men's Saber, Junior Women's Saber\r\n2:00 PM  -- Cadet Men's Epee, Cadet Women's Epee\r\n3:00 PM  -- Cadet Men's Saber, Cadet Women's Saber\r\n\r\nSunday 12\/18\/11:\r\n9:30 AM  -- Doors open\r\n10:00 AM -- Junior Men's Foil, Junior Women's Foil\r\n1:00 PM  -- Cadet Men's Foil, Cadet Women's Foil\r\n\r\nAll times listed are close of registration.

If you join\/renew online, please bring a copy of your membership receipt as proof of membership.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\nUSA Fencing has NOT yet adopted the electric foil mask bib for non-national events, so \"standard\" foil\/epee masks may be used. Fencers may wear masks with the new bib, but any touches scored on the bib cannot be annulled.\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark masks, lames, body cords, sabre mask cords, and sabre overgloves.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70496,"tournament_id":16658,"tournament":"Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-12-18T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15648,"name":"Capitol Division Y12 & Under Mixed Tournament","start_date":"2011-12-18","end_date":"","comments":"USFA membership and full uniform required. \r\nOpen only to fencers born between 1999 and 2004, inclusive. \r\nCost is $30 ($5.00 registration fee plus $25.00 per event entered.)\r\n\r\nThe epee is limited to 18 fencers & foil is limited to 18 fencers.\r\n","prereg_open":"2011-08-08","prereg_close":"2011-12-17","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"USFA membership and full uniform required. \r\nOpen only to fencers born between 1999 and 2004, inclusive. \r\n\r\nThe epee is limited to 18 fencers & foil is limited to 18 fencers.\r\n\r\nRegistration fee: $5.00\r\nEvent fee: $25.00 (per event entered)\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY10 & Y12 Mixed Epee\r\nY10 & Y12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/08\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/17\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rockville Fencing Academy","address":"15221 Display Court","city":"Rockville","state":"MD","zip":"20850","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.1055295,"longitude":-77.1449148,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":25,"name":"Capitol","abbrev":"CAP","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":66450,"tournament_id":15648,"tournament":"Capitol Division Y12 & Under Mixed Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":11,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-12-18T09:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":66451,"tournament_id":15648,"tournament":"Capitol Division Y12 & Under Mixed Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-12-18T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15913,"name":"Colorado Junior Olympic Qualifiers","start_date":"2011-12-18","end_date":"","comments":"Qualification to compete in the Junior Olympics in February at Salt Lake City.\r\n\r\nCadet and Junior Women's and Men's Epee, Foil, and Sabre. $15 Registration fee, $15 each event. \r\n\r\nSEE MORE INFO PAGE FOR DETAILS  ","prereg_open":"2011-10-23","prereg_close":"2011-12-04","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":15,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Preregistration opens on 10\/23\/\/2011\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/04\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\nU17 & U20 Women's and Men's Epee, Foil, and Sabre.\r\n$15 Registration fee $15 each event.\r\n\r\nPRE-REGISTRATION CLOSES ON 12\/04 - NO LATE REGISTRATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Events generally start fencing about 30 minutes after close of registration.  First events of the day may start sooner.\r\n\r\nDoors open about 45 minutes before the first event.\r\n\r\nFencers planning to fence two age groups are advised there will be some overlap between events (for example, you may have to fence some Y12 DE bouts during your Y14 pool if you're doing well in the Y12s). Directors are used to this and will not scratch your bouts if you're fencing in the other event; however, fencing in two events is your choice - please be ready to fence a few bouts in a row if need be to keep your events moving.\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation & Parking\r\nTake the F\/G trains to Carroll Street station or get driving directions at http:\/\/www.brooklynfencing.com\/directions.html\r\nFor more information, visit our website, http:\/\/www.brooklynfencing.com or call 718.522.5822.\r\n\r\nThere is easy street parking around the club; however, be sure not to park in the \"no standing\" red signed zone directly in front of the club - you may well get a ticket even on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry & Eligibility\r\n$35 pre-registered on AskFred \/ $50 walk-ins at the door.  We encourage you to pre-register.\r\n \r\nYou must belong to the USFA or another FIE federation with proof of membership in order to compete.  Join or renew at http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership.  If you need to join the USFA on-site, you will need a separate check or credit card # for their form.  For the $20 one-day membership option, you MUST complete the membership online at usfencing.org ahead of time and bring your e-mail confirmation with you.\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition.
