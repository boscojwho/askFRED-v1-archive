At the light at the end of the exit ramp, take a left heading back over I-65.  Go through the first light (which is just an entrance back onto I-65) until you reach the second light at a fairly big intersection (a BP gas station will be on your right).  At this intersection of Lakeshore Boulevard and Greensprings Highway, turn left heading north on Greensprings Highway (toward downtown).  At the second traffic light, turn left onto Raleigh Avenue.  Then turn left at the second stop sign.  The school will be on your left.  The gym entrance is behind the school.\r\n\r\nIf heading north on I-65 (as if coming from Montgomery), the Lakeshore exit will be about one mile past the Alford Avenue exit.  Take a right at the light at the end of the exit ramp.  You will be taking a left at the same Lakeshore\/Greensprings intersection described above (with the BP station on your right).  Continue following the directions to the school as noted above.\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble finding the venue on the day of the tournament, call (205) 410-8183.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the Birmingham Fencing Club and a full schedule of our tournaments for this season, please visit our website at www.fencingclub.org\r\n\r\nFor results from our most recent tournaments, please see our website or see the results listed at www.AskFred.net\r\n \r\nBirmingham Fencing Club\r\nWright Memorial Fencing Tournament 2005\r\nEntry Form\r\n\r\nName________________________________\r\nClub__________________________\r\nAddress______________________________\r\nDivision_______________________\r\nE-mail_______________________________\t\r\n\/ \/ Male\t\/ \/ Female\r\nBirth Date ____________Age____________\t\r\nUSFA Number_________________\r\n\r\nCost: --  $15 for the first event\r\n               $10 for each additional event\r\n               $15 late fee for registrations at the door\r\n\r\nEvent :                      Rating\/Year\t   Fee      \r\n            \r\nY12 Foil\t\t _____\t  ___    \r\nOpen Foil\t\t_____\t  ___\r\nWomen\u0092s Foil\t_____\t  ___\t\r\nY12 Sabre\t\t_____ \t  ___\r\nOpen Epee \t_____\t  ___\t\r\nOpen Sabre\t_____\t  ___\t\r\nWomen\u0092s Epee              _____            ___\t\t\r\nBox Lunch Pre-Order @ $7 per lunch\t\t\t\r\nTotal\t$__________\t\t\r\n\r\nMake checks payable to the Birmingham Fencing Club.\r\nMail to:    Birmingham Fencing Club\r\n                1425 Montgomery Hwy., Suite 25\r\n                Birmingham, Alabama  35216\r\n\r\nWaiver\r\nI hereby waive and release all rights and claims for damages I may have against the Birmingham Fencing Club, Hall-Kent Elementary School, the United States Fencing Association, the officials, managers, sponsors, and other participants from any and all liabilities arising from illness, losses, injuries or damages I may suffer as a result of my participation in the 2005 Birmingham Fencing Club Wright Memorial fencing tournament.

You may join the USFA or renew your membership at the tournament.  All competitors under age 18 must bring a waiver signed by a parent or guardian (see waiver below).\r\n\r\nDirections:\r\nFrom I-90 East, take Exit 11 A.  \r\nVeer right (south) off the exit onto 150th.  \r\nDrive straight up the hill in the left lane to the light on Newport Way.  \r\nTurn left (east) onto Newport Way.  \r\nGo two blocks to Eastgate Elementary and turn right (south) onto 152nd.\r\nThis winds uphill and becomes 150th.  Go about half a mile.\r\nLook for a green street sign on your right that says, \"Hillside School\" and points left.  \r\nTurn left onto SE 46th Way into the \u0093Whispering Heights\u0094 neighborhood.\r\nGo about half a mile to a three way stop.  \r\nDrive straight through it.  The street numbers change several times as it curves, \r\nbut stay on the main drag for about a half mile more \r\nuntil you come to a choice between a right turn up a steep hill or a dead end on 159th Pl SE.  \r\nDrive into the end of the dead end and park on the side of the street \r\n(there is little parking on campus).\r\nWalk down the driveway to Hillside.  Of the three structures you will see, the barnlike one to the left is our (somewhat primitive) gym.\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\nWAIVER OF LIABILITY\r\nI hereby waive and release Hillside Cavaliers Fencing Club, Hillside Student Community, and their representatives from any and all liability for an injury or illness incurred while participating in tournaments or club or school activities.  \r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nFencer's Signature                                                 Date\r\n\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nParent's or Guardian's Signature                           Date\r\n\r\nFor more information contact:\r\nKael Sherrard\r\n5033 159th Pl.
