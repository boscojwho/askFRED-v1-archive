If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

The objective is to provide Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers with individual club fencing qualification based on the series of tournaments throughout 2015-2016 fencing season. Each participant will be awarded with a number of points earned in a specific event at each competition. Each age group belongs to a specific Maximum Points bracket:\r\n\r\nAge Group Max. Points\r\nY10 50\r\nY12 100\r\nY14 200\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the earned Points at each event is as follows:\r\n\r\n((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x Maximum Points\r\n\r\n1st place receives the Maximum Points, while all consecutive places will receive the corresponding Points calculated through the above formula.

Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

There are no national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and will serve as a qualification path to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. For more details on this initiative, refer to the Regional Youth Recognition Initiative document here: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6318\/Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative__1_.pdf\r\n\r\nNAC\/Nationals Qualification through the RYC points list:\r\n\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete.

Our goal is to create a positive tournament experience and setting for every fencer, while providing a level of professionalism expected of an elite fencing center.\r\n\r\nThe SFSFL incorporates two Circuits within its infrastructure, The Junior & Open Circuit (JOC) and The Individual Challenge Circuit (ICC).  The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.  These ranking systems mirror that of the National Governing Body, USA Fencing, and the International Governing Body, Federation International de\u0092 Escrime (FIE).  Each tournament in the JOC will award fencers in the final four with medals.  Each tournament in the ICC will award the final eight fencers with medals.  These circuits also provide seasonal awards for Overall Ranking Champions and Individual Champions, as well as MVP, Coaches Awards, etc.\r\n\r\nEVENTS INCLUDE:\r\nOpen Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nJunior Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nDivision-3 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-12 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-10 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-8 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE: (all times = close of registration)\r\nSaturday:\r\n2pm \u0096 Division-3 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-8 Mixed Sabre\r\nSunday:\r\n10am \u0096 Open Mixed Sabre\r\n10am \u0096 Youth-12 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Junior Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-10 Mixed Sabre\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\nSabre Outreach Network\r\nDuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center\r\n3017 NW 60th St\r\nFort Lauderdale, FL  33308\r\n\r\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\r\n954-990-0090\r\nMitchB5659@comcast.net\r\nDan.Berliner@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/29\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/17\/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"DuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center","address":"3017 NW 60th St","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state":"FL","zip":"33309","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":26.2007656,"longitude":-80.1860775,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":120308,"tournament_id":30568,"tournament":"April Fool's Duel - SFSFL # 8","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-16T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120309,"tournament_id":30568,"tournament":"April Fool's Duel - SFSFL # 8","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y8MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-16T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120310,"tournament_id":30568,"tournament":"April Fool's Duel - SFSFL # 8","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":0,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120311,"tournament_id":30568,"tournament":"April Fool's Duel - SFSFL # 8","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120312,"tournament_id":30568,"tournament":"April Fool's Duel - SFSFL # 8","full_name":"Junior Mixed Saber","short_name":"JrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":0,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120313,"tournament_id":30568,"tournament":"April Fool's Duel - SFSFL # 8","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":31083,"name":"SAS Saber #6: Y10, Y12, Y14, Open","start_date":"2016-04-16","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2015-08-27","prereg_close":"2016-04-16","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"<b>SAS SABER #6: Y10, Y12, Y14, Open + Team<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE<\/b>\r\n11:30am -- Y10 Mixed Saber\r\n11:30am -- Y14 Mixed Saber\r\n12:30pm -- Y12 Mixed Saber\r\n1:30pm -- Senior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\n<b>ENTRY<\/b>\r\nThis event is sanctioned by the Western Washington Division and ratings can be awarded.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USFA competitive membership is required.

Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n\r\nThe conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm. \r\nIn order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout. \r\nThe conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/04\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/09\/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Center of Chicago","address":"111 S.

Due to circumstances beyond our control, we lost the West Center at Winthrop. In light of this, we are waiving the late fee for any registrations. The final deadline for online registration and payment will be 4\/1\/2016 and there will be no late-fee charges.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions about this or have any problems, please contact the SC division chair at chair@scfencing.org\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION DEADLINE: 4\/01\/16 at 11:59PM\r\n\r\nNOTE: to fencers who have not yet gotten their competitive USFA memberships - fencers who buy their memberships AFTER April 1st get the added benefit of having their memberships also covered for the next season. If you want to take advantage of this offer, please go ahead and register (and pay) on askFred by the 4\/1\/16 deadline and wait until after April 1st to get your membership. We will work with you so that you can sign up for this tournament and also be able to get the benefit of buying a membership after April 1st.\r\n\r\nPLEASE TAKE NOTE: The final close of registration is two weeks before the event.\r\n \r\nIMPORTANT: USA Fencing requires a new 800N Saber glove for all sanctioned tournaments after 10\/1\/15. You will need to have a glove meeting this requirement, or you will not be eligible to compete in any saber events at this tournament.  More info here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/537287?referrer_id=669365\r\n\r\nENTRY & ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nIndividual event times will be posted the week after online registration closes. Please check back and be sure you arrive on time! It is your responsibility to check if event times change. We will make every effort to post the event times as soon as possible after registration closes. There is NO registration at the event, only check-in. You MUST register and pay on askFRED if you want to fence.\r\n\r\nNote: If registration numbers are high, there is a chance that some of the events will need to be pushed to Sunday April 17th. If that is the case, we will make every effort to notify and coordinate with fencers to make sure that they can fence on Sunday.\r\n\r\nAll close of registration (check-in) times are in Eastern Standard Time (EST). The events will typically start approx. 30 minutes after close of registration, but absolutely NO check-ins will be accepted after close of registration. NO EXCEPTIONS! Please arrive early to have your equipment checked and allow warm-up and registration time. Venue will be opened at least 1 hour prior to close of registration of first event. \r\n\r\nAll registrants pay a one-time Registration Fee of $20 + an event fee of $20 for each event entry (i.e If you register for one event, you will pay a total of $40, if you register for two events, you will only pay a total of $60).  \r\n\r\nThe registration deadline is Friday, 4\/01\/16 at 11:59PM. Any registrations after that time will NOT be accepted! NO WALK-INS! In order for your registration to be valid, you MUST complete payment via askfred.net (to make payments via check, please contact chair@scfencing.org for instructions. Registration will not be complete until payment is received; NO payments accepted the day of the tournament). Registering for an event without payment is not considered a valid registration. Registration is ONLY valid once payment is received. This means that if you do not complete payment prior to the close of registration on 4\/01\/16 at 11:59PM, you will NOT be allowed to fence in the event! \r\n\r\nNO EXCEPTIONS! REGISTER AND PAY EARLY!\r\n\r\nNote that all of the Senior events are C & Under events. askFRED validates fencers for gender, age, rating and division. It will not allow you to register for events you should not be in. If you feel you should be able to register for an event and askFRED is not allowing you to do so, please verify that your profile information in askFRED is correct for gender, age and division. If you still have a problem, contact the division chair at chair@scfencing.org\r\n\r\nThe Senior events are combined qualifying events. Fencers competing in those events can qualify for Div2, Div3 and Vet. If there are 3 or fewer fencers registered for an event after the close of registration on 4\/01\/16, the event will not be fenced, and the fencer does not need to attend the event. Those fencers will auto-qualify for the Summer Nationals even though they do not fence.\r\n\r\nThe Registration and event fees for unfenced events will be refunded (minus askFred fees) but only if requested in writing (email) and received by 4\/23\/16 (one week after the event). \r\n\r\nAll fencers must have a current USFA competitive membership by close of late registration. ONLY members of the SC Division of USA Fencing may compete in this qualifier. You may join or renew your membership here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced (Read more here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail chair@scfencing.org to request addition to the competition.\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and South Carolina Division Sanctioned event; ratings will be awarded where earned.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION FORMAT:\r\n\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination.\r\n\r\nUNIFORMS & EQUIPMENT:\r\n\r\nFencers are required to have complete fencing uniforms as required by USA Fencing.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free onsite parking!

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership.
