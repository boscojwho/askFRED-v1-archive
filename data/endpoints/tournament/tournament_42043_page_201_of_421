If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event.  Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2013-14 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2014, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1994-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1995-2001 and for the cadet events 1998-2001.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"191 W 58 Street","city":"New

We check data ahead of time for each tournament; adding fencers on the spot is much slower than removing absent fencers.\r\n\r\nEligibility Restrictions:\r\nASKFRED is enforcing gender, age, and division membership restrictions. \r\n\r\nEverything you need to know, especially age eligibility for this competition and for the Junior Olympics 2014 event can be found at:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/273939?referrer_id=669372-usa-fencing-news\r\n\r\nPoints lists are here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Athlete-Info\/Rankings\/Current-Rankings.aspx\r\n* A discrepancy HAS been observed between the RailStation points records and the USFA PDF Points Lists.  PLEASE NOTE: The USFA points lists are the OFFICIAL RECORD OF POINTS.\r\n\r\nAutoqualifier list is here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/922635-2014-national-championship-auto-qualifiers\r\n\r\nEligibility:\r\n- U.S. citizen OR permanent resident who has not represented another country in the last three years.\r\n- Current competitive member of USA FENCING.\r\n- The athlete's birth year falls in that age bracket OR on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket\r\n\r\nUNDER-17 (CADET) CHAMPIONSHIPS\r\nFencers must be born between 1\/1\/1997 and 12\/31\/2000 AND BE\r\n    On the Cadet NRPS as of the entry deadline for JOs OR\r\n    In the top 8 of the Youth 14 NRPS as of the entry deadline for JOs OR\r\n    Qualified for the Under-20 JO Championships (BOD, 10\/04) OR\r\n    In the top 25% [refer to Table 1] in their Division\u0092s Under-17 J.O. qualifying competition (BOD, 10\/04)\r\n\r\nUNDER-20 (JUNIOR) CHAMPIONSHIPS\r\nFencers must be born between 1994 and 2000 AND BE\r\n    On the Junior NRPS on January 21, 2013 OR\r\n    In the top 16 of the Cadet NRPS as of the entry deadline for JOs OR\r\n    In the top 25% [refer to Table 1] in their Division\u0092s Under-20 J.O. qualifying competition (BOD, 10\/04)\r\n\r\nUnderage fencers eligible by NRPS standing should e-mail the organizers to be added to events where FRED rejects the pre-registration.\r\n\r\nU-17 (Cadet) Events: Birth years are 1997-2000.\r\nU-20 (Junior) Events: Birth years are 1994-2000.\r\n\r\nDivision membership is based on your official, declared USFA membership affiliation.  There are two ways to be sure you are affiliated with South Texas PRIOR to the qualifier:\r\n\r\n1.  Go to http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\/current-membership-listing and select the South Texas Division from the center dropdown menu at the bottom of the page.  If your name appears, your affiliation SHOULD be correct.\r\n\r\n2.  Visit https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/Login.aspx?Redirect=Profile.aspx?returnurl=default.aspx and access your user profile.  Verify that your division listing is correct.  Take the time to verify your club information as well, since that club affiliation is what we are required to use to seed the events.\r\n\r\nIf either or both of these methods do not show you affiliated with South Texas Division, but you feel you should attend our qualifiers, contact the National Office by phone or email to request your information be updated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMasks, body and mask cords, lames and saber manchettes\/gloves will be tested.\r\n\r\nFencers may and are encouraged to fence in all events on a given day, but in order to keep the tournament on schedule, no three- or ten-minute rest will be given in one event for a bout just fenced in a different event.\r\n\r\nEvents will be fenced as one round of pools (if there are at least four non-autoqualified fencers) with 100% promotion to DEs. If fewer than four non-auto-qualified fencers register for an individual event, the organizers reserve the option not to conduct any fencing for the event, and declare all fencers to have qualified.  Would-be qualifiers must show up and pay their event fee in order to be considered qualified, even if no fencing is conducted.\r\n\r\nAll participants must sign a Waiver of Liability. Anyone under age 18 must have a parent's or legal guardian's signature on this form (not a coach).","venue":{"name":"Austin Fencers' Club","address":"4425 Red

If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

Restaurants and micro-breweries are varied and plentiful. The Hilton Gardens is a brief RTD light rail trip to, and the downtown Courtyard Marriott and Embassy Suites are within easy walking distance of, the Denver Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, the Pepsi Center, Coors Field, the newly opened History Colorado Center, and the Denver Art Museum. In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly. REI\u0092s flagship store, with its four story climbing wall, the Downtown Aquarium, and Elitch Gardens amusement park are about 1.3 mile walks.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to range a bit further, The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a can\u0092t miss attraction for lovers of all things dinosaur. Next door to the Museum of Nature and Science is the Denver Zoo. The new Elephant Passage exhibit recently opened.
