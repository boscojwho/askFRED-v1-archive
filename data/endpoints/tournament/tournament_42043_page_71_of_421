This season, we are asking every club in the Division to try to put together at least one junior or senior team to compete in this important qualifying event.\r\n\r\nTo correct some major misunderstandings about this team event, the qualifying teams gain qualification for their club (if they represent one).  Specific team members need not plan to attend the summer national championships in order to compete in the qualifier.  If a team qualifies, any representatives of the club may go to the summer nationals as part of that team.\r\n\r\nTeam competition follows a 9-bout, round-robin competition in a single weapon with relay-style scoring to a maximum of 45 touches.  Teams are randomly assigned by the FencingTime software to an elimination table, and compete in a direct elimination round until we reach the number of teams that can qualify in each weapon.\r\n\r\nWe encourage everyone who wishes to compete in this important qualifying event.  We hope to see fencers from all parts of the Division participating on March 20-21.  Please register well in advance so we can have the requisite number of officials available to give you the best team competition possible. The on time registration fee is $75. A $50 LATE CHARGE WILL BE ADDED TO THE REGISTRATION COST STARTING 3\/14\/2010.\r\n\r\nSummer National qualifier for all Junior and Senior teams composed of NJ Division fencers.

On Saturday, May 2nd an email will be sent out announcing which events will be fenced and at what time.  If any events need to be fenced, they will be fenced on Sunday, May 3rd at Salle Auriol Seattle.\r\n\r\nThe fencers that you list as the team members at the qualifier do not have to be the fencers that actually attend the events at Summer Nationals.   \r\n\r\nAll fencers on the Senior team must be born in 1995 or earlier.

Tournament cost is 10.00. \r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door.*\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Senior Circuit #4 and will be based on points earned in Senior Circuits #1-4.  This first series will be entirely foil.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Senior Circuit #8 and will be based on Senior Circuits #5-8. The second series will be exclusively epee.  Trophies will be awarded to the top 3 points earners in each series, respectively.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1)  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of participants equals the number of points.  So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points.  The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age by January 1st of the 2008-09 season or higher are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.  Trophies will be given out at the last tournament of each series.

All entrants will receive a limited edition T-shirt.\r\n\r\n<b>Perks<\/b>\r\nYou'll feel like a star, with backstage dressing rooms, showers, refreshments and snacks, a short bio in our program, and various other perks that include a free ticket to the event (which includes a casino night) that you can give to a friend or sponsor.\r\n\r\nThe top fundraisers will receive additional perks, such as private dressing rooms. \r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying<\/b>\r\nTo enter this event, fencers must have (or have had at one time) at least a C (USFA) or Junior (AFL) classification in at least one weapon (at the time of registration) and must be a member of, and have permission from an Oregon or Washington USFA or AFL fencing club. All fencers must be members of either the AFL or the USFA.\r\n\r\n<b>Format & Weapons<\/b>\r\nIn keeping with the 1920s theme, the competition will use American Fencing League (AFL) three-weapon rules and all bouts will be judged entirely by jury (i.e. dry).  The format will be direct elimination (without repechage), with a fence-off for the bronze medal.  Seeding is determined by donations (see: Fees, below).  Three-weapon bouts are fought without time limit for 8 points. The first weapon fenced is foil. When the aggregate score reaches 5, the fencers switch to \u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a9e and the fencing continues. If the aggregate score reaches 10, the fencers will switch to sabre.   For complete rules, visit: http:\/\/www.americanfencingleague.org.\r\n\r\n<b>Equipment<\/b>\r\nAll fencers must use USFA-compliant equipment, except weapons may be dry or electric. Uniforms must be white (including socks, but excluding gloves). Uniform lettering is not required, and, of course, neither are lam\u00c3\u00a9s and body cords.\r\n\r\n<b>Registration<\/b>\r\nWe are limiting registration to 12 fencers from clubs in Washington and Oregon. (The two-fencer-per-salle limit is no longer in force.)  Registration opens on March 27th and closes on May 1st May 2nd at 11:59 p.m.  Fees are due at the time of registration and are not refundable.  Registrations will only be accepted through AskFred.net.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees<\/b>\r\nEach fencer must pay a $50 fee to complete their registration.  \r\n\r\nIn addition to this fee, fencers are <i>requested<\/i>to collect donations (whether in the form of pledges, sponsorships, or donations) of any amount, which they will turn in at check-in on the day of the event.  Fencers may collect these donations from friends, family, or themselves.  Fencers will be seeded by the amount of money that they raise (and then by lot should there be a tie).  This is important to know because the top seeded fencers may receive a bye, thus giving them a competitive edge.  There is no upper limit to the amount of money a fencer may raise, but only the amount turned in will be counted (no credit will be given for unfulfilled pledges).\r\n\r\n<b>Location<\/b>\r\nThis event will be held at the historic Elsinore Theatre in downtown Salem, Oregon.  Fencers coming from out of town can stay at a variety of hotels.  The Phoenix Grand Hotel is within walking distance of the Elsinore.  For directions to the event, visit the Elsinore website at www.elsinoretheatre.com.  We may also be able to arrange for a home-stay for a limited number of fencers.\r\n\r\n<b>Officials<\/b>\r\nThe director will be Josh Conner from Salle Trois Armes in Portland. The judges will be a group of experienced fencers who are used to visual judging. \r\n\r\nEven so, please remember the old adage of visually judged fencing: it typically takes seven <i>clear<\/i> touches to win a five-touch bout. \r\n\r\nSo, even though you will <i>not<\/i> be judged on form, clear, well-executed actions will be easier for the judges to see. All other things being equal, the fencer with the cleaner fencing will have a competitive edge.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","venue":{"name":"The Historic Elsinore Theatre","address":"170 High Street SE","city":"Salem","state":"OR","zip":"97301","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":44.938875,"longitude":-123.03738,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":36957,"tournament_id":8285,"tournament":"Aldo Nadi Three-Weapon Invitational","full_name":"Mixed Three-weapon combined event Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Three-weapon combined event","close_of_reg":"2009-05-15T18:45:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":8036,"name":"NEUSFA - Y12 Mixed Foil @ PDF","start_date":"2009-05-15","end_date":"","comments":"Y12 Mixed Foil.\r\n$15 with AskFred Preregistration, $20 at the door.
