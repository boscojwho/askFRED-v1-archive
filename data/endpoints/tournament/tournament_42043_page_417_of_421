The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of escrimeur youth cup points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCalculations\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of points (mxpnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge group     mxpnts\r\n\r\nY8\t       50\r\nY10\t       50\r\nY12\t      100\r\nY14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of evntxratio:\r\nEvntxratio = nentrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n((nentrs - pl + 1) \/ nentrs) x mxpnts x evntxratio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned points for escrimeur youth cup series will be a sum of all points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . \r\nLiability waiver\r\n\r\n*** Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by escrimeur.

How to do this: go to www.askfred.net and click on \"My FRED\".  You will be prompted to sign in (there is a forgotten password option if needed). Once signed in, you will see a screen with all upcoming tournaments that you are signed up for.  Next to each is a small red X.  Click on this to remove yourself from a tournament.   If unable to sign in, you can email me and let me know you.  If you must cancel the morning of the tournament, please text me at 802-779-6530.\r\n\r\nRead on for lots of important information about this unique outdoor epee tournament!\r\n\r\nWeather: the weather forecast as of today (Wednesday) looks great for this weekend, so unless things change drastically, everything will go ahead as scheduled on Saturday.\r\n\r\nCovid safety:  Masks are optional, and all fencing is outdoors.  Please stay home if you are not feeling well.\r\n\r\nSet up: 8:30-9:30\r\nRegistration and warm up time: 9:30-10:30 a.m.   Please arrive and check in no later than 10 a.m.  Location for most of the tournament (except finals) will be the lakeside Pavillion\/Kings Garden area.  The entrance to Fort Ticonderoga is located near the Shoreham-Ti ferry, right near the railroad tracks.   You will encounter a ticket booth along the road in (may not be staffed before 9:30 am)  Turn left at sign for Kings Garden.  Park in lot on your left before reaching the competition area.  If you have a lot of gear to unload (more than the usual fencing bags), you may continue on the gravel driveway to the competition area, unload, turn around and go back out to park.  Please do not drive on the grass for any reason.  If you wish to visit the Log House (bathrooms, water, snack bar, souvenir shop, museum entrance) continue straight along the entrance road without taking the Kings Garden turn.  \r\n\r\nFor more information on visiting Fort Ticonderoga:\r\nwww.fortticonderoga.org\r\nI encourage you to take some time to visit the fort and its museum, and learn about the role of the Champlain Valley in 18th century history.\r\n\r\nCompetitors should check in to pay entry fee and sign the liability waiver.  Entry fee is $20.  Exact change (or payment by check) is appreciated!  Competitors entry fees include admission to Fort Ticonderoga for the day. If the ticket booth is staffed in the morning, or to tour the fort later in the day entering through the Log House, tell the staff that you are a competitor or official of the epee tournament (they are not issueing paper passes this year, they are expecting us and relying on honor system).  Fencers, please encourage your guests to buy tickets - not only is the fort very interesting to visit, but they depend heavily on ticket sales to keep the site open to the public (although it is a national historic landmark, it is operated by a private foundation, not the government).    Guests who are only visiting the Kings Garden to observe the tournament, and not touring the fort itself may be able to convice the person at the ticket booth to let you in for free or reduced price (not sure about this, but you can ask).   Or you can volunteer to help with set up, clean up and meet management, and get in for free (but if you tell them you are an official, please volunteer and help out).\r\n\r\nFencing will start promptly at 10:30 a.m.   There will be a pool round, where you fence everyone in your assigned group of 5-9 fencers a 5 point bout, folllowed by a direct elimination (DE) which is a knock-out round of 15 point bouts (10 for Youth).  If there is time and the weather cooperates, there will also be a DE round for the best 8 female competitors from the mixed event.   The senior event is open to all fencers born 2009 or before, and the youth event is for kids born 2010 or earlier.   Fort Ti has invited us to once again hold our finals in the parade ground, which is really cool (people can watch from the ramparts of the fort).  So, as we get down to the top 4 competitors in the open, and the top 2 women, we will pack up strips at the Kings Garden and need volunteers to quickly set up a single, battery powered strip in the parade ground.  We will all then decamp to the parade ground (drive your car up there, it's a long walk) for the 2 semifinal bouts, the womens final, and the open final (if one or both finalists in the open happen to be women, they will need to be tough!). \r\n\r\nWhat to bring:  Most important, bring LOTS of water.  The closest drinking water is a very long uphill walk (or drive) away, at the Log House.  Fill your water bottles before driving down to the competition area.  Bring sunscreen and sunglasses.  You might want a tarp to put your gear on if the ground is wet with dew in the morning, and\/or a lawn chair.  If you are shy about changing in public or in your car, change your clothes in the Log House restrooms before driving down.  There is a portalet at the competition area, but not a full restroom.  Fencing surfaces are grass, gravel and dirt (mostly grass).  They are slippery and uneven.  Understand that you fence at your own risk and should exercise judgement in your choice of moves and fencing style.  Regular indoor fencing shoes are not recommended - you will do better with something with a bit more tread (my choice is trail running shoes).  Similarly, your nicest white knickers are not recommended as they may get grass stains.  Instead, bring an older pair of fencing pants, or cover your knickers with wind pants, or wear any sturdy long pants (no shorts, tights or flimsy wind pants, and no low-rider jeans that don't fully overlap with your jacket at all times).  All fencing will be electric.  Attempt toe touches at your own risk - mud in your tip is possible if you miss.  Please note: backpacks, backpack baby carriers, food, beverages and pets are not permitted inside the museum grounds.  You may bring food and drink to the Kings Garden lawn area.  \r\n\r\nAfter-Tournament Party: At my house in Addison, VT (10 miles east of the Champlain Bridge), beginning about an hour after clean up at the fort is finished (best guess: 4-ish).  All fencers and their families\/ guests are invited.    No disposable place settings will be provided (in an attempt to be more environmental).  VFA fencers should bring their own place setting.  I have enough for guests from other clubs.  Bring food and drinks for a potluck dinner\/picnic\/barbecue.  Gas grill is available plus the usual kitchen stuff.  If you wish to purchase food on the way to my house (instead of having it sitting in your hot car all day), there is a Walmart at the corner of Routes 9N and 22 in Ticonderoga as well as the Ticonderoga Natural Foods Coop on Montcalm St (center of town).  In addition, there is Pratt's Store in Bridport  (intersection of routes 125 and 22A) if coming by the Ti ferry, or the West Addison General Store and Addison 4 Corner Store if coming by the Crown Pt bridge.  Pratt's has a deli and a decent range of general groceries, and the Addison store has a deli and makes pizza on some nights.  \r\n\r\nDirections from Fort Ti to my house:  exit the fort, turn left and follow Fort Rd to Route 22.  Go right on 22 and follow it to the traffic light\/intersection with Route 9N (Wal-Mart is to your left).  Turn right onto Route 9N and follow it through Crown Point.  At sign for \"Bridge to Vermont\" turn right and drive 4 miles to the bridge.  On the other side of the lake, bear left onto Route 17.  Drive about 7.5 miles to junction with Route 22A (Addison 4 Corner Store on your left).  Go another 0.9 miles and turn right onto Mountain Rd.  Drive 1.4 miles and my house is on the left - red house with wooden mailbox, 1379 Mountain Rd, Addison.   Parking:pull into driveway, or park along east side of road (the side my house is on).  Please do not block the left hand garage door if you get there before me, I'll need to pull my car in there when I arrive. \r\n\r\nEmail me if you have any questions.  I look forward to seeing you all this weekend for some fencing fun in the sun!\r\nViveka Fox\r\nvfox@gmavt.net\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fort Ticonderoga","address":"102 Fort Ti Rd","city":"Ticonderoga","state":"NY","zip":"12883","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":43.841725,"longitude":-73.3879248,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":82,"name":"Green Mountain","abbrev":"GRMT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":204481,"tournament_id":52613,"tournament":"25th Semi-Annual Ticonderoga Challenge","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-27T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":204483,"tournament_id":52613,"tournament":"25th Semi-Annual Ticonderoga Challenge","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":25,"prereg_count":29,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-05-27T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":207737,"tournament_id":52613,"tournament":"25th Semi-Annual Ticonderoga Challenge","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":52881,"name":"NJFA - E & Under Mixed Epee","start_date":"2023-05-27","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2023-02-17","prereg_close":"2023-05-26","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":20,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"This event is sanctioned by the USFA's NJ Division. \r\n\r\nYou must be born in 2009 or before to compete in this event. \r\n\r\n** If there are more than 6 participants of each gender, separate men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events will be held.
