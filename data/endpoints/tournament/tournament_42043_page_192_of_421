It is for beginners to get a taste of tournament competition. To be eligible for the novice a fencer must have been fencing less than one year! For example: A fencer who has fenced and\/or competed in epee or sabre for a couple of years but only recently picked up a foil is not a novice. This is for fencers who have very little tournament experience and for their parents.\r\n\r\nCompetitive USFA membership is not required for the novice event. We do require the $5.00 non-competitive membership for the Novice events. Those memberships may be taken at the door.\r\n\r\nThe conductive foil bib is not required for novice foil.\r\n\r\nBefore registration in the novice competition begins, there will be an introductory talk with the fencers and parents to walk them through various aspects of tournament fencing.\r\n\r\nThe novice event may be broken into separate events based upon age and size, at the discretion of the tournament organizers, at the time of the tournament. The novice event(s) format will be determined by the tournament organizers at the time of the competition. Novice events may be round-robin pools only or pools plus direct elimination.\r\n\r\n<b>Diversions:<\/b>\r\nHere is a list of links for things to do in Galveston on Setember 29th when you are not fencing.\r\n\r\n<b>Texas Seaport Museum \/ The Tall Ship, Elissa<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonhistory.org\/Texas_Seaport_Museum.asp\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pleasurepier\/\r\n\r\n<b>Moody Gardens<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.moodygardens.com\/attractions\/\r\n\r\n<b>Schlitterbahn<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.schlitterbahn.com\/gal\/\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Railroad Museum<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonrrmuseum.com\/\r\n\r\n<b>Lone Star Flight Museum<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.lsfm.org\/\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Duck Tours:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/ducktours\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pier 21 Theater:<\/b> (Three different films: The Great Storm, Galveston-Gateway to the Gulf; and The Pirate Island of Jean Laffite) http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pier21theatre\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pirates!

Being a tourist town, Galveston hotels run the gamut. Of really nice hotels close to the venue there are two that jump out:\r\n \r\nThe Tremont House \r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSTH\/main.wnt?cid=14807\r\n \r\nThe Hotel Galvez\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSHG\/main.wnt?cid=14749\r\n \r\nBoth are \"historic\" hotels operated by Wyndham. Tremont is in the Historic Strand District. The Galvez is on the beach. Neither is quite five minutes from the venue.\r\n \r\nFurther down Seawall Blvd, facing the Gulf of Mexico are three hotels, side by side, offering different price points, as they say. All three face the sea. Most of your drive to the venue would be along Seawall Blvd. from either of these three. It can be a bit busy on a weekend, but you do have the Gulf of Mexico on the right side pretty much 90%\r\nof the way, which can make up for it. In \"high traffic times\" allow fifteen minutes to reach the venue.\r\n \r\nThe San Luis http:\/\/www.sanluisresort.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Hilton http:\/\/www.galvestonhilton.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Holiday Inn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/holidayinnresorts\/hotels\/us\/en\/galveston\/glssb\/hoteldetail\r\n \r\nOne other option that is different but might be fun is Harbor House,which is located along the Galveston Waterfront (near the cruise ship terminals and the waterfront restaurants).\r\nhttp:\/\/www.harborhousepier21.com\/ \r\n","venue":{"name":"O'Connell College Preparatory School

If you pay at the door, the fees will be triple.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I pre-register and pay later?\r\nA: Yes.  Pre-register on AskFRED like you normally would, but skip the payment screen.

End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region. Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS.  Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List.   Each participant gets Region 3 points at this RYC.  The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in.  If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count  towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking.    RYC tournaments will award points to all participants. See the regional guidelines for point allocations at (http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6318\/Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative__1_.pdf).  Allocations depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement.   At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.   These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS. \r\n<b>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b> Cobra Youth Tournament Series<\/b>.

You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: Y8 and Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touches, 2 periods of 3 minutes each. The first period ends when 3 minutes have elapsed or one fencer scores 5 touches, whichever comes first. Y12 direct elimination bouts are now 15 touches, 3 periods of 3 minutes each -- just like Y14 and senior DE bouts.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2003-2006\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1999-2002\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=23846\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/04\/2013\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

It is free on Sunday, right next to the club, and we need to keep the club's lot open for our neighbors. Thank you!\r\n\r\nThis is a non-USFA event that is both a fundraiser for the Central Coast Fencing Foundation (www.centralcoastfencing.org) and a chance to have fun competing with and against your fellow fencers. \r\n\r\nCompetitive USFA memberships are not required. However, you will need at least a Non-competitive membership to compete. See usfencing.org for more information on the membership levels and to sign up online.\r\n\r\nTeams don't have to be from the Central Coast - we'd love to have anyone come who wants to have a great time fencing.\r\n\r\nFor foil, we won't require the lame bib (so any non-foilists can make a team if they want) but that will negatively affect your handicap...\r\n\r\nTeams are made up of 3 (or 4, if you want an alternate) fencers. \r\n\r\nTeams will be handicapped based on ratings to help even the field and ensure a chance for any team.\r\n\r\nTeams will be seeded into pools, and then the top two teams will fence for glory...without the handicap!\r\n\r\nNote: Teams can be but are not required to be mixed gender.\r\n\r\nCost: $30 per team\r\n\r\nThere will also be a raffle to win free entry into the Central Coast's premier event, the SLO Open! All fencers will get a ticket for entering. Additional tickets can be purchased for $1, or earned by feats of fencing prowess!\r\n\r\nPlease preregister your team so we know how many teams to expect!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Presidio Fencing Club","address":"216 East Cota Street","city":"Santa Barbara","state":"CA","zip":"93101","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":34.420257,"longitude":-119.69369,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":10,"name":"Southern California","abbrev":"SOCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":93221,"tournament_id":23138,"tournament":"Central Coast Team Tournament 2013","full_name":"Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-06T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":93222,"tournament_id":23138,"tournament":"Central Coast Team Tournament 2013","full_name":"Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-06T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":93223,"tournament_id":23138,"tournament":"Central Coast Team Tournament 2013","full_name":"Mixed Team Saber","short_name":"MxSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-06T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":23916,"name":"Bay Cup at COAST: Y10WS, Y12WS","start_date":"2013-10-06","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2013-09-10","prereg_close":"2013-10-05","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is a Bay Cup tournament.
