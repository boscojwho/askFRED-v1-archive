Both events will be held at Rain City Fencing Center on Sunday December 18th as follows:\r\n\r\n1pm - Junior Men's Epee\r\n3pm - Cadet Men's Epee\r\n\r\nFencers competing at the above events will need to pay an additional $10 IN CASH at the tournament this weekend to cover the cost of hiring referees.\r\n\r\nAll of the other events do not need to be fenced and the people registered for them will automatically qualify.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nFencers who want to fence at JOs in February must qualify at this event unless they have sufficient national or regional points. In each event, the top 25% (rounded up) will qualify for JOs, with a minimum of 3.  Therefore, if 3 or fewer fencers are registered for an event, the event will not be fenced and all will qualify.\r\n\r\nFencers that earn qualification at the Junior events will automatically for the corresponding Cadet event if they are age-eligible.\r\n\r\nWe are implementing the same process for JO Qualifiers that we have used the past few years.  This process will save everyone time and money.  Please read the following carefully.\r\n\r\nFirst, all entries must be pre-registered and paid on AskFred by 11:59 PM on December 11th.  NO ENTRIES WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE ENTRY DEADLINE.\r\n\r\nAfter the entry deadline, we will send an email announcing the following:\r\n\r\nIf an event has 3 or fewer fencers that are not already qualified, the event will not be fenced.  All of the fencers that are registered will be considered qualified.\r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, we will announce where and when the event will be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Entry Fees ---------\r\nAll fencers must pay the mandatory $10 registration fee when they sign up on AskFred.  \r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, each fencer will need to pay an ADDITIONAL $10 in CASH on the day of the event (to cover the cost of hiring referees.)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Tournament Rules -------- \r\nCadet events are open to fencers born in 2006-2009.\r\nJunior events are open to fencers born in 2003-2009.\r\n\r\nSince this is a national qualifier, all competitors must be current members of the USFA Western Washington Division and US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n \r\nPlease join or renew your USFA membership online at https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/membership prior to registering on AskFred.\r\n\r\nFor events that are fenced, full USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks.

Iowa Division fencers who want to participate in Junior Olympics in Denver in February 2023.\r\n\r\nWe will fence any events with 4 or more people signed up, but we do not anticipate that there will be that many fencers in any one age\/gender\/weapon category. If we do not need to fence the event, all fencers preregistered will be submitted to the national office as JO qualifiers.\r\n\r\nFencers MUST be preregistered by Dec. 15th - no entries will be accepted at the door.\r\n\r\nFinal schedule (if we need to fence any events) will be announced after close of preregistration on 12\/15\/21.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Foil\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Saber\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Foil\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Saber\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Epee\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Foil\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Saber\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Epee\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Foil\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Saber\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing membership (Access, competitive, or collegiate) required.\r\n\r\nYes, RDF is also running unsanctioned JR and CDT events that day, which are NOT qualifiers.

The start of cadet events may be slightly delayed if some fencers are still competing in the junior events.\r\n\r\nAll times are also subject to change based on the actual number of preregistrations. Please pay attention to the scheduling changes notifications.\r\n\r\nIn each event, the top 25% (rounded up) will qualify for JOs, with a minimum of 3. If 3 or fewer fencers show up for an event, the event will not be fenced and all will qualify. Since this event qualifies based on number of people there will be a fence off for the last qualifying place if two people finish at that place.\r\n\r\nFencers that earn qualification at the Junior events will automatically for the corresponding Cadet event (if age-eligible.)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Registration Information ---------\r\nEntry fees: registration fee is $15 plus $40 per event entered. Fees will NOT be refunded if an event is not fenced because everyone automatically qualifies.\r\n\r\nPayment: Please prepay on AskFRED \r\n\r\nAll fees are doubled at the door if a fencer did not preregister.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to qualify for both Junior and Cadet should register and pay for both events. If you qualify for Junior and therefore do not need to fence the Cadet event, we will refund your Cadet event entry fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Tournament Rules --------\r\nCheck this page for age eligibility requirements.\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nSince this is a national qualifier, all competitors must be current members of the USAFencing CENTRAL CALIFORNIA DIVISION and US citizens or permanent residents. Please bring passport, Green Card or birth certificate that proves your residency status.\r\n\r\nPlease join or renew your USAFencing membership online at\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/\r\nprior

For more information, see Table 2.6.3.1\"\r\n\r\n\"1.2 DIVISION AFFILIATION\r\nA member can declare a division affiliation based on their residence, location of the school that member is attending or location of the primary club that the member will represent in USA Fencing competitions. Each fencing season, a member must declare the division affiliation for that membership year. That division is the one from which the fencer must qualify to the USA Fencing National\r\nChampionships. The member may request a change in division if they move to a new geographic location (permanent residence or school) or select a primary club which is located in a different division, and notifies the National Office in writing of the new address and division change request.\" \r\n\r\n\"2.6 GENERAL QUALIFYING INFORMATION\r\n2.6.1 Division Qualifiers\r\nDivision qualifiers are competitions in which a specified number of fencers, based on their results, qualify to the USA Fencing National Championships and the Junior Olympic Championships.\r\nDivision qualifiers are restricted to members of the division for the following events: Y14, Div II and Div III (USA Fencing National Championships) and Cadet and Junior (JOs). Veteran fencers can qualify for USA Fencing National Championships via Di- vision II or Division III division qualifiers. Division qualifying tournaments cannot be mixed gender competitions. Fencers who have earned national points are the only athletes who will be skipped over in the results to determine qualifying athletes. Athletes who have already qualified via a regional path will not be skipped over.\r\nFencers must be U.S. citizens or Permanent Res- idents. Athletes that have represented another country in the last three years at FIE-level compe- titions (Veteran\/Senior\/Junior and those athletes that represented another country in the Cadet World Championships) are not eligible to compete in a National Championship, unless the athlete has been officially approved by the FIE to represent the USA. A foreign fencer who is in the United States on a visa is NOT eligible to fence in any National Championships, individual or team, or associated division qualifying competitions.\"\r\n\r\nFull Athlete Packet can be found here: https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/athlete-handbook\r\n\r\nAs this is a qualifying event, we cannot estimate the number of fencers that will register at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Patten Gymnasium Northwestern University","address":"2407 Sheridan Rd.","city":"Evanston","state":"IL","zip":"60208","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":42.0611052,"longitude":-87.6765988,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":201279,"tournament_id":51700,"tournament":"IL.
