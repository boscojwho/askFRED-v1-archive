If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87623,"tournament_id":21419,"tournament":"FAP Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":19,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-12T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22188,"name":"Duel d'Abdul 2013","start_date":"2013-05-12","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2013-04-02","prereg_close":"2013-05-10","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"<b>Welcome to the 2013 Duel d'Abdul!<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Sunday May 12th, 2013<\/b>\r\nY12 Mixed Epee starts at 10:00am\r\nSenior Mixed Epee (Open) starts at 12:00pm\r\nEntry Fee $30 with pre-registration, $40 at the door.\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on Friday, 05\/10\/2013\r\n\r\n<b>Prizes for top place finishers!<\/b>\r\nSenior Mixed Open: Gift Certificates for Fencing Gear\r\n1st place - $100 value\r\n2nd place - $50 value \r\n3rd place - $30 value (fence off for 3rd)\r\nTop female place - $30 value\r\n\r\nY12 Mixed: Gift Certificates for Fencing Gear\r\n1st place - $40 value\r\n2nd place - $30 value\r\n3rd place - $20 value (fence off for 3rd)\r\nTop female place - $30 value\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info, visit www.eastbayfencers.com\r\nDirections to EBFG: http:\/\/eastbayfencers.com\/directions","venue":{"name":"East Bay Fencers Gym","address":"1429 Martin Luther King Jr Way","city":"Oakland","state":"CA","zip":"94612","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.8067348,"longitude":-122.2757964,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":6,"name":"Northern California","abbrev":"NORCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":90347,"tournament_id":22188,"tournament":"Duel d'Abdul 2013","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":37,"prereg_count":49,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-12T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":90348,"tournament_id":22188,"tournament":"Duel d'Abdul 2013","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-12T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19885,"name":"Bay Cup @ PenFA: Y14MF5; JMF5","start_date":"2013-05-12","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2012-09-08","prereg_close":"2013-05-11","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is a Bay Cup tournament.
