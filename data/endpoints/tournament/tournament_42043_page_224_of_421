If an event exceeds 80 fencers, it may be necessary to do a cut after the pool round. This will be announced after the registration deadline, once the number of attendees is known. \r\n\r\nPrizes will be awarded to the top 4 finishers in the senior and veteran events.  Medals will be awarded to the top 8 finishers in all events.\r\n\r\n---------- Registration Information ----------\r\n\r\nBy Midnight October 12, 2014:\r\n- $30 registration fee\r\n- $30 per senior event\r\n- $20 per veteran event\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTICE:  IF YOU DO NOT COMPLETE YOUR REGISTRATION (IE REGISTER AND PAY), ALL FEES WILL DOUBLE.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-NORTH","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108104,"tournament_id":27324,"tournament":"FAP-North E Sabre & E Epee","full_name":"EUnder Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"E-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-25T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108110,"tournament_id":27324,"tournament":"FAP-North E Sabre & E Epee","full_name":"EUnder Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"E-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-25T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27351,"name":"Turtle Race Foil","start_date":"2014-10-25","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2014-08-19","prereg_close":"2014-10-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"REGISTRATION IS NOW CLOSED DUE TO SPACE LIMITATIONS\r\n\r\nTournament fee: $35 for each event\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nE & Under Women's Foil\r\nE & Under Men's Foil\r\nMixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/19\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/24\/2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Hunter College HS","address":"71 East 94th St.","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10128","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7856758,"longitude":-73.9540837,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108142,"tournament_id":27351,"tournament":"Turtle Race Foil","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":25,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-25T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108143,"tournament_id":27351,"tournament":"Turtle Race Foil","full_name":"EUnder Men's Foil","short_name":"E-MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":15,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-25T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108144,"tournament_id":27351,"tournament":"Turtle Race Foil","full_name":"EUnder Women's Foil","short_name":"E-WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-25T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27103,"name":"2014 Virginia Division Junior Olympic Qualifiers","start_date":"2014-10-25","end_date":"2014-10-26","comments":"This is the 2014 Virginia Division qualifier tourney to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and is also the VA DIV Junior and Cadet Championship event. $35 if you're registered here, $70 if you're not.","prereg_open":"2014-08-08","prereg_close":"2014-10-24","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is the 2014 Virginia Division qualifier tourney to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and is also the VA DIV Junior and Cadet Championship event. $35 per event if registered on AskFred, $70 per event if not.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Epee\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Foil\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Saber\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Epee\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Foil\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Saber\r\n\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Foil\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Saber\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Foil\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Saber\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nJunior (U20) events will be held before the Cadet events on the same day.\r\n\r\nVA Division Members Only!!!

Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience and thank you for your patience. as always FAP is committed to providing a positive tournament experience for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.  \r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA DIVISION IS MAKING A PUSH TO DEVELOP NEW REFEREES this season.  Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"1st District Plaza 3801 Market Street","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9571302,"longitude":-75.1984219,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108107,"tournament_id":27326,"tournament":"FAP Div3 Sabre PLEASE NOTE CHANGE OF VENUE","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-10-26T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28099,"name":"2014 RIFAC Pumpkin Smash!","start_date":"2014-10-26","end_date":"","comments":"This tournament is open to RIFAC members only.","prereg_open":"2014-10-02","prereg_close":"2014-10-25","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"YOUTH EVENTS (see age chart below)\r\n\r\nSunday, October 26, 2014\r\n\r\nY10 Foil 10:00\r\n\r\nY14 Epee 12:00\r\n\r\nY14 Foil 1:00\r\n\r\nY14 Saber 3:00\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistration\r\n\r\nThis tournament is for RIFAC fencers only.\r\n\r\nEvents will be separated for boys\/girls when numbers permit.

RJCCs are a group of events throughout the country for fencers in the junior and cadet age categories in all six weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn national RJCC points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families. This RJCC will provide a qualifying path for Junior Olympics. National RJCC Points will be awarded to those fencers placing in the top 40% of the competitive field regardless of where the cut occurs. Fencers in the top 32 of this points list, who are not auto-qualifiers, will be qualified for Junior Olympics. \r\n\r\nThe Athlete\u0092s Handbook:(http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698380-athlete-handbook) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for summer nationals and should be used as the appropriate reference document.\r\nSeeding:\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating and points standing are correct with the USFA, and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Current-Membership-Listing\r\nCurrent points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Athlete-Info\/Rankings\/Current-Rankings.aspx\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined USFA Letter Ranking with year classification. Athletes of the same classification\/year will be seeded randomly within their criteria. \r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA.

Make sure not to block any driveways or fire hydrants or your car may be towed.\r\n\r\nCheck-In\r\n\r\nFollow the signs for event entry to the entrance from the driveway off Village Park Road. The check in table will be just inside this door. Automated bar code check-in will be used so you MUST have your USFA membership card with you. Swipe your card to check-in for your event. Check-in for each event will be open one hour before the event. You must check-in for each event you are entered in when fencing more than one event.  Proceed down the hall to the main fencing gym where you can store your bag.\r\n\r\nBag and Equipment Storage\r\n\r\nIn the main fencing gym there are two areas for bag storage. Along the back wall there is a bag storage railing similar to what you may have seen at Mission Fencing. Bags stored here are to be placed on end behind the railing.  Bags may also be stored underneath the bleachers. The bags are to be slid in end first perpendicular with the bleachers.  Follow these procedures and there is storage for over 170 bags at any one time.  Bags left in the walking aisles will be removed by security to a central location. Do not bring your bag to the strip; bring only your spare weapons and body cords and water\/sports drink.\r\n\r\nWeapons\/Equipment Check\r\n\r\nBody cords, masks, lames, and gloves will be checked as per normal USFA qualifying tournament rules.  The armorers running the equipment checks will be at the end of the central hallway. To maintain good traffic flow, proceed down the left side of the hallway and return to the fencing area on the right. There will be a divider in the hallway to help guide you.  The armorers are there to test equipment, not to make repairs.  There will be a commercial armorer on site for your repair needs.\r\n\r\nStrip Procedure for Fencers, Coaches, and Spectators\r\n\r\nFencers shall hook up to and unhook from the reels at the end of the strip whether using a box reel or overhead reel system.  All those not actually fencing (coaches, spectators and waiting fencers) shall remain behind the warning zone of the strip.  Referees will be instructed to award cards to any who refuse to heed this rule.\r\n\r\nFood\r\n\r\nThere will be food served in the side fencing gym and pro shop area. Please keep your eating in this area, or outdoors. Don\u0092t bring sandwiches into the fencing gums and in near the fencing strips.  Help keep the venue clean and make your contribution to a fun event.\r\n\r\nPro-Shop \r\n\r\nDid your mask fail the punch test? Did you forget your socks? Need a new glove or a fresh lame?  Break a blade?  Our Absolute Fencing Pro-Shop will be open in case you need to replace equipment, or add to your collection.  http:\/\/www.absolutefencinggear.com\/ \r\n\r\nEquipment Repairs\r\n\r\nThere will be a professional armorer on duty at the facility to make repairs to your equipment, whether it\u0092s a body cord fix or an adjustment to your epee springs. Get it taken care of by Douglas Hahn of http:\/\/www.fencingarmor.com\/\r\n\r\nOther Services\r\n\r\nMonica Hahn of Fencography will be on hand documenting the event.
