You can get an entry form at www.fencingclub.org , which can be mailed or brought with you to the tournament.\r\n\r\nEvents will be held in three age groups: Y10, Y12 and Y14, where Y14 represents fencers ages 14 and younger.  Those competing in Y10 must be over the age of 7.   Age is determined as of January 1st of the competitive season (August 1st through July 31st).\r\n\r\nAll three weapons will be fenced in each age classification.\r\n\r\nEvents will be separated by age and gender whenever possible.  When events are combined, separate awards will be given for male and female competitors.  Awards will be given to first through third place, with no fence-off for the bronze medal.\r\n\r\nY10 fencers must use blades designated a \"0\" or \"2\" under the internationally recognized lengths.   Weapon length will be tested prior to competition.  Masks will be tested prior to competition.  An armorer will be available to test lames and weapons prior to competition.  Fencers are responsible for making sure all equipment conforms to USFA specifications.  Weapons will be tested on the strip.  At the end of each bout, fencers are required to sign pool sheets and DE slips before leaving the strip.  USFA rules will be enforced throughout the competition.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be USFA members.  If you are not a USFA member, forms will be available at the tournament.  If you do not have your USFA card with you when checking in, you will be required to complete a new USFA form and pay the annual fee.  The form and payment will be returned to you upon proof of USFA membership subsequent to the tournament.\r\n\r\nTournament format will be pools to five points, used to establish seeding to the direct elimination (DE).  DE  bouts will be conducted as they are at a NAC.  For Y10 and Y12, the winner of the DE bouts is the best 2 out of 3 five-touch bouts.  For Y14, the DE bouts are 15 touches (three 3-minute periods, with a 1-minute rest between periods).\r\n\r\nBox lunches will be available for sale at the tournament on Saturday at a price of $6 per box lunch.

If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at Division qualifier if the fencer is on the Youth 14 point standings. There is a group of fencers who have pre-qualified (i.e., automatic qualifiers). In that group are those who are on the Cadet point standings on January 18, 2005 or in the top 8 of the Youth 14 point standings on Jan. 1. If one has not met either of those standards, then the fencer must have fenced in his or her division\u0092s qualifying competition and placed in the top 25% of the field of fencers for that event.<br \/>\r\nAs a result of action at the Board meeting Oct. 2, 2004, for Junior Olympic Championships a fencer who has qualified for Under-20 Championships in a specific weapon then becomes qualified for Under-17 Championships in that weapon if the fencer is age eligible for Under-17.<br>\r\nFor the Under-20 J.O. Championships, fencers must be born between 1985 and 1991. If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at Division qualifier if the fencer is on the Cadet point standings. Pre-qualifiers for the Junior Championships are those on the Junior point standings as of Jan. 18, 2005 or in the top 16 in the Cadet point standings as of Jan. 18. Otherwise, the fencers must qualify from their Division qualifying competition by placing in the top 25% of the field.<br>\r\n<br>\r\nEntry Fees:<br>\r\n$15.00 per event (cash or check) - make checks payable to South Texas Division.

A qualified fencer must also submit a timely entry to the JO Championships.\r\nFor the Under-17 Junior Olympic Championships, fencers must be born between 1988 and 1991. If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at Division qualifier if the fencer is on the Youth 14 point standings.

In that group are those who are on the Cadet point standings on January 18, 2005 or in the top 8 of the Youth 14 point standings on Jan. 1. If one has not met either of those standards, then the fencer must have fenced in his or her division\u0092s qualifying competition and placed in the top 25% of the field of fencers for that event.\r\nAs a result of action at the Board meeting Oct. 2, 2004, for Junior Olympic Championships a fencer who has qualified for Under-20 Championships in a specific weapon then becomes qualified for Under-17 Championships in that weapon if the fencer is age eligible for Under-17.\r\nFor the Under-20 J.O. Championships, fencers must be born between 1985 and 1991. If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at Division qualifier if the fencer is on the Cadet point standings. Pre-qualifiers for the Junior Championships are those on the Junior point standings as of Jan. 18, 2005 or in the top 16 in the Cadet point standings as of Jan. 18. Otherwise, the fencers must qualify from their Division qualifying competition by placing in the top 25% of the field.\r\n\r\nEntry Fees:\r\n$15.00 per event (cash or check) - make checks payable to North Texas Division.
