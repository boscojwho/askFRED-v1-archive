Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 6 PM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter. Traffic going south to Tacoma can be heavy at that time because housing in Pierce County is much more affordable than in King County so please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED. $25 per fencer at the door. Credit card payment will incur a $2 surcharge.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $15 to use it for the night which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear for the new season.\r\n\r\n<b>------------------ Tournament Rules -------------------<\/b> \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event.

No jeans or sweatpants allowed. A foil mask with conductive bib and mask cord are required. Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/31\/16. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 8\/31\/16) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into <b>Novice<\/b> (1 year of fencing experience or less) and <b>Intermediate<\/b> (3 years of fencing experience or less) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2004-2009) and Senior (2003 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Novice Level events will be seeded at Random. Intermediate events will be seeded utilizing the Intermediate Series Points list. Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 12 attendees)\r\n3:00 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 12 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\n<b>The purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:<\/b>\r\n<ul><li>Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament<ul><li>signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n<li>what to bring to a tournament<\/ul><\/ul><ul><li>Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols <ul><li>registration <li>the importance of warming up<li>saluting opponents and referees<li>keeping score on a pool sheet\r\n<li>how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round<li>good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates)<li>shaking hands during the awards ceremony<li>not using a flash while taking pictures<li>appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?<\/ul><\/ul><ul><li>Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n<li>Show basic referee hand signals\r\n<li>Train new referees and bout committee <\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>The purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to<\/b>:<ul><li>Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n<li>Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n<li>Introduce fencers to complete armoury inspection\r\n<li>Explain how to properly maintain one\u0092s equipment\r\n<li>Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n<li>Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists<\/ul>\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nWe will hold six of these between August 2016 and June 2017, and the points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes).

This format is designed to assist youth to have a fuller learning experience at fencing tournaments and to address youth events that have had historically low turnouts. The format involves fencers as volunteer mentors to assist in creating bouting opportunities for youth with the goal of developing a stronger local field of youth fencers. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nDESF Practice Round Robins: These events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability. These events are sponsored by DESF as practice events for new fencers, or fencers who are fencing for fitness and enjoyment.

The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USA Fencing Events will be awarded according to USA Fencing tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Fencing Flea Market:\r\nDESF will provide tables for a flea market for fencing equipment. Fencers are welcome to bring used or new equipment they wish to trade, sell or donate. Price your own items, or John will be available to help you price any used equipment if you need assistance. Please ensure that the equipment you sell is clean and in good shape. If you are not sure if your used equipment is in good condition, bring it anyway, and we can evaluate its condition. Important: Please provide contact information (name, telephone, e-mail) at the table, so that buyers may be in touch with sellers. Many new fencers may be looking to purchase used equipment for the first time. Contact information is important in case the buyer will want to contact the seller directly.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

Membership\r\nexceptions for foreign fencers do apply. Athletes without proof of membership must complete\r\ncompetitive membership registration prior to competing.\r\nParents\/guardians should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age\r\nneeds verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to\r\ninformation@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nTo avoid bringing this documentation, USA Fencing has an age verification process.\r\nCurrent Verification Process:\r\nAn athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via\r\nemail (information@usfencing.org), mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the\r\ndatabase. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and\r\ntemporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nSEEDING:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\nSeeding should be based on the following order:\r\n&#61623; National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n&#61623; Classification and year\r\n&#61623; If athlete has neither National Points nor a weapon classification they are seeded on a random\r\nbasis with the other athletes in the same situation\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nSeeding should be based on the following order:\r\n&#61623; Current National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n&#61623; Classification and year\r\n&#61623; Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who\r\nare seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nPOINTS:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\n\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will\r\nearn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn\r\nregional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn\r\nqualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For more information on this Regional Points formula\r\nsee the Regional Recognition Initiative Document available http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources\r\nUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional Rank\r\neach season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior\r\ntournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional\r\npoints do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an\r\nolder age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as\r\nwell. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet,\r\nhe\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events.\r\nJunior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are also only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and\r\nJunior Olympic\/National Championships. \r\n\r\nRYC:\r\n\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RYC is\r\nheld will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their\r\nregion will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A\r\npercentage of athletes (Y12\/Y14) will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For\r\nmore information on this Regional Points formula see the Regional Recognition Initiative\r\nDocument available on http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources.\r\nUp to the best 3 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional\r\nRank each season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional\r\nYouth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12\r\nregional points do NOT trickle down to Y10).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer\r\nqualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn\r\nqualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the National\r\nChampionships in Y14 and is age eligible for Y12, he\/she will also qualify in Y12)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RYC events.\r\n(Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC\r\nto a maximum of 64 fencers and, depending on the size of the competitive field, to the top 32\r\nor 64 fencers (depending on field size) at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\n\r\nThe RJCC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Cadet and Junior fencers to the Junior Olympic\r\nNational Championships and the USA Fencing Summer Nationals July Challenge.\r\nA percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National\r\nChampionships and for the Junior Olympic Championships in Junior and Cadet.\r\nFor more information on Cadet and Junior qualification paths refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook and the qualification table available under the \u0093Qualification\u0094\r\ntab on the RJCC resources page at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjccresources.\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\n\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth\r\nNAC and for Y10\/12 and 14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\nA percentage of regional point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer\r\nNational Championships in Y12 and Y14. For more information on Youth\r\nQualification paths refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook\r\nand the qualification table available under the \u0093Qualification\u0094 tab on the RJCC resources page:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjccresources.\r\nOrganizers are responsible for being able to answer questions from the membership\r\nconcerning Regional Points and Qualification at their tournament.\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament\r\nprior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be\r\nconsidered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the\r\nregular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the\r\nYouth NAC.

Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 1 PM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter. \r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED. $25 per fencer at the door. Credit card payment will incur a $2 surcharge.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We hope that all the working epees are not left handed. We will charge you $15 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. All the weapons will likely fail the shims test so you are more than welcome to repair our club epees for us. Perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear for the new season.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2016-2017 season. You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks.

Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. No classification or affiliation changes will be made at the event. Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.

Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during tournament: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n====================================\r\nTOURNAMENT PREPARATION GUIDES\r\n====================================\r\nThese guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments.\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html (courtesy of fencing.net)\r\nParents Guide to Fencing: http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html (courtesy of Fencing.net)\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n====================================\r\nABOUT COBRA FENCING CLUB\r\n====================================\r\nLocated at: 629 Grove Street; Jersey City, NJ (http:\/\/www.cobrafencing.com)\r\n\r\nSteve Kaplan - Club owner\/Coach \r\n\u0095 (U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Fencing Master)\r\n\u0095 1976 U.S. Olympic Team Member \u0096 Sabre.\r\n\u0095 1975 Pan American Games Silver Medalist.\r\n\u0095 4 time U.S. National Team Champion.\r\n\u0095 1971 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All American \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Varsity Head Fencing Coach NYU 1980-1986.\r\n\u0095 Elected to NYU Athletic Hall of Fame 1996.\r\n\u0095 Founded Cobra Fencing Club in 2002.\r\n\r\nDemetrios \u0093Mitro\u0094 Valsamis \u0096 Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 Under-19 U.S. Foil Champion 1979, 1980.\r\n\u0095 Cadet Sabre Champion 1976, 1977.\r\n\u0095 1983 NCAA Foil Champion \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Foil Coach at Cobra since 2003.\r\n\r\nRaskyrie (Ras) Davidson - Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 2005, 2006, 2007 United States Junior World Team Member\r\n\u0095 2006 World Cadet Saber Bronze Medalist\r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Cadet Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Junior Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2004 United States National Cadet Saber Champion\r\n\r\nCobra Fencing Club is a member of the NJ Division of USA Fencing (http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org). \r\nSince Cobra\u0092s inception it has sought to foster the development of youth fencing.

During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Seeding for SYC pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. Seeding for CADET pool round will use National Cadet ranking within classification, then classification\/year. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. No classification or affiliation changes will be made at the event. Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.

Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during tournament: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n====================================\r\nTOURNAMENT PREPARATION GUIDES\r\n====================================\r\nThese guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments.\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html (courtesy of fencing.net)\r\nParents Guide to Fencing: http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html (courtesy of Fencing.net)\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n====================================\r\nABOUT COBRA FENCING CLUB\r\n====================================\r\nLocated at: 629 Grove Street; Jersey City, NJ (http:\/\/www.cobrafencing.com)\r\n\r\nSteve Kaplan - Club owner\/Coach \r\n\u0095 (U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Fencing Master)\r\n\u0095 1976 U.S. Olympic Team Member \u0096 Sabre.\r\n\u0095 1975 Pan American Games Silver Medalist.\r\n\u0095 4 time U.S. National Team Champion.\r\n\u0095 1971 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All American \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Varsity Head Fencing Coach NYU 1980-1986.\r\n\u0095 Elected to NYU Athletic Hall of Fame 1996.\r\n\u0095 Founded Cobra Fencing Club in 2002.\r\n\r\nDemetrios \u0093Mitro\u0094 Valsamis \u0096 Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 Under-19 U.S. Foil Champion 1979, 1980.\r\n\u0095 Cadet Sabre Champion 1976, 1977.\r\n\u0095 1983 NCAA Foil Champion \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Foil Coach at Cobra since 2003.\r\n\r\nRaskyrie (Ras) Davidson - Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 2005, 2006, 2007 United States Junior World Team Member\r\n\u0095 2006 World Cadet Saber Bronze Medalist\r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Cadet Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Junior Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2004 United States National Cadet Saber Champion\r\n\r\nCobra Fencing Club is a member of the NJ Division of USA Fencing (http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org). \r\nSince Cobra\u0092s inception it has sought to foster the development of youth fencing.

Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. Seeding for CADET pool round will use National Cadet ranking within classification, then classification\/year. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. No classification or affiliation changes will be made at the event. Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.

Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during tournament: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n====================================\r\nTOURNAMENT PREPARATION GUIDES\r\n====================================\r\nThese guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments.\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html (courtesy of fencing.net)\r\nParents Guide to Fencing: http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html (courtesy of Fencing.net)\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n====================================\r\nABOUT COBRA FENCING CLUB\r\n====================================\r\nLocated at: 629 Grove Street; Jersey City, NJ (http:\/\/www.cobrafencing.com)\r\n\r\nSteve Kaplan - Club owner\/Coach \r\n\u0095 (U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Fencing Master)\r\n\u0095 1976 U.S. Olympic Team Member \u0096 Sabre.\r\n\u0095 1975 Pan American Games Silver Medalist.\r\n\u0095 4 time U.S. National Team Champion.\r\n\u0095 1971 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All American \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Varsity Head Fencing Coach NYU 1980-1986.\r\n\u0095 Elected to NYU Athletic Hall of Fame 1996.\r\n\u0095 Founded Cobra Fencing Club in 2002.\r\n\r\nDemetrios \u0093Mitro\u0094 Valsamis \u0096 Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 Under-19 U.S. Foil Champion 1979, 1980.\r\n\u0095 Cadet Sabre Champion 1976, 1977.\r\n\u0095 1983 NCAA Foil Champion \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Foil Coach at Cobra since 2003.\r\n\r\nRaskyrie (Ras) Davidson - Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 2005, 2006, 2007 United States Junior World Team Member\r\n\u0095 2006 World Cadet Saber Bronze Medalist\r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Cadet Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Junior Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2004 United States National Cadet Saber Champion\r\n\r\nCobra Fencing Club is a member of the NJ Division of USA Fencing (http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org). \r\nSince Cobra\u0092s inception it has sought to foster the development of youth fencing.

The team's total of won vs. lost bouts will determine the winner.\r\n\r\nRound up another fencer or two and form your team prior to the event start time at 1:00 pm Saturday, but if you do not have a team, you can show up and be put on a team.

Also, last year the cookies were awesome.\r\n\r\nIt will help if people can form and pre-register their teams ahead of time.  askfred.net doesn't have a mixed weapon option, so pretend that the team registration event is actually \"Three Weapon\", and not foil.  Pick out a team name, make sure you have at least 1 male and 1 female on your team, and figure out who is going to fence which weapon for you.  Then proceed to register the team on askfred.

Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement.

Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional points do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\n-\tThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well.
