We have the Leon Paul fencing mask inserts (compatible with all masks) available on site for $2.\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for most events instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when. We are taking and logging temperature.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14.

We have developed a comprehensive, state of the art plan for everyone participating in the Orlando Challenge to follow and are committed to keeping you informed of the steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to keep you safe. Without question, we want to provide our fencers with incredible and inspirational experiences; but we also want you safe when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here. This tournament is subject to Florida state laws and orders regarding COVID-19. We will adhere to such laws as they apply with changing circumstances. To such a purpose we are taking every step to keep everyone safe and have developed some Covid-19 guidelines, requirements and protocols. We ask that you read these carefully.\r\n\r\nHealth Measures\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Challenge venue counts with 24 touch-less hand sanitizer stations throughout the complex for your convenience.\r\nA state of the art health room with an athletic trainer on site during all events.\r\nTemperature Screening\r\nWhen anyone arrives at the Orlando Challenge, they must undergo and pass temperature screening using the CDC temperature recommendation.\r\nFace Coverings\r\n\r\nAnyone inside the venue must wear face coverings at all times. Attendees are not required to wear them while eating and drinking, or outside the venue.\r\nFace masks will be sold at the venue for anyone who may have forgotten theirs.\r\nPhysical Distancing\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Challenge is fortunate enough to have partnered with a remarkable venue, the Rosen Shingle Creek, this top of the line, enormous and luxurious venue exceeds all expectation for safety and guidelines.\r\nTo promote proper physical distancing during the tournament, we have signage and markings in the hallways to identify appropriate physical distancing.\r\nSeating areas, in our amazing venue, will be modified to maintain physical distancing while still providing a great view of the tournament.\r\nBeing a youth event, fencers may be accompanied by up to two individuals on strip (a parent\/guardian and\/or a coach) who will receive a special wristband per event.

The number of accompanying adults permitted inside the venue will depend on the situation at the particular time and the number of people in the venue. If the current health situation changes by the time the event happens, and more spectators are allowed to come, we will promptly notify all the registrants.\r\nWe ask that coaches and parents refrain from shouting or screaming at fencers in order to avoid the spread of any droplets or particles.\r\nCleaning & Sanitation To protect the health and safety of our guests sanitization of the building is cleaned and sanitized every day. The entire building, chairs, backboards, and common areas have been disinfected.

We have developed a comprehensive, state of the art plan for everyone participating in the Orlando Challenge to follow and are committed to keeping you informed of the steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to keep you safe. Without question, we want to provide our fencers with incredible and inspirational experiences; but we also want you safe when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here. This tournament is subject to Florida state laws and orders regarding COVID-19. We will adhere to such laws as they apply with changing circumstances. To such a purpose we are taking every step to keep everyone safe and have developed some Covid-19 guidelines, requirements and protocols. We ask that you read these carefully.\r\n\r\nHealth Measures\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Challenge venue counts with several touch-less hand sanitizer stations throughout the complex for your convenience.\r\nAthletic trainer on site during all events.\r\nWhen anyone arrives at the Orlando Challenge, they must undergo and pass temperature screening using the CDC temperature recommendation.\r\nFencers must wear appropriate attire that their fencing uniform can be put on over in public areas.

Our enormous venue is more than 110,000 square feet to provide proper social distancing.\r\nWe have spaced the event schedules to have 4 hours in between each block of events, we did this to ensure that no large crows gather at any moment (Not to mention to ensure that all events start and finish right on time).\r\nTo promote proper physical distancing during the tournament, we have signage and markings in the hallways to identify appropriate physical distancing.\r\nSeating areas, in our amazing venue, will be modified to maintain physical distancing while still providing a great view of the tournament.

We have the Leon Paul fencing mask inserts (compatible with all masks) available on site for $2.\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for most events instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway.

Poor behavior will not be tolerated from fencers, coaches or athletes.  Anyone displaying poor sportsmanship appropriately carded and will be asked to exit the building in accordance with USA Fencing Guidelines.\r\n\r\nDue to the current health crisis, we are requesting that fencers limit the spectators that come to watch.  We insist that anyone coming inside the building wear a mask and make use of the hand washing and sanitizing stations. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>USA FENCING GUIDELINES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY:\r\n\r\nMask Mandate<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll attendees at USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments will be required to wear a mask at all times, including athletes during competition. Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\n<b>Screaming<\/b>\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n<b>Handshakes<\/b>\r\n\r\nAthletes are to salute at the conclusion of a bout in lieu of shaking hands with each other, the referee or coaches.\r\n\r\n<b>Events Scheduled:\r\nUnrated Senior Mixed Epee\r\nUnrated Senior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/22\/2021.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/10\/2021.<\/b>","venue":{"name":"Winter Garden Fencing Academy","address":"44 S.

Go down through the waiting (art) room and up at end of the archery range by the ping pong table. \r\n\r\nLarge fencing bags and stuff must be stored on the lower level (archery range) but strip bags are permitted while you fence. Bring your strip bags or carry your equipment as you move about the floor.   \r\n\r\nDid you know? \"A\"ppreciation rated fencers will receive $15 refund upon completion of the event. All other competitors (not A's) will be awarded a $10 discount if you finish in the top 8 position. \u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nDid you also know that if you earn your \"A\" here you fence for free from now on. Former scholarship winners have included Ian Sanders, Gordon Reis, and Nowell Gibson...who will join their ranks next?\u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nMask up- face masks required at all times. We will have masks breaks and there is also ample outdoor space for you as well.\r\n\r\nWe will flight pools once in order to accommodate  Expect us to flight pools with each pool having 6 to 7 fencers in it.  \u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere is what you need to know about flighting pools and staggering registration times. READ THIS:\r\n\r\n1) You must pay in full, in advance, or you will be scratched 48 hours prior to the start of the event (refunds given with 48 hour advance notice). Further you must make sure your email is correct in askfred so I can communicate with you through their system.\u00c2\u00a0Pay here now, please. \r\n https:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/cart\/\r\n\r\n2) We will balance the \"heats\" and pools taking into consideration ratings, matching clubs and siblings or car pools traveling together. We are not obligated, nor promise to give you a favorable later start time.\u00c2\u00a0 Please don't ask me.... I know many of you are coming from afar and want a later start time. The priority must and will always be fair and equitable pools.\u00c2\u00a0Speaking of which we have created a talented and impartial committee responsible for creating and balancing pools. It's not just me slapping this thing together and hoping for the best.  \r\n\r\n3) If you are siblings or car pooling you MUST notify me of such so I do not split you up into separate heats. This is a courtesy that I am willing to do but again no promises of a later start time only that you will be able to arrive at the same time. Use email to notify me. \u00c2\u00a0Mikem@wayofthesword.org or info@wayofthesword.org. If you fail to notify me you may have two fencers starting at different times. \r\n\r\n4) It is imperative that you show up to the event and fence because the pools will be generated in advance (a risky move for us to manage because not showing up impacts the pool balance). As such you must be aware and with total\u00c2\u00a0 transparency that I reserve the right to manipulate the pools while maintaining balance as needed. In addition you can expect that\u00c2\u00a0I might add a fencer to a pool to \"pad\" and \"hold\" spots in the event that a fencer scratches last minute. This is ONLY a fail safe for me to ensure balanced pools of a minimum of 6 fencers in each pool. \u00c2\u00a0So don't freak out if you see a name of someone that you know who is really not coming. If you see their name, I have received permission to use their name and rating for me to maintain\u00c2\u00a0pool integrity. \r\n\r\n5) \"How will you pull this off? Show me the math?\"\r\nAs many of you already know we have a large facility 11,000 sq feet on two levels. \u00c2\u00a0We will run 6 strips 8 ref's on staff.\r\n\r\nSadly, no parents or coaches will be permitted on the floor during the pools rounds. Let me repeat that....in order to stay within current capacity rules we can run 6 strips (36 fencers) safely plus staff which leaves us no room for parents or coaches during the pools. Pools should take 1.5 hrs but I would plan for 2 hrs to be on the safe side.\u00c2\u00a0We ask parents and fencers in the first heat to leave and enjoy picturesque Ridgefield's shops, restaurants and museums. You can follow the action on Fencing Time Live website as we progress.  \r\n\r\n6) \"What about the DE rounds?\" \u00c2\u00a0Glad you asked.\r\nIn the round of 64, ONLY fencers and coaches will be permitted when your time is called (fencers must leave immediately\u00c2\u00a0after the bout and may return when called for the next round). \r\n\r\nIn the round of 32, fencers and coaches will be permitted when your time is called (fencers must leave immediately\u00c2\u00a0after the bout and may return when called for the next round.\r\n\r\nIn the round of 16 fencers, coaches, parents (you do not have to leave the room)\r\n\r\nIn the round of 8 fencers, coaches, parents and teammates\u00c2\u00a0(you do not have to leave the room)\r\n\r\nIn the round of 4 fencers, coaches, parents and teammates\u00c2\u00a0(you do not have to leave the room)\r\n\r\nIn the round of 2 fencers, coaches, parents and teammates\u00c2\u00a0(you do not have to leave the room) Medals awarded\u00c2\u00a0to the top 8\r\n\r\n7) We will be leveraging Fencing Time Live (https:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\/) to communicate start times, and strips for both pools and DE's.\u00c2\u00a0If you were not aware, in fencing time live you can see your exact start time and strip assignment for each DE round on the tableau page. We will be posting DE bouts in 15 minutes intervals, give or take a\u00c2\u00a0few minutes each way. Our free internet [guest] password is \"getyourway\".\u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nGood to know:\r\n\r\nSafety is number 1 and we will be enforcing face masks at all times.  Further, no screaming and yelling permitted during bouts. \r\n\r\nDuring\u00c2\u00a0the round of 64 and 32, in particular, we are most vulnerable to overcrowding. Please follow the rules and leave the fencing floor after you have finished your bout. Sorry but no hanging around to watch or support your teammates until later rounds.  Let's be respectful and make room for the professional coaches (not teammates) to do their job. Please wait until the round of 8 to cheer on your teammates.  Please, be kind and follow the rules. LET ME BRUTALLY HONEST, IF YOU CHOOSE TO DEFY ME, ARGUE WITH ME, REFUSE TO FOLLOW MY RULES, I WILL THANK YOU KINDLY FOR COMING BUT YOU WILL NOT BE INVITED BACK.\u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nSeating will be designated and separated from each other by 6'. You will assigned a seat on the strips you will be fencing (we may even have name tags awaiting you). Do not move chairs and clump together. Note that on two of our strips (numbers 6 and 9) seating will be along the sides of the strips and as such close to the action. Those seated closest to the center of the strip should wear fencing masks to protect themselves against \"friendly fire.\"  If you do not want this seat we will gladly move you to another location that is off to the end of the strips. \r\n\r\nKnow before you go. Take a look inside at the facility, chairs, strips, etc...this video was taken during warm-ups. \r\nhttps:\/\/www.instagram.com\/p\/CLmLVVQpyPT\/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow us for even more pix and vids:\r\nInstagram.  https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/wayofthesword\r\nhttps:\/\/www.facebook.com\/wayofthesword.org\r\n\r\nGive us a five star Google review today.  https:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/reviews\/\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep safety and kindness first,\r\nCoach Mike\r\nOwner\r\ntext 203 529 1320 \r\nhttps:\/\/wayofthesword.org by day\r\nhttp:\/\/Ridgefieldrave.com by night \r\n\r\n\r\nNow is the time to pay or risk being scratched. Not sure if you paid? Find your receipt or confirmation in venmo or zelle or credit card for your own personal satisfaction.  Please, ONLY send me a copy of your receipt if the last name of the payer is NOT the same as the fencer so I can correlate the payer with the fencer.  \r\n\r\ninfo@wayofthesword.org\r\n\r\nI know many of you are traveling long distances and I am not incentive to such but we have a procedure for deciding on who comes when. \r\n\r\nPriorities are:\r\n1)Rating\r\n2)Club affiliation conflicts\r\n3)Carpooling considerations\r\n4)Travel distance consideration. FYI...I painstakingly look up every club and overlay it on a google map to calculate who is driving the farthest to reach WAY. We give those folks, dare I say, \"right of way\" when possible to create equality in sleep time. In the case of a tie when all else is equal I roll dice to determine who gets the priority. If you take umbrage with this process let me apologize in advance and welcome a discussion on Monday, March 22. \r\n\r\nLastly, you should know that I am NOT the sole decision maker in this process. In fact, there is a committee that reviews and fine tunes the pools prior to publication. The committee is committed to creating a level playing field in our quest to see who is best. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Way of the Sword Fencing","address":"21 Governor Street","city":"Ridgefield","state":"CT","zip":"06877","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.2812523,"longitude":-73.4972894,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":185012,"tournament_id":47150,"tournament":"WAY Epic Epee: Men's A4 cometh & Women's Div 3","full_name":"Div3 Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv3WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":13,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-03-21T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185013,"tournament_id":47150,"tournament":"WAY Epic Epee: Men's A4 cometh & Women's Div 3","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A4","rating_prediction":"A4","entries":72,"prereg_count":77,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-03-21T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47667,"name":"RFC Sabre Tournament Y14  and Y12","start_date":"2021-03-21","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2021-03-02","prereg_close":"2021-03-21","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":5,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"This is an unsanctioned Youth 12 and Youth 14 competition.

While the Louisville Fencing Center is currently open and hopes to stay open, we believe it is our responsibility during this time to prioritize the health and well-being of our fencers and community.  Therefore, The Cory Stauble Memorial Open & Potluck, scheduled for Saturday, March 14th, will be postponed, as COVID-19 has been reported in Kentucky.  We greatly apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.\r\n\r\nWe will communicate regularly through email regarding a reschedule date of the event, after health and state officials provide additional guidance or recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe Cory Stauble Memorial Open is an honored event for the Louisville Fencing Center.

There is currently a Memorial Fencing Fund in Cory's name that helps send young fencers to tournaments as well as helping with other expenses.
