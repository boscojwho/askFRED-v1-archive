wear a fencing jacket, plastron or chest protector, mask and a glove in good condition\r\n  - wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed\r\n  - wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners\r\n  - wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants\r\n  - use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@freestylefencing.com","venue":{"name":"Port Moody Recreational Complex","address":"300 loco Road","city":"Port Moody","state":"BC","zip":"V3H 2V7","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.291643,"longitude":-122.849184,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":59318,"tournament_id":13759,"tournament":"2011 KCF Novice Youth Foil\/Sabre Tournament #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-06-18T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":59319,"tournament_id":13759,"tournament":"2011 KCF Novice Youth Foil\/Sabre Tournament #3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-06-18T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":59320,"tournament_id":13759,"tournament":"2011 KCF Novice Youth Foil\/Sabre Tournament #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-06-18T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":65326,"tournament_id":13759,"tournament":"2011 KCF Novice Youth Foil\/Sabre Tournament #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-06-18T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":65328,"tournament_id":13759,"tournament":"2011 KCF Novice Youth Foil\/Sabre Tournament #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-06-18T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":65329,"tournament_id":13759,"tournament":"2011 KCF Novice Youth Foil\/Sabre Tournament #3","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-06-18T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15042,"name":"Freehold fencing Youth Foil Event","start_date":"2011-06-18","end_date":"","comments":"Y8 Mixed Foil Starts at 9:30a.m \r\nY10 Mixed Foil Starts at 11:00a.m\r\nY12 Mixed Foil starts at 2:00p.m\r\nY12-14 Mixed starts at 4:00p.m","prereg_open":"2011-05-01","prereg_close":"2011-06-17","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Y8 Mixed Foil Starts at 9:30a.m.\r\nY10 Boys Foil Starts at 11:00 a.m\r\nY10 Girls Foil Starts at 11:00 a.m\r\nY12 Boys Foil starts at 2:00 p.m\r\nY12 Girls Foil Starts at 2:00p.m\r\nY12-14 Mixed starts at 4:00p.m\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY8 Mixed Foil\r\nY10 Women's Foil\r\nY10 Men's Foil\r\nY12 Women's Foil\r\nY12 Men's Foil\r\nY12-14  Mixed event.\r\n\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Must wear required fencing attire and bring at least 2 working weapons and 2 working body cords.

This is not a Northeast Division tournament, but a Maine State Games tournament, and any questions and issues related to this tournament should be directed to them, and all proceeds will go to them.  Insurance for this event will be through either Maine State Games, or through the Downeast School of Fencing, not the Northeast Division.  John Krauss will be the official in charge. \r\n\r\nEligibility (as per USFA Rules):\r\nOpen Events - Must be born 1997 or earlier.
