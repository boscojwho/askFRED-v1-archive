The Summer National Championships are held this year in San Jose, CA beginning June 27-July 6. \r\n\r\nDoors open at 8:00 AM and registration and equipment check opens at 8:30 AM.   Times listed are \"close of registration.\" That being said, we encourage everyone (especially beginners to the sport) to be at the venue AT LEAST one half hour before the CLOSE of your event, to make sure you can sign in and get your equipment checked and approved BEFORE the close of registration for your event. \r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2014-2015) competitive members of the USFA and must be members of the Oregon Division; fencers from other divisions are not eligible to compete. Y14 fencers must fall in that age bracket OR the athlete must be on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket.\r\n\r\nPermanent residents who have not represented another country in the last three years may participate. If we need you to fence in order to qualify more fencers (i.e. bring the event size to 13 or 17 fencers), and you are already auto-qualified for the SN, fees waived for you. Otherwise, we discourage auto-qualified fencers from fencing in the qualifier.\r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD! All fencers must be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership.  Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nIn each event, the top 25% (minimum of 3, rounded up) who were not previously qualified (i.e. through a ROC) will qualify for SNQ. If 3 or fewer fencers show up for an event, the event will not be fenced, and all will qualify. Fencers that earn qualification at the DIV II events will automatically qualify for the corresponding DIV III events event (if rating-eligible.)\r\n\r\nPre-registration and pre-payment (the latter is a new requirement) on FRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Friday, April 3. If you sign up and pay on-line by that time, your discounted registration fees are $15 per fencer, plus $15 per event (i.e., a total of $30 for one event).  You can sign-up and pay on-line after that time, but your fees will increase to triple registration fee and double event fee (through April 9, 11:59pm). Starting April 10, you may fence with a fee of double registration fee and triple event fee (this is the only circumstance in which you will be allowed to pay at the door \u0096 please bring cash or a check, made out to the Oregon Division, credit cards not accepted). \r\n\r\nIn the case that you pre-pay, and then must withdraw, the following is the Division refund policy:\r\n\u0095 By the close of on-time pre-registration \u0096 Full refund minus $5 because the Division is liable for the AskFred % fee.\r\n\u0095 Up to 11:59pm the Thursday before the event \u0096 Event fee refund only (must be a request via email to the board.)\r\n\u0095 Day of Event \u0096 Event fee refund only upon a verifiable medical withdrawal before event start.\r\n\u0095 No refunds after the fact.\r\n\r\nFull USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. Foil events require conductive foil masks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. Weapons are checked on the strip. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate that we will offer an opportunity to get your equipment tested the night before the event, depending on Saturday morning numbers, and will confirm that fact through AskFred. Please make sure that AskFred has your current email address. \r\n\r\nHere are additional important notes:\r\nHealthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area. \r\n\r\nOur qualifier is entirely staffed (with the exception of the referees) by volunteers, without whom this event would not take place, so please contact the tournament organizers at Board@usfa-or.org if you can help a shift. \r\n\r\nAs a last note, in 2013, the USFA Board of Directors adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines new requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. \r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\nTournament: Oregon Division Summer National Qualifiers\r\nDate(s): 04\/11\/2015 - 04\/12\/2015\r\nLocation: NorthWest Fencing Center\r\nFor directions, visit http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=29046\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/28\/2014\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

We invite any fencers who would like to participate, to sign-up here at AskFRED to try it out.\r\n\r\nDESF Practice Round Robins: These practice events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability.

All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10021","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661539,"longitude":-73.9793673,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":115500,"tournament_id":29257,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-12T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":115501,"tournament_id":29257,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-12T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":115502,"tournament_id":29257,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-12T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":115503,"tournament_id":29257,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-12T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":29514,"name":"Fencers Club Youth Foil (8-10-12)","start_date":"2015-04-12","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for a Youth Foil Tournament with Y8-10-12 events.

Join or renew at http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership.  If you need to join USA Fencing on-site, you will need a separate check or credit card # for their form. \r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y14 points will be allowed to fence Cadets.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Metropolitan Division sanctioned event. Ratings will be awarded where earned.\r\n\r\nPlease bring a check or cash if you don't prepay using AskFred; no credit cards accepted at the door for entry fees.\r\n\r\nNo refunds! If you need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail (info@brooklynfencing.com) by Friday, 4\/10, to receive a credit for a future event.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetition Format\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination; for 12 or fewer fencers, third place qualifying spot will be fenced off.\r\n\r\nNEW LOCATION 600 Degraw Street (between 3rd & 4th Ave) - Closest train is the R at Union Street, three blocks away.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster).  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. \r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3851  Warren  Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9608254,"longitude":-75.1995622,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":115357,"tournament_id":29184,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-18T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29449,"name":"Athens Fencing Spring Duel","start_date":"2015-04-18","end_date":"","comments":"This is our Spring unsanctioned 3 weapon event.\r\nFirst event is $20.

If there are at lease 5 girls and 5 boys, we will separate the event by gender.\r\n\r\n This is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful. \r\n\r\n Fencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver to participate. All events will be fenced electronically. There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament. \r\n\r\n These tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\n Beginning referees are welcome! We will provide lunch for anyone refereeing multiple events. Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\n For additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\n Brenda Waddoups\r\n Fencing Institute of Texas, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=28698\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/17\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
