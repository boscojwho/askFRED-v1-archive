If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

You must be an active member of Metro Tacoma Fencing Club (MTFC) or an active member of one of our affiliated clubs -- Washington Fencing Academy or Kitsap Fencing Center -- to participate. \r\n\r\nA current 2016-2017 membership to the US Fencing Association is also required for this event due to insurance and liability requirements. This session is geared towards the competitive fencer.\r\n\r\n---------- Strategy and Tactics Clinic Goals ----------- \r\n\r\nDo you find that you have an awesome lunge? And your parry 4 is amazing? But yet you can't seem to do as well and bring home as many medals as you deserve? Even worse, do you lose to old, slow, guys with hemorrhoids who are rated higher than you despite being not all that smart (like Toby and Aaron)? The thing is, they are tricky. And they want to share some of their tricks with you.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this clinic is to share some tactics and strategies that you can use when facing your opponent. Are you struggling against worse fencers? Do you fall for your opponents' attacks or defense? Are they left handed and hug the left side of the strip driving you nuts? Do you lunge just because you can't think of anything else to do? Did you just lose a bout in 10 seconds? Did you not watch your opponents the entire pool and get surprised when they do things to you that they have been doing all tournament long? Do your parent's need some help with their strip coaching? Maybe some video review would improve your game. \r\n\r\nAnd we bet you want one of those cool Coach Toby pool sheets that tell you when you are up next but more importantly take secret notes on your opponents. You will get all this to help increase your fencing awesomeness!\r\n\r\n------------------ Time and Location ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: MTFC Strategy and Tactics Clinic with Tournament\r\nDate: May 21, 2017\r\nClose of Registration: 1 PM\r\nTournament Size Restriction: 15 foil and 10 epee fencers\r\nLocation: Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Tacoma, WA\r\n\r\nWe are physically located at 1106 South 15th Street, Tacoma, WA 98405 in the Sons of Norway building called \"Normanna Hall\" at the corner of 15th and Martin Luther King. Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 1 PM. The clinic will start promptly at 1 PM and last for approximately 60 minutes. Fencing will begin at 2 PM. Coaching will occur throughout the tournament. Parent\/family are encouraged to participate in the clinic session with your registered fencer. Family is also encouraged to record video which can be reviewed. Fencers can practice strip coaching each other.\r\n\r\n-------------------- Entry Fee -------------------- \r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $40 for the Strategy and Tactics Clinic followed by Tournament.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to bring in a video recording device and if possible a VGA adapter so we can review on a monitor time permitting.\r\n\r\n---------------------- Coaches ----------------------- \r\n\r\nTobias Lee, Prevot in Foil, Epee B2016, Foil C2015\r\nAaron Page, Assistant Moniteur, Epee B2017, Foil C2014\r\nAndrew Lee, Assistant Moniteur, Epee A2016, Foil C2016\r\nBenjamin Lee, Assistant Moniteur, Foil A2016, Epee D2015\r\nZoe Tolbert, Moniteur in Foil, Foil B2017\r\n\r\nFor more information about the coaches see https:\/\/metrotacoma.wordpress.com\/home\/staff\/\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Format ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. \r\n\r\nThis will be a round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. The pools will not be determined the standard fashion but instead be filled with the top rated fencers in pool 1, the next strongest fencers in pool 2, and for foil the remaining fencers in pool 3. This will provide better practice with more evenly matched fencers during the important pool round for participants. It will make the direct elimination rounds uneven and unpredictable, but this quirk may be more representative of what often happens at national events. The tournament is more to help practice what is learned during the clinic.\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by official USFA classification and PointControl.info score approximately 1-2 weeks before the event to separate fencers of similar ratings.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that pools will take approximately 60 minutes. Direct eliminations will take approximately 60 minutes. We will reserve another 30 minutes after the event for final questions and video review.\r\n\r\n------------------ Coach Toby Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis tournament is restricted due to club space availability to the first 25 fencers who preregister on AskFRED. If you register and take a spot but do not show up for the event, Coach Toby will be very disappointed, and you may find that all your future in-house registrations may unexpectedly get cancelled...like for all of eternity. When you register for the event on AskFRED you will receive an e-mail with a link to unregister yourself in case you find that you cannot attend. Please be respectful of other club members.

However instead of fencing 3 different weapon styles for each age group the fencers of each age group will decide which weapon style to fence by popular vote. If we have time and fencers are willing we can fence a 2nd weapon style per age group.","venue":{"name":"Red Stick School of Fencing","address":"15450 George O'Neal Rd Ste 11","city":"Baton Rouge","state":"LA","zip":"70817","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":30.4082088,"longitude":-91.0146999,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":65,"name":"Louisiana","abbrev":"LA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":143791,"tournament_id":36272,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Beginner Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2017-05-27T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143792,"tournament_id":36272,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Beginner Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2017-05-27T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143793,"tournament_id":36272,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Beginner Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2017-05-27T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143794,"tournament_id":36272,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Beginner Epee","short_name":"U-Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2017-05-27T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143795,"tournament_id":36272,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Beginner Epee","short_name":"U-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2017-05-27T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143796,"tournament_id":36272,"tournament":"RSSF Beginners tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Beginner Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginner","close_of_reg":"2017-05-27T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":35761,"name":"USF It's Just a Fleche Wound #5","start_date":"2017-05-27","end_date":"","comments":"It's time for a Memorial Day \/ May Madness \/ Monty Python themed tournament at USF!

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament.
