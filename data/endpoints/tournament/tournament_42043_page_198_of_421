Separate awards for boys' and girls' placements may be given.\r\nCadet and Junior events will require foil masks with bibs and head-wires.\r\nWe will be testing weapons in Cadet and Junior events.\r\nCadet and Junior events will be CFF sanctioned, so CFF memberships will be required.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron or chest protector, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@freestylefencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All Saints Elementary School Gymnasium","address":"1405 Como Lave

Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it's about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.  After you cross the railroad tracks look for the college on the left.  Depending on where in Houston you're coming from it's about an hour drive.  We'll have some signs up to direct you to the gym.\r\n\r\nIf you have a GPS, plug in \"500 College Dr., Lake Jackson, TX, 77566\".\r\n\r\nMap:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/tinyurl.com\/bcfal\r\n\r\nIf you get lost call me on my cell - 979 848 7433\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brazosport College, Lake Jackson TX","address":"","city":"Lake Jackson","state":"TX","zip":"77566","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":29.0620369,"longitude":-95.4882679,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":98857,"tournament_id":24652,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Div2 Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":5,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-30T12:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":98858,"tournament_id":24652,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Div2 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":19,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-30T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":99979,"tournament_id":24652,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed Youth Unrated non-USFA Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Youth Unrated non-USFA","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24912,"name":"HoF Free Open Practice","start_date":"2013-11-30","end_date":"","comments":"We are welcoming our college kids back with a free open practice.

Fencing will commence when there is available space on piste. As with any tournament, there may be waiting involved. We will also ask for coaches and athletes to help with presiding over bouts. There will be no food service so bring a bag lunch and lots to drink. The boys and girls individual tournaments may be mixed in order for the kids to get lots more fencing in and because of numbers. Chest protectors and athletic cups are suggested for athletes. Full equipment is needed to fence: Mask, jacket, pants, knee length socks, sous- plastron, glove.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
