A novice fencer has less than 2 years competition experience and has not placed in the top 3 of another event. Event is fenced dry. Fencers will act as side-judges when not fencing. Limit - 18 fencers.\r\n\r\nEntry fee $25 if preregistered by 2\/9\/2008. Late entry fee $35 for registrations on 2\/10\/2008 or later. (Includes $5 online fee.) All fees paid at door are cash only. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nUnrated Cadet\/ Junior\/ Senior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nCurrent USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street. Showers available.\r\n\r\nFAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in convertion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. I see two events listed, are they fenced as separate tournaments?\r\nA. No.  This is one combined event and is only separated out to allow everybody to register for the event.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nPre-registered fencers - if you are unable to attend, PLEASE delete your registration so that others can sign up. Email the organizer if you can't figure out how to do that.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster

Turn left at this light and immediately turn right onto Hwy. 41 North (turn right before going under the bridge) After about 2 miles (after the traffic light,) turn right to exit onto Hwy. 411 South\/Hwy. 20 West.\r\n\r\nAfter about 18 miles and 4 traffic lights, get in the right lane and take the middle exit ramp (the sign above the ramp says \"Rome\") This road turns into Turner McCall Blvd as it goes into town.\r\n\r\nStay on Turner McCall Blvd. for about 3.5 miles. At this point (at the intersection of Horseleg Creek Rd,) the road changes names to Shorter Ave.\r\n\r\nLess than 1\/4 mile from the intersection at Horseleg Creek Rd, turn left at the traffic light onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign here also says \"Shorter College.\" After turning, take an immediate left, and go through the security gate.\r\n\r\nThe road will fork shortly after the security gate. Stay to the left. You will go around an \"S\" curve. You will see a large parking lot after going around the curve. The Winthrop-King Center will be on your left, downhill from the parking lot.  \r\n________________________________________\r\nComing From Huntsville \r\nTake Highway 72 to the Tennessee River (Scotsboro.) Go over the river (I think the bridge over the river is Highway 35.) After going over the river, take Highway 40 to I-59. Go over I-59 and take Highway 117 through Hammondville and Mentone and into Georgia. After you reach Cloudland, GA, take Highway 48 to Summerville. From Summerville, take Highway 27 South, which goes into Rome.\r\n \r\nAfter you pass the traffic light at Mount Berry Square Mall and the one at Berry College, Highway 20 will turn into Martha Berry Blvd. Stay on Martha Berry Blvd. until you get to Turner McCall Blvd (Wallgreens will be on your right.) Turn right, and go through two traffic lights. Less that 1\/4 mile after the 3rd light (Horseleg Creek Rd,) turn left onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign here also says \"Shorter College.\" After turning, take an immediate left, and go through the security gate.\r\n\r\nThe road will fork shortly after the security gate. Stay to the left. You will go around an \"S\" curve. You will see a large parking lot after going around the curve. The Winthrop-King Center will be on your left, downhill from the parking lot.  \r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\nComing From Birmingham \r\nTake I-59 to Gadsden (via I-759) After I-759 ends, take Highway 411 North\/East to Centre. From Centre, take Highway 20 East into Rome. Highway 20 turns into Shorter Ave. Take Shorter Ave. through town. After you pass Sams Club and Wal Mart (on your left,) keep going for a little over two miles. Take a right at a traffic light onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign at here also says \"Shorter College.\" (Buffalo's Restaurant will be on the left shortly before you turn.) After turning, take an immediate left, and go through the security gate.\r\n\r\nThe road will fork shortly after the security gate. Stay to the left. You will go around an \"S\" curve.

As we have done in prior years, we will NOT fence events that have 4 or fewer clubs represented since all 4 will automatically qualify.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine if which (if any) events need to be fenced, clubs are required to pre-register their club on AskFRED by midnight on Wednesday, February 20th.  On the 21st, an email will be sent out announcing which events will be fenced and at what time.  \r\n\r\nClubs that qualify for the Senior event will also qualify for the corresponding Division I event.  The USFA does not require us to run separate Division I and Senior team events.  The fencers that you list as the team members at the qualifier do not have to be the fencers that actually attend the events at Summer Nationals.  However, the fencers that attend the Division I team event in April will be required to have a C rating or higher. \r\n\r\nAll fencers on the U19 teams must be born between 1989 and 1995.\r\n\r\nTo pre-register a team:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=5367\r\n\r\nIf you're curious about all the arcane rules about how team qualifiers are determined, see pages 6-7

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24720,"tournament_id":5406,"tournament":"Philadelphia D and Under Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-01T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5423,"name":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2008","start_date":"2008-03-01","end_date":"","comments":"Presented by the UBC Fencing Club.\r\n\r\nPre-registration opens 02\/04\/2008 and closes 02\/29\/2008.","prereg_open":"2008-02-04","prereg_close":"2008-02-29","authority":"CFF","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"2008 STEPHEN LAZAR MEMORIAL TOURNAMENT\r\n\r\nPresented by the UBC Fencing Club\r\n\r\nThe UBC Fencing Club would like to invite all fencers to the annual Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament.

IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $4.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS: ----------\r\n\r\nAccommodations at the University of British Columbia are available for those who wish to stay on campus for the tournament.
