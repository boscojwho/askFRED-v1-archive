If there are at least 5 girls and 5 boys, we will separate the event by gender. Medals will be given to the top 4 boys and top 4 girls in each event.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful.  Future dates are March 23, April 27 and May 11.\r\n\r\nFencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver (attached) to participate. All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome! Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\nFor additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\nBrenda Waddoups\r\nFencing Institute of Texas, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=42820\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/22\/2019\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We expect to have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2010-2013\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2008-2011\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2004-2007\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=41423\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/22\/2019\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

This tournament is held in honor of Ned Light, a founding coach of our club whom we lost to cancer in 2011. Ned was a varsity fencer at Duke University, founder of Triangle Fencing Club, and a huge supporter of youth fencing in North Carolina. When Mid-South opened its first location in Durham in 2008, Ned brought his club to Mid-South to help kick-start the development of a competitive youth saber program in Durham. Many of Ned's students have earned national recognition and went on to compete with varsity collegiate teams across the country. \r\n\r\nJeff Kallio & Jennifer Oldham\r\nMid-South Fencers' Club\r\nDurham, NC\r\ninfo@midsouthfencersclub.org\r\n(919)-286-3100","venue":{"name":"Mid-South Fencers' Club","address":"125 North Gregson Street","city":"Durham","state":"NC","zip":"27701","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":36.0008843,"longitude":-78.9089981,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":59,"name":"North Carolina","abbrev":"NC","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":169902,"tournament_id":42743,"tournament":"The Ned Light Memorial Saber RYC (Region 6)","full_name":"Y10 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y10WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-02-23T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":169903,"tournament_id":42743,"tournament":"The Ned Light Memorial Saber RYC (Region 6)","full_name":"Y10 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y10MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-02-23T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":169904,"tournament_id":42743,"tournament":"The Ned Light Memorial Saber RYC (Region 6)","full_name":"Y12 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y12WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-02-24T10:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":169905,"tournament_id":42743,"tournament":"The Ned Light Memorial Saber RYC (Region 6)","full_name":"Y12 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y12MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-02-24T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":169906,"tournament_id":42743,"tournament":"The Ned Light Memorial Saber RYC (Region 6)","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-02-24T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":169907,"tournament_id":42743,"tournament":"The Ned Light Memorial Saber RYC (Region 6)","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-02-24T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41731,"name":"Orange Coast Division 3 Weapon Open","start_date":"2019-02-24","end_date":"","comments":"This is a division sanctioned event.

afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a stoppage at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events will be sanctioned and require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nY8, Y10 and Y12 events require a minimum of 4 fencers.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events require a minimum of 6 fencers for sanctioning.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of fencers of each gender.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, chest protector (must for girls), mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't yet have proper knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers in Y12 and above events will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:\r\nhttp:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow like: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All

Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.**\r\n\r\nNJFA is a member of the NJ Division of the USFA http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n \r\nCheck USA rating at:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nFencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf?_ga=2.44686689.433513283.1547236097-1943416123.1546365588 \r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2006-2009) and Senior (2005 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n5:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it's ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior: can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries x place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates and prize themes for the 2018-2019 events:\r\n#1 August 25, 2018, National Dog Day\r\n#2 October 27, 2018, National Chocolate Day\r\n#3 January 5, 2019, National Science Fiction Day\r\n#4 March 2, 2019, National Frozen Foods Day\r\n#5 May 18, 2019, National Learn to Swim Day\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"7601 Boulevard 26, Ste. 131","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8315632,"longitude":-97.22008,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":162964,"tournament_id":41041,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y10Y12 Mixed Intermediate Saber","short_name":"U-Y1012MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"Intermediate","close_of_reg":"2019-03-02T15:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162965,"tournament_id":41041,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y10Y12 Mixed Novice Saber","short_name":"U-Y1012MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"Novice","close_of_reg":"2019-03-02T12:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162966,"tournament_id":41041,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Intermediate Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"Intermediate","close_of_reg":"2019-03-02T17:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162967,"tournament_id":41041,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Novice Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"Novice","close_of_reg":"2019-03-02T14:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41298,"name":"The Foil Melee","start_date":"2019-03-02","end_date":"","comments":"It's a Super Pool!

You may not enter events which start at the same time.\r\n\r\nNote: unrated mens and womens events may be combined if there are fewer than 6 of one gender.\r\n\r\nYouth events are open to kids in both the Y10 and Y12 age groups (combined) and do not require competitive USFA membership.\r\nAll other events (open, veterans, unrated) do require USFA competitive membership or the Canadian equivalent.\r\nElectric foil masks are not required for youth events; they are required for all other foil events.\r\n\r\nAlso: food, raffle, t-shirts...don't miss the party!\r\n\r\nEntry fees: If registered by February 25, $15 for your first event of the weekend plus $5 per additional event.  If registered after that,  $20 for your first event of the weekend plus $10 per additional event.\r\n\r\nFor those traveling from afar:  Hospitality can sometimes be arranged in the homes of local fencers (living within 15 miles) on a first come first served basis.  Contact me if interested, at least 2 weeks in advance.  If you would prefer to stay in a hotel, here are some possibilities:\r\n\r\nThe closest hotel is the Marriott Courtyard (www.middleburycourtyard.com).\r\nThe Middlebury Inn (historic inn in center of village) sometimes has lower prices than the Courtyard, and more character: www.middleburyinn.com\r\n\r\nLess upscale and also nearby are\r\nMiddlebury Sweets Motel www.middmotel.com (yes, it has its own candy store...)\r\nSugar House Motel www.sugarhousemotel.com\r\n\r\nIf you want to treat yourself to more luxury, try:\r\nSwift House Inn (www.swifthouseinn.com)\r\nInn on the Green (www.innonthegreen.com)\r\nWaybury Inn (www.wayburyinn.com), in East Middlebury, famous as the set for the Bob Newhart show (for those of you old enough to remember...)\r\n\r\nOr, my personal favorite way to travel...there are several AirBnB guesthouses within 15 miles of the venue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/05\/2018.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/01\/2019.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Middlebury Union Middle School","address":"48 Deerfield
