He was a member of the 1948 Olympic saber squad, and in 1952, 1956, and 1960 the Olympic foil squads.   He coached at Salle Santelli, in Westchester high schools, and at CCNY. Among his former students were Tom Ciccarone, Craig Cummings, and Uriah Jones. In 2001 he was inducted into the US Fencing Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Floyd Little Athletic Center, New Haven CT","address":"480 Sherman Pkwy","city":"New Haven","state":"CT","zip":"06511","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.3229465,"longitude":-72.9391963,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":173557,"tournament_id":43833,"tournament":"Neil Lazar RYC\/RJCC ","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":45380,"name":"NYFA \"E\" and Under Mixed Epee","start_date":"2019-11-16","end_date":"","comments":"USFA Sanctioned E and Under Mixed Epee.

We will NOT accept any late pre-registrations after that time!\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis is the official 2020 Junior Olympic Qualifiers ONLY for members of the Tennessee Division. \r\n\r\nENTRY & ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nAll close of registration times are in Central Standard Time (CST). These are not the times that the events will actually start. Please arrive early to have your equipment checked (mask, lame, glove, 2 body cords, 2 mask cords), and allow time for warm-up and check-in. Venue will be opened at least 1 hour prior to close of registration of first event. \r\n\r\nRegistration fee is $25 + an event fee of $25 for each event entry (i.e If you pre-register for one event, you will pay a total of $50, if you pre-register for two events, you will only pay a total of $75., etc.) \r\n\r\nIf there are 3 or fewer fencers pre-registered for an event after the close of pre-registration on 11\/13\/19, the event will NOT be fenced, and the fencer does not need to attend the event; those pre-registered for that event will automatically be qualified to the Jr. Olympics in that event only. The Registration fee ($25) will NOT be refunded, however the event fees ($25) may be refunded ONLY if requested in writing and received by 11\/23\/19. \r\n\r\nFencers MUST be Citizen or Permanent Resident (proof required). All fencers must have a CURRENT USA Fencing \"Competitive\" Membership and show proof (Membership ID Card) at check-in. ONLY members of the TN Division of USA Fencing may compete in this qualifier. You may join or renew your membership here: https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced (Read more here: https:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/2ef6-1644656\/2018_2019_Age_and_Classification_Chart.pdf; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail chairmain@tennesseefencing.org to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y14 National Points will be allowed to fence Cadet.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Tennessee Division Sanctioned event; ratings will be awarded where earned. Cadet events must be rated as a C1 or higher for any classifications to be awarded.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION FORMAT:\r\n\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination.\r\n\r\nQUALIFYING:\r\n\r\nThe top 25% (round up) of the field in an event will qualify for the Jr. Olympics in that event.  \r\n\r\nIf a fencer qualifies in the Jr. Event for one weapon, they will also qualify for the Cadet Event in that same weapon (ONLY if they are age eligible to compete in the Cadet category).\r\n\r\nWhen determining who has qualified for a Championship, only fencers who qualify through\r\nNational Points are skipped over to the next eligible fencer. Fencers that qualify for championships\r\nvia regional points are NOT skipped over. Those who qualify through the division should NOT be skipped.\r\nFor example, if a fencer competes and qualifies in a Junior division qualifier and is age eligible for Cadet,\r\nhe\/she will NOT get skipped over if they choose to also fence in the Cadet division qualifier. Those who\r\nqualify for Div IA, Div II, or Div III by earning regional ROC points are NOT considered automatic qualifiers at divisional qualifiers and should NOT be skipped over when determining qualifying places. \r\n\r\nUNIFORMS & EQUIPMENT:\r\n\r\nFencers are required to have complete fencing uniforms as required by USA Fencing. This includes the following items: Mask with two retaining devices aka straps (foil masks must have a conductive bib, Epee masks cannot have a conductive bib), mask cord (foil\/saber), jacket, plastron (underarm protector), knickers, lame (foil\/saber), glove (800N FIE required for saber), tall socks (must overlap knickers, proper footwear (no sandals, boots, heeled shoes, etc.), two working body cords and two working electric weapons.  Foil fencers wearing a chest protector are now REQUIRED to have it covered by a soft material.  Please read details to clarify (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/news_article\/show\/922236).\r\n\r\nWeights (foil\/epee) and shims (epee) will be tested!\r\nMasks, lames, gloves, saber cuffs, body cords, mask cords will we tested\/checked! \r\n\r\nFor more info about the Junior Olympics, see the USA Fencing website. \r\n\r\nAny questions should be directed to the TN Division Chairman, Robert Piraino for clarification.

Events with simultaneous close of registration may not necessarily be fenced at the same time.\r\n\r\nDoors open at 9:00 AM every day for registration and equipment check.\r\n\r\nPer USFA guidelines, age groups with fewer than 4 of each gender will be fenced mixed (boys and girls together). In larger events, boys and girls will fence separately. Separate awards for boys' and girls' placements will be given in any case.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility:\r\n\r\nY10 - Fencers born in 2009-2012\r\nY12 - Fencers born in 2007-2010\r\nY14 - Fencers born in 2005-2008\r\n\r\nEquipment Requirements:\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark all lames, masks, body cords, and gloves. Weight testing and other weapon inspection will be done at the strip. Y10 fencers must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nPer USA Fencing policy, all saber fencers must use 800N gloves. Foil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. Chest protectors are still required for girls and optional for boys in all weapons.\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including fencing pants, long socks, and underarm protector, must be worn. Names on uniforms are not required. Fencers should bring a minimum of two working weapons and body cords to the strip. Rain City Fencing Center has equipment available for purchase.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil (or sabre) masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2019-2020) competitive members of USA Fencing. Foreign fencers must obtain a Foreign Competitive membership from USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nFees and Registration:\r\n\r\nEntry fees will vary depending on when you make your payment.\r\n\r\nOn or before November 1, 2019:\r\n\r\n    $20 registration fee\r\n    $30 per event\r\n\r\nAfter November 1, 2019 triple fees will apply:\r\n\r\n    $60 registration fee\r\n    $90 per event\r\n\r\nNote that USA Fencing adds a $5 Admin Fee to your registration. This fee is mandated by USA Fencing and is not part of the entry fees we receive.\r\n\r\nAll registrations and payments must be made through the USA Fencing site.\r\n\r\nRegistration and admin fees are non-refundable. To request a refund of event fees, send us an email. Refund requests must be received by Sunday, November 17th.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2007-2012) and Senior (2006 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nIT'S NATIONAL GINGERBREAD COOKIE DAY! All prizes will be delicious and crispy!\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:00 PM - Senior Novice\r\n2:00 PM - Youth Novice\/Intermediate *\r\n4:00 PM - Senior Intermediate\r\n\r\n* Depending upon the exact participant mix, the youth event may be fenced entirely together, with separate awards given for Novice and Intermediate divisions or separated. Or it may be separated by age categories. Decision will be made by CEFC staff at the close of registratoin.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it's ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior: can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries x place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact Jade Calvert at j.calvert@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"7601 Boulevard 26","city":"N.
