That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event.

Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (patrick@nyacsabre.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (patrick@nyacsabre.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"195 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661857,"longitude":-73.9794418,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":123378,"tournament_id":31308,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup Sabre #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":11,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-09-26T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":31312,"name":"Bald Eagle Premiere (D & Under)","start_date":"2015-09-26","end_date":"","comments":"$10 Preregistration, $15 Walk-in Registration.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 9\/23\/15. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 9\/23\/15) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

There will be no exceptions to this policy. Any refunds will be net of surcharges from Ask Fred.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS:\r\n\r\nUSFA uniform requirements apply. Names are NOT required on your uniform. Fencers must wear the required clothing regulation fencing jacket and pants, underarm protector (plastron), knee socks and a fencing glove that covers half the forearm. The electric foil bib is required. Women must wear breast protectors. In epee and foil, a full jacket is required (i.e., a jacket with croissard \/ groin strap). \r\n\r\nWarm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing uniforms or gloves must not have any rips, tears, holes, etc. USA Fencing allows uniforms of a single pastel color or designs on the rear (unarmed) arm and leg. As the purpose of uniform color or design is for audience interest, such designs should be in good taste. For safety and insurance purposes, fencers must wear full fencing attire while participating in drills, lessons or warm-up.\r\n\r\nBlade Length: Y8 & Y10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches (\u00930 & 2's\u0094). Parents and fencers are advised that blades marked as \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however some blades labeled as #2 have exceeded 32.5 inches, these blades will not be permitted.\r\n \r\nEQUIPMENT CHECK \r\n\r\nParents and fencers should plan accordingly and arrive at least 1 hour prior to the close of check in, there may be significant lines for equipment check.   Please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nFencers must present to the armorer for testing of mask, lame jacket, gloves (saber) and body cords. Items passing inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\nAll events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary inspection will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE to ensure the presence of the following equipment: underarm plastron, weapons, body cords and all appropriate weapons check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met. \r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other required equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules. \r\n\r\nFencers will only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the tournament. \r\n\r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords. Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition. \r\n\r\nNote that Blue Gauntlet Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\n\r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.\r\n \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2015-16 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2016, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1999-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1997-2003 and for the cadet events 2000-2003.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661646,"longitude":-73.9793924,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":121984,"tournament_id":30964,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #1 Men's Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":30,"prereg_count":28,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-09-27T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":31491,"name":"MASTERS FC Referee Practical Test 2015","start_date":"2015-09-29","end_date":"","comments":"FENCERS MUST BE REGISTER IN THE USFA.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

Fencers must check-in each day that they compete, within the indicated hours of check-in, or they will be withdrawn from that event.\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO COMPETE, FENCERS MUST CHECK-IN AT THE VENUE WITH THE FOLLOWING IN HAND:\r\n\r\n1. A USA Fencing membership card (valid for the current competitive season); AND\r\n2. A waiver form that has been signed by a parent or legal guardian; AND\r\n3. A birth-certificate (copy acceptable) or other government-issued identification showing the fencer's birth date.\r\n\r\nTo help us at registration, please download the waiver form, print it, read it, sign it, and bring it to the table with you. This is especially critical if the fencer does not have a parent\/guardian at check-in. No one will be allowed to fence without a signed waiver form.\r\n\r\nNew USA Fencing memberships and new or replacement USA Fencing cards should be obtained through the USA Fencing website before the tournament. \r\n\r\nAthletes arriving without proof of USA Fencing membership must fill out all appropriate forms and pay for membership at registration even if already a member. Refund requests can be made later with USA Fencing as appropriate. \r\n\r\nFencers who fail to register by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be made.\r\n\r\nNote that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nUNIFORM REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nPlease note that the new sabre glove requirement will be enforced at this tournament.

Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\" All events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: Underarm plastron, 2nd weapon and body cord, weapon check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nWeapons with grips other than French will not be inspected or marked in advance. Regardless, failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 7 \u0096 8 am on Friday and Saturday. Please plan accordingly. \r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\n\r\nSeeding:  Seeding shall be based on the following (in order):\r\n1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nFencers from the same club will be separated as much as possible in the first round of competition.  \r\n\r\nThe Svetlana Chayevsky Atlanta Fencing Classic will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing.

If you miss the deadline, you will be subject to DOUBLE fees.  Entry fees collected at the door will be subject to TRIPLE fees. \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register & pay online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=30720\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Registration Q & A ---\r\nQ: Must saber fencers use the new 800N glove?\r\nA: Yes, we will be enforcing this new rule.\r\n\r\nQ: I missed the registration deadline, can I still attend?\r\nA: Yes, you can still sign up on AskFRED at double fees.  If you pay at the door, the fees will be triple.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I pre-register and pay later?\r\nA: Sort-of.  Pre-register on AskFRED like you normally would, but skip the payment screen.  This will add you to the list of registrants, but note that you have not yet paid.  You can pay later (before the deadline) by simply going through the registration process on AskFRED again.\r\n\r\nQ: I don't want to pre-pay until I'm certain I can attend.\r\nA: If you pre-pay and are unable to attend, we will give you a refund of your event fees.

In events with fewer than 11 entrants, the BC may elect to have two rounds of pools followed by 100% promoted to a DE (direct elimination) tableau. There is no fence-off for third place. One preliminary round of pools is comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to DE round. DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. \r\n\r\n<i>Y8\/Y10 DE format: <\/i>10-touch bouts (two periods of 3 minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period). The first period ends either at the expiration of 3 minutes or when the score reaches 5 touches on one side, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n<i>Y12 DE format: <\/i>15-touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute rest between each period).

Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. No classification changes will be made at the event. Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during tournament: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT PREPARATION GUIDES<\/b>\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\nThese guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments.\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html (courtesy of fencing.net)\r\nParents Guide to Fencing: http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html (courtesy of Fencing.net)\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n<b>=========================<\/b>\r\n<b>VENUE<\/b>\r\n<b>=========================<\/b>\r\n Lakawanna Warehouse\r\n 629 Grove Street, 4th Floor\r\n Jersey, City NJ\r\n\r\n FREE Wi-Fi\r\n FREE Parking\r\n\r\n PARKING INFORMATION: \r\n To avoid possibility of your car being towed, note these parking instructions:\r\n\r\n Parking is available in lot directly across street and also the parking lot at the southwest corner of 18th\/Grove Streets. Once the main parking lot is filled there are 3 other parking locations:\r\n 1. You can park nose into the cyclone fence on 16th Street between Grove St. and Marin Blvd. DO NOT park in front of the sliding gate however.\r\n 2. There is a parking lot at the corner of Grove Street and 18th St.\r\n 3. You can go up the ramp located on Marin Blvd between 18th and 16th street. DO NOT block access to the truck bays. Stay to the right. If you are parking here we suggest you drop off your fencer with a parent to check in. It's about a 10 minute walk down the ramp and around the block to the Lackawanna Warehouse.\r\n\r\n If you arrive at Cobra and are unable to find parking either in the lot directly across the street, nose in along the fence on 16th Street between Grove and Marin (excluding the sliding gate entrance which is marked with cones), or the parking lot on the corner of 18th Street and Grove St. you should:\r\n 1. Drop off your fencer and a parent at the building entrance with their equipment so they can go up to the fourth floor and check in. \r\n 2. Drive to the corner of Grove St and 18th St. Turn left and proceed about 200 yards until you see a yellow post at an open entrance on the left. You can turn in and park as long as you stay well right. Do not block any truck bays or construction areas. Do not go left into The Cake Boss\u0092s parking area. Walk back to Grove Street along 18th St.\r\n\r\n NEAREST AIRPORT: Newark Liberty International (12 miles away)\r\n\r\n PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: From Manhattan by train: PATH train from Manhattan to Hoboken.

The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n\r\n2.The conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\n3.In order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\n4.The conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/25\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/02\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Heartland Fencing Academy","address":"10727 El Monte","city":"Overland Park","state":"KS","zip":"66211","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":38.9230586,"longitude":-94.6368982,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":49,"name":"Kansas","abbrev":"KS","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":120113,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-03T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120120,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-03T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120121,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-03T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120122,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-03T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120123,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":15,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120124,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-04T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":124883,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":124884,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":124885,"tournament_id":30523,"tournament":"2015 HFA Fall Classic","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":30524,"name":"HFA Fall Classic","start_date":"2015-10-03","end_date":"2015-10-04","comments":"1st Tournament of the 2014-2015 Heartland Circuit!

Masks and body cords will be checked for all events. In addition, lames will be checked for foil and lames\/cuffs for saber.

Be sure to set your clocks accordingly.\r\n\r\nINFORMAL ROUND ROBIN POOL\r\nWe are trying something new at this tournament. On Saturday after the 1st round of Senior Mixed Epee DE's, we are going to start an informal round robin pool. It will be one pool with however many people sign up. As more people get eliminated in DE's, they can also sign up as the pool is in process. The purpose of the pool is to allow more fencing for everybody. This pool will be self-reffed and it will be up to the participants to arrange the bouts with the other people in the pool whom they have not fenced yet. At the end of the day when the last official event is complete, whether or not the informal pool is complete, the winner will be determined by counting the victories and then indicators just like any other pool. The entry fee will be $5. If we are allowed we will donate all or a portion of the entry fees towards store credit at Sword Masters for the winner. \r\nIf this works out, we will have another Informal Round Robin Pool on Sunday in epee and maybe other weapons as well. \r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING FOOD IN THE VENUE: The Carter Fitness Center does not allow food and drink (other than water bottles) on the floor of the gym where the competition is being held.

Located in historic downtown Rogers since 1960 the museum houses an impressive airgun collection. In 1999, the company decided to utilize that\r\ncollection to create a first class and entertaining museum which would serve as a tourism attraction. In March, 2000, the refurbished, expanded museum opened its doors. Today, the museum resides in the brick-paved historic sector of downtown Rogers in a building which, itself, dates to 1896. It attracts over 1700 visitors a\r\nyear from almost every state in the continental U.S and several foreign countries. Gun and history enthusiasts come to see the collection of antique dating to the 1600s. www.daisymuseum.com\/\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/13\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/02\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Arkansas Fencing Center","address":"1100 SE 14th Street, Suite 16","city":"Bentonville","state":"AR","zip":"72712","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.3560215,"longitude":-94.1962161,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":67,"name":"Oklahoma","abbrev":"OK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":123786,"tournament_id":31413,"tournament":"Porthos","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-04T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":123787,"tournament_id":31413,"tournament":"Porthos","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-04T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":123788,"tournament_id":31413,"tournament":"Porthos","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-04T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":123789,"tournament_id":31413,"tournament":"Porthos","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":15,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-03T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":123790,"tournament_id":31413,"tournament":"Porthos","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-03T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":31418,"name":"OSU Open","start_date":"2015-10-03","end_date":"","comments":"A Rare Opportunity!\r\n\r\nThere will be 20 strips and some incredible fencing!\r\n\r\nSorry!!
