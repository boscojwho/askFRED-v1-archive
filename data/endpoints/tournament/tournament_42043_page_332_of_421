These are not the times that the events will actually start. Please arrive early to have your equipment checked (mask, lame, glove, 2 body cords, 2 mask cords), and allow time for warm-up and check-in.

The Registration fee ($25) will NOT be refunded, however the event fees ($25) may be refunded ONLY if requested in writing and received by 11\/12\/18.\r\n\r\nFencers MUST be Citizen or Permanent Resident (proof required).

(For instance, a fencer with Y14 National Points will be allowed to fence Cadet.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Tennessee Division Sanctioned event; ratings will be awarded where earned. Cadet events must be rated as a C1 or higher for any classifications to be awarded.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION FORMAT:\r\n\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination.\r\n\r\nQUALIFYING:\r\n\r\nThe top 25% (round up) of the field in an event will qualify for the Jr. Olympics in that event.  \r\n\r\nIf a fencer qualifies in the Jr. Event for one weapon, they will also qualify for the Cadet Event in that same weapon (ONLY if they are age eligible to compete in the Cadet category).\r\n\r\nWhen determining who has qualified for a Championship, only fencers who qualify through\r\nNational Points are skipped over to the next eligible fencer. Fencers that qualify for championships\r\nvia regional points are NOT skipped over. Those who qualify through the division should NOT be skipped.\r\nFor example, if a fencer competes and qualifies in a Junior division qualifier and is age eligible for Cadet,\r\nhe\/she will NOT get skipped over if they choose to also fence in the Cadet division qualifier. Those who\r\nqualify for Div IA, Div II, or Div III by earning regional ROC points are NOT considered automatic qualifiers at divisional qualifiers and should NOT be skipped over when determining qualifying places. \r\n\r\nUNIFORMS & EQUIPMENT:\r\n\r\nFencers are required to have complete fencing uniforms as required by USA Fencing. This includes the following items: Mask with two retaining devices aka straps (foil masks must have a conductive bib, Epee masks cannot have a conductive bib), mask cord (foil\/saber), jacket, plastron (underarm protector), knickers, lame (foil\/saber), glove (800N FIE required for saber), tall socks (must overlap knickers, proper footwear (no sandals, boots, heeled shoes, etc.), two working body cords and two working electric weapons.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>$60 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 10\/31. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).\r\n\r\n$75 at the door for late registrations (after 10\/31) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY).<\/b>\r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE:  9:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase. Pizza will be brought in for lunch at $2\/slice.\r\n \r\nOther helpful info:\r\n \r\n* 309 traffic can be busy so leave enough travel time. \r\n \r\n* Phone number is (215) 716-3777.

Names on uniforms are not required. Fencers should bring a minimum of two working weapons and body cords to the strip. Rain City Fencing Center has equipment available for purchase.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil (or sabre) masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2018-2019) competitive members of USA Fencing. Foreign fencers must obtain a Foreign Competitive membership from USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nFees and Registration:\r\n\r\nOn or before Friday, November 2nd:\r\n$20 registration\r\n$30 per event\r\n\r\nAfter Friday, November 2nd:\r\n$60 registration\r\n$90 per event\r\n\r\nNote, USA Fencing adds a $5 Admin Fee to your registration. This fee is mandated by USA Fencing and is not part of the entry fees we receive.\r\n\r\nAll registrations must be made through the USA Fencing event site here:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/details\/tournaments\/3183\r\n\r\nNo entries at the door will be permitted.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Pre-registration deadline is Friday, November 2nd. Registration is due by then to avoid triple entry fees!\r\n\r\nIn case you need to cancel your registration, you can request a refund of your event fees (registration fee is non-refundable). Refunds should be requested through the USA Fencing site before the event date. No refunds will be given after Friday, November 16th.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":164579,"tournament_id":41406,"tournament":"RCFC Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) -
