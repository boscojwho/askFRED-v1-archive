All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event.\r\n\r\nThe qualifier for the Y-14 and U-16 events will be held as a separate tournament on April 18th, 2009.  In prior years, we tried to cram these events into the same weekend as the Div II\/III events, but that has proven to be too much of a hassle for everyone.\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThis season, there are two ways to qualify for Division II and Division III events:\r\n\r\n1. Fence at this qualifier event and place in the top 25%\r\n2. Fence at Sectionals (in Alaska in May) and qualify for Division I-A. \r\n\r\nIn prior years, qualifying for Under-16 automatically qualified you for Div II\/III.  THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.  \r\n\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced (and no fee will be charged) since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule -----\r\nSaturday 4\/4\/09\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Foil\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Epee\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Saber\r\n\r\nSunday 4\/5\/09\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Epee\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Foil\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Saber\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe registration fee is $10 plus $10 per event entered.  Tournament fees can be pre-paid online on AskFRED when you register, or by cash or check on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Wednesday April 1st.  If you do not pre-register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.   \r\n\r\nFollow this link to pre-register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=8158\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nALL events will be run as two rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.  The combined results from the two pool rounds will be used to seed the DE tableau.  Depending on how many fencers attend, we may do a cut after the second round of pools. \r\n\r\nThis two-rounds-of-pools format has proven to be popular with the fencers since it gives everyone a lot of fencing.  It also tends to \"smooth out\" the seeding - if you fence poorly in the first round of pools, you can redeem yourself by fencing well in the second round.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nAll fencers must have been born in 1995 or earlier to fence in this event.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks.

Tournament cost is 10.00. \r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door.*\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Senior Circuit #4 and will be based on points earned in Senior Circuits #1-4.

Trophies will be awarded to the top 3 points earners in each series, respectively.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1)  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of participants equals the number of points.  So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points.  The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age by January 1st of the 2008-09 season or higher are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.  Trophies will be given out at the last tournament of each series.  If fencers, for whatever reason, cannot attend, prizes will be held for them at the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/01\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/11\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 S.W Western Ave","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35101,"tournament_id":7907,"tournament":"Senior Circuit #7","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-09T19:15:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7437,"name":"Kentucky Division SYC - 2009","start_date":"2009-04-10","end_date":"2009-04-12","comments":"Registration is $40 and each event is $35.

Preregistation closes completely April 3, 2009.  \r\n\r\nThe venue and hotel will be at the Galt House (at the same site).  Contact the hotel at (502) 589-5200.  Request the Fencing Super Youth Competition room block.\r\n\r\nRoom rates are $89 (and $119 and $199 for suites) plus tax.  A block of rooms with these rates have been extended through Apr 3, 2009.  Parking is $12\/ night.\r\n\r\nIf any other questions, please email Marcia Pierce,[Marcia.Pierce@EKU.EDU].\r\n\r\nWhy we are hosting an event on EASTER WEEKEND: \r\n\r\nKy Div had not any other option this year.  \r\n\r\nWe had reserved a weekend with the Clarion, but they were bought out and closed just 2 months ago.  \r\n\r\nThere are only about 3 hotels with convention space in Louisville large enough for this event (including the Clarion).  The Exec Inn did not have a large enough space available for 3 consecutive weekend days at all.\r\n\r\nThe Galt House and the Easter Weekend were our ONLY choice this year with such short notice.  Even the Galt House had to adjust some things to make this work. \r\n\r\nKy Div has started Sunday's events one hour later that the other two days.  In addition, we will be offering a short non-demoninatal service for those who would be interested on Sunday morning.  IN addition, there are several downtown churches including a Catholic cathedral.  If you wish to have additional information about churches within walking distance, please email the AskFred organizer.\r\n\r\nSummary: Next year we will not be hosting the SYC on Easter - but it was our only option this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Galt House","address":"140 North Fourth Street","city":"Louisville","state":"KY","zip":"40202","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":38.257566,"longitude":-85.756587,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":22,"name":"Kentucky","abbrev":"KY","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":33131,"tournament_id":7437,"tournament":"Kentucky Division SYC -

Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event. If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2. Events are mixed (boys and girls). Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender. (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3. Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments. Point standings will be posted at http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4. The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series.

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event unless they have sufficient national points to auto-qualify. \r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced (and no fee will be charged) since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule -----\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Foil\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Epee\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Saber\r\n\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Foil\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Epee\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Epee\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.  Fencers may enter multiple events per day, but they may be required to fence in both events simultaneously if necessary.  We may delay the start of some events in order to accomodate people fencing multiple events.  We will do our best to accomodate these fencers within the limits of the schedule.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that many of the events will be very small and either not be fenced at all (if 3 or fewer fencers show) or finish quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe registration fee is $10 plus $10 per event entered.  Tournament fees can be pre-paid online on AskFRED when you register, or by cash or check on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Wednesday April 15th.  If you do not pre-register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.  We will be enforcing this! \r\n\r\nFollow this link to pre-register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=8157\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nUnder-16 - Born 1993 - 1996\r\nYouth-14 - Born 1994 - 1997\r\n \r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict.\r\n\r\nFor info on petitions, contact chair@wwdfencing.org","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6150436,"longitude":-122.1717577,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":36311,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"U16 Men's Foil","short_name":"U16MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"U16","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36312,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"U16 Women's Foil","short_name":"U16WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"U16","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36313,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"U16 Men's Saber","short_name":"U16MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"U16","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36314,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"U16 Women's Saber","short_name":"U16WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"U16","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36315,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36316,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36317,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36319,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36320,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36321,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"U16 Men's Epee","short_name":"U16ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"U16","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":36322,"tournament_id":8157,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - U16 and Y14 Events","full_name":"U16 Women's Epee","short_name":"U16WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"U16","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":1,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-18T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":6370,"name":"Junior Progressive #3","start_date":"2009-04-18","end_date":"","comments":"This is the third of a four-tournament series.
