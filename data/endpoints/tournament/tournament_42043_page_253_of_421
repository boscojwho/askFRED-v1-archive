Both youth and adult fencers will compete in the same event. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we can show you). At minimum a US Fencing Association (USFA) non-competitive membership is required as is needed for fencing at MTFC due to liability insurance requirements. These events are not rated. The event will be limited to the first 24 fencers who preregister due to space and time considerations.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE\r\nThe basic entry fee is $20 per fencer.\r\nDiscount of $5 if you use your own electric gear.\r\nDiscount of $5 if you preregister on AskFRED.\r\n(If you use your own gear and sign up it is $10)\r\n\r\nReferees will not pay entry fees.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to use club gear, but plan to arrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also use electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with teams of 3 that are chosen in some fair, fun, or random way. Team captains who are the top fencers in the tournament will be separated to different teams. Fencer strength will be based on USFA classification followed by referee certification followed by MTFC points for this season. Teams will be balanced as much as possible. The rounds will be self-directed. Standard US Fencing Association team rules will apply. We will fence in a team relay format.\r\n\r\nDepending on the number of teams we may be able to hold 3 rounds lasting approximately 1 hour each to fence off each position. Final format will be determined by the number of teams.\r\n\r\nIf you are registered but do not show up and do not cancel your registration to allow other club members to participate then you may be \"accidentally\" removed from future in-house events.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/17\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/31\/2015.\r\n","venue":{"name":"MTFC","address":"1106 South 15th Street","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","zip":"98405","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.2477189,"longitude":-122.451121,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":126072,"tournament_id":31791,"tournament":"MTFC in-house Foil Team","full_name":"Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":31591,"name":"Fencers Club Youth 8-10-12-14 & Open Sabre","start_date":"2015-11-01","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for Y8-Y10-Y12-Y14 and Open Sabre events. $40 per event if pre-registered and paid online or $50 at the door (A-rated fencers pay $30 for open events).

Fencing Club Announces the 3rd annual Cherry City RYC for Region 1\r\n\r\nThis event is for youth in the Y10, Y12, and Y14 age categories, to help them gain experience in larger \"USFA-style\" competitions without having to travel out of their local region. (Region 1 includes WA, OR, ID, MT, and WY)\r\n\r\nEvents will be held in all three weapons and age categories, and medals awarded to the top three male and female fencers in each weapon\/category. Participation may qualify fencers for the Y10 or Y12 competitions at North American Cups (as age appropriate), or Summer Nationals. For details on the new qualification paths for youth, see: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources and click the \"Qualification\" tab at the bottom.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Note: At least 2 athletes must compete (have fenced) in a given RYC age\/weapon event to fulfill eligibility requirements. Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed will not result in the athlete fulfilling qualification requirement. i.e. Y14 events will need to have at least two athletes of the same gender to be a qualifying event.\r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD! All fencers must be current USFA members and be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership. Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. \r\n\r\nFull USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or sabre, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. All Y10 fencers will be required to use size \"0\" or size \"2\" blades (i.e., less than 32.5 inches long). Foil events require conductive foil masks.\r\n\r\nEquipment checks will be conducted. Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event. We will be open on Saturday at 7:00 a.m. for equipment checks. We encourage people for later events to check equipment early. If you are fencing Sunday, please come by on Saturday to get your stuff checked and approved, and help us reduce lines the day of your event. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAge Requirements (2015-2016 Season only):\r\nY10: Birth years of 2005 - 2008\r\nY12: Birth years of 2003 - 2006\r\nY14: Birth years of 2001 - 2004\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFred is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Tuesday Nov. 3, 2015 (i.e. FOUR days before the event) If you are pre-registered by the deadline, pay just $15 per fencer registration fee and $10 per event at the door (i.e. $25 for one event and $35 for two events.) After the close of regular pre-registration time to 9pm of the day prior to the tournament, fencers are welcome at triple registration fee and double event fee (i.e. $45 to register and $20 per event), if organizers are notified via email at info@salemfencingclub.org. The day of the event you may fence with a walk-in fee of double triple (i.e. $90 per fencer and $60 per event.) However, we don\u0092t want that, so please just register on time and save yourself some money.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that we only accept cash or checks. CREDIT CARDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED. Please make checks out to Salem Fencing Club. \r\n\r\nAffordable and healthy breakfast, lunch, snacks and beverages will be available onsite from local food carts each day.

events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event.  Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (patrick@nyacsabre.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (patrick@nyacsabre.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"195 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661857,"longitude":-73.9794418,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":124310,"tournament_id":31557,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup Sabre #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-07T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":31836,"name":"NJFA - Div II & VET M&W Saber November 7","start_date":"2015-11-07","end_date":"","comments":"Close of check-in promptly 9:00 AM!!

Our goal is to create a positive tournament experience and setting for every fencer, while providing a level of professionalism expected of an elite fencing center.\r\n\r\nThe SFSFL incorporates two Circuits within its infrastructure, The Junior & Open Circuit (JOC) and The Individual Challenge Circuit (ICC).  The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.  These ranking systems mirror that of the National Governing Body, USA Fencing, and the International Governing Body, Federation International de\u0092 Escrime (FIE).  Each tournament in the JOC will award fencers in the final four with medals.  Each tournament in the ICC will award the final eight fencers with medals.  These circuits also provide seasonal awards for Overall Ranking Champions and Individual Champions, as well as MVP, Coaches Awards, etc.\r\n\r\nEVENTS INCLUDE:\r\nOpen Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nJunior Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nDivision-3 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-12 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-10 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-8 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE: (all times = close of registration)\r\nSaturday:\r\n2pm \u0096 Division-3 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-8 Mixed Sabre\r\nSunday:\r\n10am \u0096 Open Mixed Sabre\r\n10am \u0096 Youth-12 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Junior Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-10 Mixed Sabre\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\nSabre Outreach Network\r\nDuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center\r\n3017 NW 60th St\r\nFort Lauderdale, FL  33308\r\n\r\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\r\n954-990-0090\r\nMitchB5659@comcast.net\r\nDan.Berliner@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/28\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/08\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"DuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center","address":"3017 NW 60th St","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state":"FL","zip":"33309","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":26.2007656,"longitude":-80.1860775,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":120270,"tournament_id":30559,"tournament":"The Turkey Stab - SFSFL #3","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":0,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-07T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120271,"tournament_id":30559,"tournament":"The Turkey Stab - SFSFL #3","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y8MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-07T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120272,"tournament_id":30559,"tournament":"The Turkey Stab - SFSFL #3","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-08T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120273,"tournament_id":30559,"tournament":"The Turkey Stab - SFSFL #3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-08T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120274,"tournament_id":30559,"tournament":"The Turkey Stab - SFSFL #3","full_name":"Junior Mixed Saber","short_name":"JrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-08T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120275,"tournament_id":30559,"tournament":"The Turkey Stab - SFSFL #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-08T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
