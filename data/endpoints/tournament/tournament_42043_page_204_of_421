If you fence in the Youth 10 or Youth 12 event at this tournament, you are qualified for the same event at the National level.  If there are fewer than 4 entrants in an event, we will combine the men's and women's events.\r\n\r\nAs an additional qualification path to Y14 National Championships -  Place first in the Y14 event at a current-season RYC tournament.  To enable qualification, we will fence both men's and women's Y14 events regardless of the number entered.\r\n\r\nThis tournament is sanctioned by the USA Fencing Regional tournament rules.

Restaurants and micro-breweries are varied and plentiful. The Hilton Gardens is a brief RTD light rail trip to, and the downtown Courtyard Marriott and Embassy Suites are within easy walking distance of, the Denver Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, the Pepsi Center, Coors Field, the newly opened History Colorado Center, and the Denver Art Museum. In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly. REI\u0092s flagship store, with its four story climbing wall, the Downtown Aquarium, and Elitch Gardens amusement park are about 1.3 mile walks.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to range a bit further, The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a can\u0092t miss attraction for lovers of all things dinosaur. Next door to the Museum of Nature and Science is the Denver Zoo. The new Elephant Passage exhibit recently opened. See\u00a0http:\/\/www.denver.org\u00a0for detailed information about even more events and performances.\r\n\r\nWe have worked with these hotels in the past, and they score very well on tripadvisor.com.\r\n\r\nHotel suggestions:\r\n\r\nEmbassy Suites Denver - Downtown\/Convention Center\r\n1420 Stout Street 80202\r\nhttp:\/\/embassysuites3.hilton.com\/en\/hotels\/colorado\/embassy-suites-denver-downtown-convention-center-DENESES\/index.html\r\n\r\nMarriott Courtyard Denver Downtown\r\n934 16th St. Denver, CO 80202\r\nhttp:\/\/www.marriott.com\/hotels\/travel\/dencd-courtyard-denver-downtown\/\r\n\r\nHilton Garden Inn Denver Tech Center\r\n7675 East Union Ave. Denver, CO 80237\r\nhttp:\/\/hiltongardeninn3.hilton.com\/en\/hotels\/colorado\/hilton-garden-inn-denver-tech-center-DENTRGI\/index.html\r\n\r\nThe Denver Super Shuttle can be used to reach the hotels from the airport.\r\nHere is a link to the Denver Super Shuttle:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.supershuttle.com\/Locations\/DENAirportShuttleDenver.aspx\r\n\r\nThe Denver RTD Light Rail can be used to reach the Evans station, which is the closest station to DFC.

Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once the DE round starts and the tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be allowed.  The fencer\u0092s signature on the pool sheet or DE slip implies accuracy and acceptance. \r\n\r\nSeeding: \r\nSeeding is based initially on the fencers Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then their letter ranking with the year of classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. \r\nOnly ratings and points standings listed on the USFA website will be used. Check your rating at http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx and national point standing at http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Athlete-Info.aspx\r\n\r\nEach event consists of two rounds (pools and direct elimination)\r\nPools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round.\r\nDirect Elimination Tableau shall be generated from the results of the preliminary pool round.\r\nY 10 DE format - Y10 direct elimination bouts will be for 10 touches or will end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 touches are scored, whichever comes first.  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nY 12 & Y14 DE format - direct elimination bouts will be for 15 touches or will end when 3 periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period have passed.

There are no fence-offs for third place.\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events do not use the E1 or D1 classifications. This means that these events are not rated until they achieve the C1 level or higher. See the USFA ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\nPhotography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws or who is excluded is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not competed.\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout his opponent will be declared the winner of that bout.
