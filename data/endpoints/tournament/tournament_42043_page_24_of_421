Go west   Approximately three miles. Cross over Buford Highway. Make an immediate right onto  Brogden Road which is just over the railroad tracks immediately past Buford Hwy. Go  approximately one mile to Mendi Court. North GA Fencing Center is at the far left corner of Brogden Road and Mendi Court.    \r\n\r\nFrom Georgia Highway 400: Take exit # 14. Turn right onto highway 20 and travel approximately 10 miles. Turn right onto Suwanee Dam Road and travel approximately 5  miles crossing over Peachtree Industrial Road. Turn left onto Brogden Road which is  just before the railroad tracks at Buford Highway. Go approximately one mile to Mendi  Court. North GA Fencing Center is at the far left corner of Brogden Road and Mendi Court. \r\n\r\nFencers must be US Citizens or permanent residents of the United States who meet  qualification standards specified below to enter USFA National Championships.   \r\n\r\nFencers must be able to show a USFA \u00e2\u0080\u009cCompetitive Member\u00e2\u0080\u009d card with an expiration date of 7\/31\/07 or later and have the Georgia Division as their recorded  division. For the Under 17 (Cadet) Junior Olympic Championship events, fencers must be born  between 1990 and 1993. If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at  the Division Qualifier if the fencer is on the Youth 14 national point standings. Fencers  who are on the national Cadet point standings on January 17, 2007, or, who are  among the top 8 of the Youth 14 national point standings on January 17, 2007, are  automatically (or pre-) qualified to compete in the 2007 Junior Olympic Championships.  If a fencer has not met either of these pre-qualification criteria, then the fencer must  have fenced in his or her Division Qualifier and finished in the top 25% of the field of  fencers for that event.    For the Under 20 (Junior) Junior Olympic Championship events, fencers must be born  between 1987 and 1993. If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at  the Division Qualifier if the fencer is on the Cadet point standings. Pre-qualfiers  for the  Junior Championships are those on the national Junior point standings as of January  17, 2007, or in the top 16 of the national Cadet point standings as of January 17, 2007.  Otherwise the fencers must qualify from their Division qualifying competition by placing  in the top 25% of the field. In exceptional cases, a member of the USFA in good standing may qualify by petition.  A successful petition would come from a fencer who qualified for the same competition  the prior season, or whose current competitive record indicates a strong possibility that  he or she would have qualified  had he or she been able to compete in the qualifying  tournament. For information on procedures for qualifying by petition, please consult the  downloadable USFA Athlete handbook at www.usfencing.org. Note: No petition may  contravene the results of a qualifying competition\u00e2\u0080\u0093 a fencer who has fenced in the  competition without withdrawing due to valid medical reasons cannot then petition to  disregard or override those results.\r\n\r\nDetermination of the number of Qualifiers based on the 25% rule:  If fewer than 3 fencers are entered for any event, the event will not be fenced and the entrants will be automatically qualified.   \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n=======================================================\r\nWAIVER\r\n=======================================================\r\nALL ENTRANTS MUST READ AND SIGN EACH OF THE FOLLOWING STATEMENTS:  (Entrants under age 18 must have parent or legal guardian sign)    Waiver of liability: Upon entering this tournament under the auspices of the Georgia Division of the  USFA, I agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA.

Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector).  A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year).  Entry fees.  A water bottle.  Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door.  There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up.  Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES!  Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred.  (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in convertion.)
