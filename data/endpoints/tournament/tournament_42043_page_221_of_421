This RJCC will provide a qualifying path for Junior Olympics. National RJCC Points will be awarded to those fencers placing in the top 40% of the competitive field regardless of where the cut occurs. Fencers in the top 32 of this points list, who are not auto-qualifiers, will be qualified for Junior Olympics. \r\n\r\nThe Athlete\u0092s Handbook:(http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698380-athlete-handbook) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for summer nationals and should be used as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net.

Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9585322,"longitude":-75.1930377,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108111,"tournament_id":27329,"tournament":"FAP E Sabre","full_name":"EUnder Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"E-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-09-20T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27615,"name":"Mountaineer Open Free Tournament.","start_date":"2014-09-20","end_date":"2014-09-21","comments":"All event costs are covered by the App State Fencing Club.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  <b>There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.<\/b>  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2013-14 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2014, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1994-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1995-2001 and for the cadet events 1998-2001.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"195 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661745,"longitude":-73.9794156,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":105931,"tournament_id":26755,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #1 Men's Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":25,"prereg_count":28,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-09-21T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":26756,"name":"Dernell Every Memorial Youth Tournament","start_date":"2014-09-21","end_date":"","comments":"The Dernell Every Memorial Youth tournament is open to all USFA members.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

A fourth fencer can be allowed on the team as an alternate, but as soon as the fourth has been subbed in, they cannot leave and must fence to the completion of the event. The opposing team must be alerted of this substitution at least one round before it happens.\r\n\r\nThe modern team competition is similar to the pool round of the individual competition. The fencers from opposing teams will each fence each other once, making for a total of nine matches. At the beginning of the team match, each team fills out one side of a score sheet with the order they will fence in. Teams are not aware of the order their opponents will be fencing in, although the sheet is designed so that no two athletes will fence each other twice.\r\n\r\nMatches (or bouts) between teams are three minutes long, or to 5 points, as in the pools. There are important differences, however: each match the score carries over, and the maximum score for each match is increased by 5. For example, lets imagine that Fencer A from Team 1 and Fencer X from Team 2 finish their first bout at 5-3. Next, Fencer B and Fencer Y step on the piste. They will be fencing to 10 points, but Fencer B starts at 5, and Fencer Y starts at 3, right where their team-mates left them. This means that Fencer Y can still pull ahead, if she scores 7 points before Fencer B scores 5.\r\n\r\nImagine, however, things go slowly, and after three minutes the total score is 8-6. Although neither fencer reached the limit of 10 total points for this match, the next pair to fence will still be able to go as high as 15. In other words, the maximum score for each round continues increasing by 5 regardless of how many points were scored in the previous match.\r\n\r\nSince there are 9 matches, the highest score possible is 45 points. However, the winner is simply the team with the highest score at the end of the ninth match, even if it is less than 45. While sabre almost inevitably goes to 45, it is not unusual to see an \u00e9p\u00e9e score in the mid to low thirties. If there is a tie at the end of the ninth match, then the usual tie-breaking rules apply, and it is the same two fencers who will do the tie-breaker match.\r\n\r\nTeam tournaments sometimes use pools and elimination rounds, although this is not so common, and they usually begin in a direct elimination format. The seeding of the teams in this case can be random, or based on the performance of the individual members (if it is a tournament with both), or even based on the results of the same team at other tournaments (for example if it is a national team). \r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Carlisle Fencing Club -- Stuart Community Center","address":"415 Franklin St.","city":"Carlisle","state":"PA","zip":"17013","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2076765,"longitude":-77.1979589,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":27,"name":"Harrisburg","abbrev":"HARR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108301,"tournament_id":27395,"tournament":"Harrisburg Division Youth Sabre\/Epee Team Events","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-09-27T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108302,"tournament_id":27395,"tournament":"Harrisburg Division Youth Sabre\/Epee Team Events","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Team Saber","short_name":"MxSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-09-27T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27930,"name":"San Diego Cup - Y10\/12\/14 Sabre","start_date":"2014-09-27","end_date":"","comments":"Official San Diego Cup event.

She was ready. Loretta was preceded by her husband William L Nikolai, Jr., and three of her six siblings. She left behind her two children Bill (William L, III) and Ann, both of whom currently reside in Salt Lake City; and three grandchildren Kenneth, Travis and Will (William L, IV).\r\nLoretta was a good woman with a good intellect. She was well-read at a time when women were generally encouraged to read nothing more challenging than a recipe book. As a young woman, she earned a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology. Decades later she returned to college to obtain a Master's Degree in Counseling. Although she was, as a rule, neither a vain nor prideful woman, she found the achievement gratifying. While Loretta, like all humans, had faults and foibles, she balanced them with a lifetime of charitable works and social and political activism.

You must be an active member of MTFC with both an up-to-date club membership as well as a current 2014-2015 membership to the US Fencing Association (non-competitive membership is fine) to participate.\r\n\r\nSince the Y10 and Y12 fencers in the area have fewer opportunities for tournaments and practice, we invite all youth fencers from any club with an active club membership, active 2014-2015 USFA membership, and current national points for foil in the Y10 and Y12 age groups to join us.\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: MTFC Sharks and Minnows\r\nDate: 9\/27\/2014\r\nClose of Registration: 12:30 PM\r\nTournament Size Restriction: 24 fencers\r\nLocation: Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Tacoma, WA\r\n\r\nWe are physically located at 1106 South 15th Street, Tacoma, WA 98405 in the Sons of Norway building called \"Normanna Hall\" at the corner of 15th and Martin Luther King. Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 12:30 PM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $5 for the event.\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT RENTAL: $15 if you need to rent equipment.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. Adults and children with all different levels of experience will be fencing together. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we will show you if needed). \r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $15 for the event, but plan to arrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through an electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nThis is a sharks and minnows foil event which is not a standard USFA format but provides better opportunity for practice. We will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools as is standard for USFA tournaments. There will be a second round of pools to follow with a separate \"sharks\" group for the top 6 fencers (after the first round of pools) who will be protected to advance to the direct elimination round. All the \"minnows\" will be sorted based on their first round pool performance for their second round of pools with other minnows. Direct eliminations will follow based on the second round of pools (the sharks have a guaranteed spot) adding some of the the top seeded fencers in the minnows group after the second round of pools. Not everyone will advance to direct eliminations though this format will allow two rounds of pools with the second round more equal in fencing strength which is more and better fencing for everyone. It is expected that the direct elimination round will consist of the top 8 fencers only. Those who are eliminated after the pools are encouraged to watch the higher level fencers, ask questions, and learn some new tricks as well as enjoy the company of other MTFC fencers and families.\r\n\r\nThe rounds will be self-directed. Because this will be a mixed tournament with combined youth and adult fencers, direct elimination will be a standard 15 point, 3 period format unless either of the fencers in a direct elimination bout is 10 years old or younger in which case the format will be 10 points, 2 periods as is standard for all 10 and under events. Additionally, if either fencer is veteran age (40 years old and above) the direct elimination rounds can be 10 points, 2 periods as is standard for veteran events.\r\n\r\n------------------ Coach Toby Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis tournament is restricted due to club space availability to the first 24 fencers who preregister on AskFRED. If you register and take a spot but do not show up for the event, Coach Toby will be very disappointed, and you may find that your future in-house registrations may unexpectedly get cancelled. When you register for the event on AskFRED you will receive an e-mail with a link to unregister yourself in case you find that you cannot attend. Please be respectful of other club members.

This policy drastically reduces the number of no-shows and is in-line with that of Central Florida Division.\r\n\r\nEvent fees are refundable prior to the close of registration.\r\n\r\nLate registrations are not generally accepted, unless adding a fencer will help the event.  Late registrations are double the fees.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>FORMAT POLICY<\/b>\r\nEvents with less than 4 will be cancelled and money promptly returned.  Events with less than 8 will not include direct eliminations.  The standard pool and DE format will be used otherwise.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CONDUCT POLICY<\/b>\r\nWe want everyone to have fun in a positive-stress environment and to enjoy their day with us.  To help us keep the tournament moving swiftly and to avoid drama as much as possible, we strictly enforce the following:\r\n\r\nZERO TOLERANCE FOR POOR CONDUCT.  This applies to every human soul in the venue.  Do not test our resolve.  If the situation arises (and it never has at one of our tournaments), a black card report will be submitted to the USFA.\r\n\r\nDO NOT ASK TO REPLACE A REFEREE.  We go above and beyond to select the best referees the local community has to offer.  You are assured a level-playing field with competent officials.  Expect to be carded accordingly for delaying the bout or not following the referee's directions.\r\n\r\nFENCERS MAKING UNUSTIFIED APPEALS WILL BE PENALIZED (t.122). Calling for a bout committee delays the tournament, so please make sure you are \"fighting the good fight\".  Appeals can only be made on misapplication of the rules, not point-of-fact calls.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SAFETY AND ARMORY POLICY<\/b>\r\nMasks and body cords will be tested as usual.  Full fencing attire is required, including socks that meet the knee.
