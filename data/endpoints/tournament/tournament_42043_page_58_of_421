How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"waiting\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Waiting list policy:<\/b>\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"policy\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/05\/2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30753,"tournament_id":6865,"tournament":"Novice Cadet & Adult Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-09T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6380,"name":"Chicago Lakeshore Fencers Club Open","start_date":"2008-11-09","end_date":"","comments":"A single event is $25 with preregistration, $35 at the door.\r\n\r\nFor two events, the cost with preregistration is $35.

I intend to \u00e2\u0080\u009csteal\u00e2\u0080\u009d this idea and make it an annual event in our Division. Thanks to Mike Tarascio for sharing his inspiration.

Might oaks from small acorns grow, and this event is sure to generate interest and, ultimately, the tangible benefit of funds to contribute to the goal of eliminating breast cancer.

If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n","venue":{"name":"FAP","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30754,"tournament_id":6866,"tournament":"C Epee","full_name":"Div2 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-16T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6635,"name":"Under 17 Junior Olympics Epee Qualifier","start_date":"2008-11-16","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2008-08-30","prereg_close":"2008-11-15","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"BFC - Columbia","address":"9515 Gerwig Lane, Suite 101","city":"Columbia","state":"MD","zip":"21046","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.171657,"longitude":-76.840711,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":29899,"tournament_id":6635,"tournament":"Under 17 Junior Olympics Epee Qualifier","full_name":"Cadet Women's Epee","short_name":"CdWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-16T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29901,"tournament_id":6635,"tournament":"Under 17 Junior Olympics Epee Qualifier","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-16T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6653,"name":"Under 17 Junior Olympics Wm Foil Qualifier","start_date":"2008-11-16","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2008-08-30","prereg_close":"2008-11-15","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"BFC - Columbia","address":"9515 Gerwig Lane, Suite 101","city":"Columbia","state":"MD","zip":"21046","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.171657,"longitude":-76.840711,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":29956,"tournament_id":6653,"tournament":"Under 17 Junior Olympics Wm Foil Qualifier","full_name":"Cadet Women's Foil","short_name":"CdWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-16T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7143,"name":"Fishkill Fencers","start_date":"2008-11-19","end_date":"","comments":"Registration 7:30 - 8 pm\r\n$10 Entry Fee","prereg_open":"2008-10-14","prereg_close":"2008-11-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Registration 7:30 - 8 pm\r\n$10 Entry Fee\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\nPlease be advised that preregistration is not required.

The first series of tournaments will be exclusively foil; the second will be epee.\r\n\r\nNWFC Senior Circuit #3 is the third of the first series of 4 tournaments designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer.  Awards are based on the fencer's top 3 results.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events.  Pre-registration cost is 10.00; late registration (at the door\/walk-in) is 15.00.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Senior Circuit #4 and will be based on points earned in Senior Circuits #1-4.  The first series will be entirely foil.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Senior Circuit #8 and will be based on Senior Circuits #5-8. The second series will be exclusively epee.  Trophies will be awarded to the top 3 points earners in each series, respectively.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1)  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of participants equals the number of points.  So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points.  The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or higher are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.  Trophies will be given out at the last tournament of each series.  If fencers, for whatever reason, cannot attend, prizes will be held for them at the center.\r\n\r\n    \r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/30\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/19\/2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Avenue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.48434,"longitude":-122.782564,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":31304,"tournament_id":7037,"tournament":"Senior Circuit #3","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-20T19:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
