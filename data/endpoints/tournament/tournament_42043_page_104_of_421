This event kiosk will consist of a LCD monitor with a mouse. The live results web site will be displayed so that fencers\/coaches\/parents will be able to navigate through all of the event data. When pools or DE's are called, you can see where you need to be on either the LCD monitor that we've always had, on the new event kiosk, or on your Internet-enabled mobile device.\r\n\r\nMOBILE ACCESS\r\nIf you have a Internet-enabled mobile device you may be able to view the live results on your own device eliminating the need to stand around either monitor. To see if your mobile device is compatible, you can see if the live link below will display on your device.\r\nAmarillo Open Live Results - http:\/\/amarilloopen.com\/results\/amarillo\/\r\n\r\nSET YOUR CLOCKS\r\nFor those coming from other time zones, Amarillo is in the Central Time Zone. Be sure to set your clocks accordingly.\r\n\r\nFENCER CONTACT LIST\r\nWe are trying something new this year to help locate missing fencers, including those who have not checked in just before an event and those who are not at the assigned strip for pools or a DE bout. We will announce the missing fencer's name via the PA system; however, if you wish to add your name and contact number number via the link below, we will also call or text you from the bout committee. This may help if you happen to be out of ear shot of the PA system in the main gym. Of course this is no guarantee that you'll answer the call if we try to contact you, but it may help your chances of not missing out of an event.\r\nhttps:\/\/spreadsheets.google.com\/viewform?hl=en&formkey=dFQyS3pUak1McWJIdktnQ0tfYW93V1E6MQ#gid=0\r\n\r\nANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING FOOD IN THE VENUE: The Carter Fitness Center does not allow food and drink (other than water bottles) on the floor of the gym where the competition is being held.

Test your mettle and especially your balance against other wannabe pirates as we simulate \"epic duels upon the high seas\"** to see who will become the new Pirate King and who will just <i>walk the plank!<\/i>\r\n\r\n**Rocking ships, blunderbusses and cannon balls are not included.\r\n\r\nThe tournament is open to all ages.  Awards will be given out to the Overall winners, Best in Y12 age competitors and Best in Y10 age competitors.  \r\n\r\n\r\nCost to compete is $20.

I intend to \u00e2\u0080\u009csteal\u00e2\u0080\u009d this idea and make it an annual event in our Division. Thanks to Mike Tarascio for sharing his inspiration.

Might oaks from small acorns grow, and this event is sure to generate interest and, ultimately, the tangible benefit of funds to contribute to the goal of eliminating breast cancer. As I remember my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final year dealing with the consequences of breast cancer, I am very pleased to see my other family, the fencing community, take up the cause.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.

The fee at the door will be $10 registration fee PLUS $10 per event.\r\n\r\nThere will be an awards table for the top finishers to choose their prize.

The events will alternate between foil and epee.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments are designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer. There are four tournaments per weapon. There will be a point system for Epee and Foil. Awards will be given to the top three fencers in the points standings at the last tournaments (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). The points system is described below.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events. Tournament cost is $10.00 if you preregister on AskFRED. $15.00 to register at the door.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1) Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments. Awards will be given out at the last tournament of each weapon (Senior Circuit #7 & #8).
