Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership at the tournament. New and renewed memberships will carry through to the end of next season.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1998-2001\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1996-1999\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=15196\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/11\/2011\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
