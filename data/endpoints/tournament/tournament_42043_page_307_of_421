All teen fencers of all skill level are welcome.  You do not have to be a hot shot competitor or be interested in competing at Junior Olympics to enjoy this tournament, meet other fencers your age, and gain valuable experience.  You do need to have a competitive US Fencing membership (if you are currently a noncompetitive member, you must upgrade to competitive status before the tournament, by going to www.usfencing.org).\r\n\r\nThere are event for two age groups:\r\nCadet: teens born 2001-04.  These events are only for younger teens\r\nJunior: teens born 1998-2004.  These events are open to both younger and older teens\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to make a day of it, and sign up for at least 2 events, depending on your age and which weapon(s) you fence.  While you may sign up for 4 or more events, that takes a lot of stamina, so unless you are a pretty hardcore athlete, 2-3 events is a good number in one day.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $15 for your first event, plus $5 per additional event.   Note that unlike most GMD events, where the price goes up after the preregistration date, for this tournament, registration actually closes and you will not be able to sign up after October

Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/12\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/11\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.244807,"longitude":-75.142587,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":149956,"tournament_id":37785,"tournament":"Liberty FC Sabre Marathon","full_name":"Senior Mixed Marathon Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"Marathon","close_of_reg":"2017-11-11T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":37842,"name":"Veteran's Day tournament","start_date":"2017-11-11","end_date":"","comments":"A good day to be a foilist.

Since our flood insurance was turned down on a technicality, this was an enormously helpful lifeline, in helping us recover from this disaster; as was some very generous donations and loans from our membership and other individual fencers outside our membership.\r\n\r\n<b>IT IS NOW OUR TURN TO GIVE BACK & PAY IT FORWARD!   <\/b>\r\n\r\nThe BCAF is designating our Foil and Epee Opens, scheduled for November 12th at Lambertville, to be a fundraiser for clubs damaged by Hurricane Harvey in Texas, Hurricane Irma in Florida, and now, potentially, clubs damaged in the unprecedented wildfires sweeping California.   The proceeds will be donated to the USFA disaster relief fund, which was set up following Hurricane Harvey in Texas, and will now oversee the ongoing dispersal of funds specifically to clubs in disaster recovery.  Any additional donations you would like to make will also be forwarded to the USFA fund.    \r\n\r\nThis event is sanctioned by USA Fencing's New Jersey Division. Open to fencers born 2004 or earlier. Medals and classifications will be awarded.\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free onsite parking! Free wireless internet!\r\n\r\n10 minute walk on scenic tow path to historic Lambertville full of shops & dining!\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2017-2018 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-Lambertville Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women in each weapon event). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 11\/8\/18.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $40 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

We intend to host one each month through Wheelchair Championships and Summer Nationals as warm-ups.  We will be adjusting things as we learn how such things go, so join in and help us develop!\r\n\r\nWeapons check will be available for your peace of mind, but not required.  800 Newton Saber gloves are required for sanctioned events\r\n\r\nUtah Swords Academy hosts the Utah Fencing Foundation's wheelchair fencing program and, after separate warmups and drills, we routinely rotate all students to fence seated with our wheelchair fencers.  For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs.  Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated.  If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get really good with blade-work.   Visualize every bout starting with you being backed up to the end of the strip.  Try it - you'll like it!  The Saturday 'Walk and Roll' saber event is scheduled between the youth and senior events so that youth can stay after and fence seated and seniors can come early and warm up fencing seated.  Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.  \r\n  ","venue":{"name":"Utah Swords Academy Fencing Club","address":"3536 South West Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","zip":"84115","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":40.6945331,"longitude":-111.8949921,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":12,"name":"Utah-Southern Idaho","abbrev":"UT-SID","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":155485,"tournament_id":39009,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #5, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Any-Age, Walk and Roll Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":17,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"Any-Age, Walk and Roll","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":155486,"tournament_id":39009,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #5, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":155487,"tournament_id":39009,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #5, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":155488,"tournament_id":39009,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #5, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-17T18:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":155489,"tournament_id":39009,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #5, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-17T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":155541,"tournament_id":39009,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #5, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Any-Age, Walk and Roll Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"Any-Age, Walk and Roll","close_of_reg":"2017-11-20T18:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":37527,"name":"Friday Night Fight at NWFC (Epee only)","start_date":"2017-11-17","end_date":"","comments":"Join the fencers from the NWFC Adult Camp for the Friday Night Fight tournament.\r\nThis is a Epee only event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2017-07-28","prereg_close":"2017-11-16","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":10,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"<b>Friday Night Fight at Northwest Fencing Center<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul>Join fencers from the NWFC Adult Epee Camp for the Friday Night Fight Tournament.\r\n<b>This is a USFencing sanctioned events and new ratings may be earned.<\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Events, Schedule, and Formula<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li><b>Events:<\/b> Open Epee.<\/li>\r\n<li>Check-in will close at 6:45 PM and events will start at 7:00 PM.<\/li>\r\n<li>The formula for the event will be decided on site in order to provide the best experience for all fencers.

Our address is 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 10:30 AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 for the event.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE DISCOUNTS (may be combined): $5 off if preregistered on AskFRED because everyone should use AskFRED, $5 off for fencers with a classification (rating) as we want to encourage our most experienced members to participate as well and be role models for our beginners, and $5 off for rated referees who will help referee during this event.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. Adults and children with all different levels of experience will be fencing together. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen because it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nBeginners are welcome to use club electric equipment. Competitive fencers are expected to use their own equipement. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR FOIL\r\n\r\nThis is a sharks and minnows foil event which is not a typical USFA format but provides better opportunity for practice. We will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools as is standard for USFA tournaments. There will be a second round of pools to follow with a separate \"sharks\" group for the top fencers (after the first round of pools) who will be protected to advance to the direct elimination round. All the \"minnows\" will be sorted based on their first round pool performance for their second round of pools with other minnows. Direct eliminations will follow based on the second round of pools likely only from the Sharks pool. Not everyone will advance to direct eliminations though this format will allow two rounds of pools with the second round more equal in fencing strength which is more and better fencing for everyone. Those who are eliminated after the pools are encouraged to watch the higher level fencers, ask questions, and learn some new tricks as well as enjoy the company of other MTFC fencers and families.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR EPEE\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of event which is likely smaller than the foil group the anticipated format with be standard pools, 100% promotion to direct eliminations, and a full direct elimination round.\r\n\r\nREFEREEING\r\n\r\nThe rounds will be self-directed by fencers who are rated referees and claim their $5 discount.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee and Mixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/31\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/17\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":155205,"tournament_id":38969,"tournament":"MTFC In-House Foil and Epee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":13,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":155206,"tournament_id":38969,"tournament":"MTFC In-House Foil and Epee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":37185,"name":"Turkey Day Slay at NKFA","start_date":"2017-11-18","end_date":"","comments":"Turkey Day - most stabbing fun, with a side of stuffing! \r\nUSFA competitive membership required.\r\nCost: $25, $35 for 2, and $45 for 3 events.

All fencers on the notification list will receive an email when one of the tournament administrators becomes aware that a spot has opened up on the pre-registration list.\r\n\r\nWalk-ins will only be accepted if there is a vacancy on the day of the tournament.  Any fencer who arrives on the day of the tournament as a walk-in entry and checks in with the registration table will be placed on a list on a first-come first-served basis to become a walk-in entry if a pre-registered fencer drops out or is not present at the close of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\nModern Duelists Fencing Academy is located inside the Triumph Industrial Park at 505 Blue Ball Rd, Elkton, MD 21921.
