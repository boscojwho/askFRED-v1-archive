The second round of pools will include one pool with the top fencers fighting to see who is the top shark (and who are the baby sharks doo doo doo doo doo doo....). Everyone else will have a second round of pools without the meanie sharks (the minnows). Perhaps only the top two fencers from the sharks pool will fence a 15 point direct elimination bout to entertain everyone else depending on how tired everyone is. The best guess right now is that the event should take 3-4 hours though if you have to leave after one round of pools that is okay (1.5-2 hours).\r\n\r\nWe are hoping that this will be a nice, relaxed, fun, social event for all of us.\r\n\r\nEvent fee is $20 per fencer, billed to your MTFC account if you sign up on AskFRED (right here). Event fee is $30 per fencer billed to your MTFC account if you show up and have not signed up on AskFRED--just sign up now! If you are a rated fencer or rated referee and is chosen to referee then you will get a $20 discount to the event.\r\n\r\nWe plan to follow current USA Fencing COVID masking tournament rules which states that fencers can compete without face masks (but fencing masks are still required).

As a youth of 18, while vacationing with his parents, he was challenged to a duel by an Italian nobleman who mistakenly assumed he had designs on a young lady.  He won the duel, which was fought with epees.  He had a distinguished career as an architect in Washington D.C. and returned to fencing at the NIH club in the 1990's, when he was in his 70's. He went to England on one of the first USA Veteran teams before World Veteran Championships were officially recognized.

You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up.
