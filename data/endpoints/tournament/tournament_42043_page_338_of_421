Refund requests must be received by Friday, February 1st.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Venue Information ----------\r\n\r\nThe event will be held at:\r\nRain City Fencing Center\r\n1776 136th Place NE\r\nBellevue, WA 98005\r\n(425) 747-6300\r\n\r\nFor directions, see http:\/\/www.raincityfencing.com\/about-us\/contact\/. Note that due to light rail construction in our area, access to RCFC is only from the south. See the map on our website for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Tournament Rules ----------\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USA Fencing. You may join or renew your membership while registering online. Foreign fencers must be current members of their nation's fencing federation AND register for a USA Fencing \"Foreign Fencer\" membership.\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform according to USA Fencing rules is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names are NOT required on fencer uniforms.\r\n\r\nFor foil, masks with electric bibs are required for all events.\r\n\r\nFor epee, a conductive surface can ground out the opponent's weapon. Epee fencers may NOT wear electric foil or saber masks. Two-weapon fencers must have two masks, or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nIn all three weapons, hard plastic chest protectors are required for women and optional for men. In foil, fencers who wear a chest protector must have padding with an approved FIE mark. RCFC expects to have a limited quantity of the new chest protectors available for purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Age Eligibility ----------\r\n\r\nSince this RJCC is after the entry deadline for Junior Olympics, age eligibility includes the 2019-2020 season.\r\n\r\nEligibility is based on birth year, regardless of the specific day\/month:\r\n\r\nCadet: Born in 2002 through 2006\r\nJunior: Born in 1999 through 2006\r\n\r\nFencers with Youth-14 National points are eligible to fence in Cadet events.\r\nFencers with Cadet National points are eligible to fence in Junior events.\r\n\r\nIf your USA Fencing membership card does not indicate \"DOB: VERIFIED\", please bring a form of government-issued ID or photocopy of a birth certificate for age verification.\r\n\r\nFencers aging out of their age group (2002 for Cadet, 1999 for Junior) can fence and earn classifications but will not earn points.\r\n\r\n---------- Event Seeding ----------\r\n\r\nFencers' classifications and club and division affiliations will be validated against the USA Fencing membership database as of February 1st.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>$60 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 2\/6. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).\r\n\r\n$75 at the door for late registrations (after 2\/6) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY).<\/b>\r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE:  9:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Our address is 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 11:00 AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $15 if pre-registered by February 9 on AskFred, $20 at the door. You are already reading the information so just go up and click the \"Preregister\" button right now....\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is an event for fencers born in 2004 or later (Youth 14 or younger). If you are old like Coach Toby and try to register you will not be allowed.\r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. You cannot earn any national points. But maybe if you are good or lucky you can go next door to the boba shop. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen 'cause it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nWe have equipment available to rent for $15 (MTFC Members no charge).  If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR FOIL\r\nThis is a mixed gender, mixed age event. To spice things up and get more fencing in for everyone we are likely going to do a sharks-and-minnows format. In this format there is the usual first round of pools with seeded fencers separated. So each pool will have pretty experienced fencers mixed in with beginners. Those who do the best in the first round (the sharks) will be put together for the second round of pools. And everyone else (the minnows) will also have a second round among themselves. That way the sharks can beat each other up. And the minnows can have a more even chance to be the biggest guppy. At least the top two sharks will have a final bout as an exhibition and as motivation for our beginners. Maybe the top minnows can have a finals, too. As you can see, the tournament organizers can make things up as they go to try to get our kids the most fencing and best practice.\r\nWe have room for 30 total fencers.\r\n\r\nSEEDING\r\nWe will probably seed by classification then highest national rank then randomly in case you were wondering. Sort of weird because we will take your national rank (if you have one) regardless of age and gender group and combine it. But this is sort of what is done with the 50-59 year old group when the 49 year olds age out....\r\n\r\nPrizes will be awarded for first to third place.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens now.\r\nPreregistration closes on February 10, 2019","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":170354,"tournament_id":42899,"tournament":"MTFC Youth Foil Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Youth Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-YMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Youth","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-02-10T11:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":42652,"name":"BCAF-W - Y-12\/14 Mixed Foil - YOUTH CUP - #5","start_date":"2019-02-10","end_date":"","comments":"This is a Philadelphia Division event.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n \r\nCheck USA rating at:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nFencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted.

Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf?_ga=2.44686689.433513283.1547236097-1943416123.1546365588 \r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.
