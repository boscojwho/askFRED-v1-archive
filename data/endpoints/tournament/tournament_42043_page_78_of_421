There will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2009-2010 age requirements:\r\nYouth-8: born in 2001-2004\r\nYouth-10: born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-12: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-14: born in 1995-1998\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Youth Progressive #4 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8. Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in all events.\r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1. Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event. If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2. Events are mixed (boys and girls). Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender. (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3. Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments. Point standings will be posted at http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4. The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series. For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n\r\n$20.00 registration fee and $10.00 per event. There will be a $10.00 late fee if you register at the door.\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/25\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/23\/2009.","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950  SW Western Avenue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.4841092,"longitude":-122.7827255,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":40550,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40551,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40552,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40553,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40554,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40555,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40858,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40859,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":40860,"tournament_id":9295,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-09-26T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9301,"name":"AFC Fall Open","start_date":"2009-09-26","end_date":"2009-09-27","comments":"","prereg_open":"2009-08-26","prereg_close":"2009-09-25","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nOpen Mixed Epee Close of registration: Sunday 9:45am\r\nOpen Mixed Foil Close of registration: Saturday 1:30pm\r\nOpen Mixed Saber Close of registration: Sunday 1:00pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/26\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/25\/2009.\r\n\r\nRegistration $20\r\nEvent $10\r\n\r\n\r\nArizona Fencing Center\r\n535 W.

Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 1999-2002\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1997-2000\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14 Epee -- Born 1995 or later\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=9659\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/25\/2009\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.

Arrive early to get your equipment checked! We will be running on a strict schedule so your promptness is appreciated.\r\n\r\nDepending on the total number of entrants in the large events (mixed epee and foil), it is possible that we will need to only promote the top 80% to the DEs after the pools.  (This will probably only happen if an event exceeds roughly 75 entrants.)  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>--- Registration Information ---<\/b>\r\nRegistration is $20 plus $20 per event entered and must be pre-paid.\r\n\r\n<b>!!!

Pre-register on AskFRED like you normally would, but skip the payment screen.  This will add you to the list of registrants, but note that you have not yet paid.  You can pay later (before the deadline) by simply going through the registration process on AskFRED again.\r\n\r\nQ: I don't want to pre-pay until I'm certain I can attend.\r\nA: If you pre-pay and are unable to attend, we will give you a refund of your event fees.

Anything we can do we should do\r\nMichael D\u00e2\u0080\u0099Asaro, July 4, 2008\r\n1996 Olympic Team \r\n\r\n\r\nGiven the widespread and growing support for the Komen Foundation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work on breast cancer awareness and research funding, bringing the fencing community into the fight is not only laudable but inspired. Might oaks from small acorns grow, and this event is sure to generate interest and, ultimately, the tangible benefit of funds to contribute to the goal of eliminating breast cancer. As I remember my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final year dealing with the consequences of breast cancer, I am very pleased to see my other family, the fencing community, take up the cause. I wish the organizers, sponsors, and competitors all the best in this wonderful endeavor.\r\nPeter A.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Foil \r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/03\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41442,"tournament_id":9533,"tournament":"Div 2 Foil","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":37,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-10-04T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9052,"name":"Gore for the Gold","start_date":"2009-10-04","end_date":"","comments":"Come & fence in Gore for the Gold!
