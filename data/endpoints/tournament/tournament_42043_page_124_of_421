How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers.

Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":64283,"tournament_id":15038,"tournament":"Y12 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-14T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14527,"name":"Tiger D-Under Men's & Women's Foil and Epee","start_date":"2011-05-14","end_date":"","comments":"Fee:  With pre-registration:  $35 first event, $15 second event;  Without pre-registration at the door:  $45 first event, $25 second event\r\n\r\nTo pre-register via e-mail, or for more information about this meet, e-mail the host at:   elioult@hotmail.com","prereg_open":"2011-02-28","prereg_close":"2011-05-10","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":35,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Fee:  With pre-registration:  $35 first event, $15 second event;  Without pre-registration at the door:  $45 first event, $25 second event\r\n\r\nTo pre-register via e-mail, or for more information about this meet, e-mail the host at:   elioult@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nOrganizer: Tiger Fencing Club website: http:\/\/www.tigerfencingclub.com\r\nContact: Tim Yultchiev, Elmira Ioultchieva @ 412-334-4736 elioult@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nClose of check-in: \r\nFoil 9:30 AM\r\nEpee: 1:30 PM\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nWomen's Epee\r\nWomen's Foil\r\nMen's Epee\r\nMen's Foil\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nThomas Presbyterian Church \r\n1068 Linden Rd, \r\nEighty Four, PA 15330\r\nDirections on Mapquest.com (copy and paste http: address)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.mapquest.com\/maps?city=Eighty+Four&state=PA&address=1068+Linden+Rd&zipcode=15330-2529&country=US&latitude=40.236928&longitude=-80.095959&geocode=ADDRESS\r\n\r\n(This is very important please follow to 1068 Linden Rd, NOT Thomas Rd.

I want to remind you to please have your equipment ready to be tested (body cords unwrapped and untangled, mask available) prior to approaching the Armorer.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/28\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/10\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Thomas Presbyterian Church Christian Life Center","address":"1068 Linden Road","city":"84","state":"PA","zip":"15330","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2368549,"longitude":-80.0959981,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":32,"name":"Western Pennsylvania","abbrev":"WPA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":62525,"tournament_id":14527,"tournament":"Tiger D-Under Men's & Women's Foil and Epee","full_name":"Div3 Men's Foil","short_name":"Dv3MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-14T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":62526,"tournament_id":14527,"tournament":"Tiger D-Under Men's & Women's Foil and Epee","full_name":"Div3 Women's Foil","short_name":"Dv3WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-14T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":62527,"tournament_id":14527,"tournament":"Tiger D-Under Men's & Women's Foil and Epee","full_name":"Div3 Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv3WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-14T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":62528,"tournament_id":14527,"tournament":"Tiger D-Under Men's & Women's Foil and Epee","full_name":"Div3 Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv3ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-14T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14533,"name":"WS Panthers Epeeq","start_date":"2011-05-14","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2011-03-01","prereg_close":"2011-05-13","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Strath Haven Middle School","address":"200 South Providence Road","city":"Wallingford","state":"PA","zip":"19086","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":64559,"tournament_id":14533,"tournament":"WS Panthers Epeeq","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":64560,"tournament_id":14533,"tournament":"WS Panthers Epeeq","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15054,"name":"Jcps 2011 Fecncing Championship","start_date":"2011-05-14","end_date":"","comments":"Cost for the event is $20, participants should arrive 30min before event to sign in and get dressed.Students w\/ electric equipment should bring it.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":64284,"tournament_id":15039,"tournament":"Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-05-15T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14784,"name":"Video Replay Challenge 2.0","start_date":"2011-05-15","end_date":"","comments":"Welcome to the Video Replay Challenge 2.0.
