This year, there will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2007-2008 age requirements: \r\nYouth-8:  born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12: born in 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14: born in 1993-1996\r\n\r\n(Fencers who are on the USFA national point standings in one age bracket are also eligible to compete in the next higher age bracket.)\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.  The first series will end at Youth Progressive #4 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4; the second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8.  Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil, Youth-12 Foil, Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.  \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1.  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event.  If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2.  Events are mixed (boys and girls).  Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender.  (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3.  Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments.  Point standings will be posted at www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4.  The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series.  For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n------------------\r\nSchedule (close of registration times & award ceremony times):\r\n\r\n9:00am: Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n10:30am Y8 Foil\r\n12:30pm Awards ceremony for Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee & Y8 Foil\r\n\r\n1:00pm: Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil\r\n2:30: Y12 Epee\r\n5:00pm Awards ceremony for Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil & Y12 Epee\r\n-------------------\r\n\r\nCost: $10 preregistration fee ($15 at the door), plus $10 per event.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for fencers born in 2000 or earlier years, and can be purchased or renewed online or at the door.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/09\/2007.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/29\/2007.","venue":{"name":"NorthWest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Ave","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97007","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.484237,"longitude":-122.782503,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":20000,"tournament_id":4362,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-09-30T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20001,"tournament_id":4362,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-09-30T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20002,"tournament_id":4362,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-09-30T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20024,"tournament_id":4362,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-09-30T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20025,"tournament_id":4362,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-09-30T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20026,"tournament_id":4362,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":17,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-09-30T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4365,"name":"Atlantic Fencing Academy Youth 10-12 Foil and Sabe","start_date":"2007-09-30","end_date":"","comments":"Entrance to the fencing academy is from the north side of the building.","prereg_open":"2007-09-10","prereg_close":"2007-09-29","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":20,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Venue: Atlantic Fencing Academy, East Brunswick\r\n280 Route 18 N, East Brunswick, NJ 08816\r\n\r\nSchedule: All times are close of registration.

Free parking on street. Showers available.\r\n\r\nFAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in convertion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. I see two events listed, are they fenced as separate tournaments?\r\nA. No.  This is one combined event and is only separated out to allow everybody to register for the event.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nPre-registered fencers - if you are unable to attend, PLEASE delete your registration so that others can sign up. Email the organizer if you can't figure out how to do that.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958178,"longitude":-75.192624,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":19276,"tournament_id":4155,"tournament":"Philadelphia Novice (DRY) Cadet\/ Jr\/ Adult Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Pool results Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Pool results","close_of_reg":"2007-10-06T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":21094,"tournament_id":4155,"tournament":"Philadelphia Novice (DRY) Cadet\/ Jr\/ Adult Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Consolation round pool results Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Consolation round pool results","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":21095,"tournament_id":4155,"tournament":"Philadelphia Novice (DRY) Cadet\/ Jr\/ Adult Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Full results including consola Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Full results including consola","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4516,"name":"CDFS Open Sabre","start_date":"2007-10-06","end_date":"","comments":"Open to all all fencers age 13 and older, depending on number of entries, one or two rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.

Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred.
