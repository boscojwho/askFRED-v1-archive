The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Over 20 fencing programs are invited to register, the first 8 teams to register will have the opportunity to compete. \r\n\r\nUnlike many team events targeted at colleges this event allows teams to register by weapon squad rather than requiring that a full team of nine to twelve fencers across three weapons, or 18 to 24 fencers across the three weapons in two genders be fielded. For this event, a club might only register their foil squad, or register two teams from their foil squad and elect not to field sabre or epee. A club might field a men's sabre and a women's foil team, or a mixed epee team. The event is set up to allow freedom in team construction. \r\n\r\nTeams must represent one club or school and one coach. \r\n\r\nThe event will begin with individual rounds on Saturday which will be used to seed the team brackets for Sunday. Each team will field one person from their team as a representative in the individual competition. The Individual Championship will consist of a single pool of 8 fencers which will promote the top four fencers to an elimination bracket. The results of the individual championship will determine where teams are seeded in the team bracket. \r\n\r\nThe team event will utilize the NCAA format in which teams fence a series of 9 five-touch bouts. The school or club which wins 5 or more bouts wins. Matches will end once the match is decided (once a team wins 5 bouts). The winning team will continue into an upper bracket and the losing team will continue into a lower bracket. This will involve three rounds of matches to decide final placement of teams. \r\n\r\nTeams may consist of three or four people. Only the teams which are competing in that event may be in the venue, along with one coach. Minor teams may have a spectator per minor. Teams may register with a set of three or four fencers and may then update their specific fencers up until the day of the event.  \r\n\r\nThe cost will be $180 per team. If a club fields more than one team per weapon, or teams across multiple weapons they must pay for each team. Teams must pay together and may pay by paypal. The individual event is included in the cost of the team event, so there is not a separate fee. \r\n\r\nThe first 8 teams to register will reserve spots. Additional teams may request to be wait listed by emailing bj@twcfencing.com. Preregistered teams must pay by 3\/12\/2022 or risk losing their spot to a team on the wait list. \r\n\r\nPrizes (Based on a minimum of five teams participating)\r\nIndividual medals to the top 3 placements in the individual event\r\nIndividual medals to the team members of the top two teams\r\nTeam Trophy to the top three teams\r\n\r\nTeams must designate what club they represent and what coach they represent.\r\n\r\nMedal to the coach of the first place finishing team\r\nAward to the club with the most first place finishes\r\nAward to the club with the most top three placements\r\nAward to the coach with the most first place finishes\r\nAward to the coach with the most top three placements\r\n  \r\nInvited programs\r\nAcademies of Fencing in Baltimore - Salle Palasz\r\nAcademies of Fencing in Baltimore - TriWeapon Fencing Club\r\nUniversity of Maryland Baltimore County Fencing Team\r\nSaint John's College\r\nUS Naval Academy\r\nUniversity of Delaware\r\nSaint Mary's College of Maryland\r\nUniversity of Maryland College Park\r\nGeorge Washington University\r\nGeorgetown University\r\nGeorge Mason University\r\nJames Madison University\r\nTemple University\r\nBryn Mawr College\r\nDrexel University\r\nMillersville University\r\nSwathmore\r\nPenn State University Fencing Club\r\nWest Virginia University\r\nShippensburg University\r\nCarnegie Melon University \r\nChesapeake Fencing Club\r\nSt. Louis University Fencing Club\r\nSavage Fencing Club\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Palasz","address":"1120 N Rolling Rd","city":"Catonsville","state":"MD","zip":"21228","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.2863909,"longitude":-76.7529001,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194909,"tournament_id":50026,"tournament":"Black and Gold Invitational Team Championship","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-03-20T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194910,"tournament_id":50026,"tournament":"Black and Gold Invitational Team Championship","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-03-20T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194911,"tournament_id":50026,"tournament":"Black and Gold Invitational Team Championship","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Team Saber","short_name":"MxSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-03-20T17:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194912,"tournament_id":50026,"tournament":"Black and Gold Invitational Team Championship","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-03-19T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194913,"tournament_id":50026,"tournament":"Black and Gold Invitational Team Championship","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-03-19T18:15:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194914,"tournament_id":50026,"tournament":"Black and Gold Invitational Team Championship","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-03-19T18:15:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":49772,"name":"Shamrock Old Farts","start_date":"2022-03-19","end_date":"","comments":"This is a Veterans ONLY Event. $25 registration fee* plus $10 per weapon\r\nUSFA membership required.\r\n\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2022-01-13","prereg_close":"2022-03-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is a Veterans ONLY Event.
