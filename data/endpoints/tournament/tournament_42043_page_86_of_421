My poor head!<br>\r\nAre you ready for the the most fun-tastic epee event of the year?  Are you?  WAKE UP AND ANSWER ME!!!  NYAC's annual Hangover Epee event is on Friday, 01\/01\/10.  The event is mixed (or rather mixed-up) and all are welcome (drunkards and kiddies alike).  This event is produced and directed by George Masin, somebody who makes you feel like you have a hangover everytime you fence him.<br>\r\nRegistration Closes at 11:59PM ET the Wednesday before the event.<br>\r\n<i>ONLY $30 SMACKERS!<\/i><br>\r\nYou must complete online payment to be successfully registered for this event and avoid the $10 late-fee at the door.<br>\r\n<b>Prizes<\/b>\r\nAll prizes (which generally go through twenty something place) are liquid-based, and range from dog-of-the-hair to non-alcoholic.  The first fencer to finish all his\/her bouts gets a special prize.  Also, the winner of this prize will almost certainly be Alex Tsinis.<br>\r\n<b>Format<\/b>\r\nThe tournament uses the round-robin format.  In this format, each fencer has a bout with every other fencer and final placements are determined by overall records (there are no direct elimination bouts).  So there is lots of fencing and no quick exits from your hangover misery.   Please note: The event usually starts with bouts of somewhere between 3-5 touches (depending on the number of competitors).  As time wears on, bouts are shortened all the way down to one-touch.  Since everyone fences everyone else, no one is eliminated early.  Everyone who enters should be prepared to stay until the end of the awards ceremony which should end no later than 4pm.  If you have to be some place before then, don't enter the competition.<br>\r\n<b>Time &amp; Location<\/b>\r\nCheck-In and Late-Registration CLOSES promptly at 10am and the first bouts will begin around 10:15am.<br>The New York Athletic Club is located at 180 Central Park South, in Manhattan.<br>Please use the 58th Street Entrance at the NE corner of <a  href=\"maps.google.com\/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=58th+Street+and+7th+Avenue,+New+York,+NY&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=50.291089,82.089844&ie=UTF8&ll=40.7662,-73.97955&spn=0.005924,0.010021&z=17&om=1\" target=\"_blank\">58th St and 7th Ave<\/a>, under the green NYAC awning.<br>\r\n<b>Parking<\/b>\r\nSeveral garages in the area give discounts to NYAC guests, including most on 58th street both east and west of 7th avenue.\r\nMake sure to look for the NYAC winged foot sign at the garage entrance, and ask the NYAC desk guard to validate your ticket before you leave the club.\r\n<i>Note: This info is to help you... we do not guarantee any discounts whatsoever.<\/i>\r\nIf you are looking for free street parking, we recommend the Upper West Side between 63rd and 70th, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th St around 10th Ave.<br>\r\n<b>Entry<\/b>\r\nAll events require registration and pre-payment via AskFRED by the stated close of registration date.\r\nThere is an extra $10 fee for late or onsite registration\/payment (NO EXCUSES ACCEPTED - THIS MEANS YOU).<br>\r\n<b>NYAC Member Info<\/b>\r\nIf you are a card-carrying member of the NYAC, sign-up but DO NOT go through online payment.

The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.

Trophies are awarded based on fencer's top 3 three scores.\r\n\r\nAnnouncing a new Youth Progressive tournament program for 2009-2010\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for fencers born in 2001 or earlier years, and can be purchased or renewed at the door.\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments are back and better than\r\never! There will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2009-2010 age requirements:\r\nYouth-8: born in 2001-2004\r\nYouth-10: born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-12: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-14: born in 1995-1998\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Youth Progressive #4 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8. Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in all events.\r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1. Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event. If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2. Events are mixed (boys and girls). Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender. (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3. Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments. Point standings will be posted at http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4. The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series. For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 12\/17\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/31\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Avenue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":45452,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45453,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45454,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45455,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45456,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T12:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45457,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T12:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45458,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T11:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45459,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T12:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":45460,"tournament_id":10543,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10544,"name":"The BRFC Back to School Open","start_date":"2010-01-09","end_date":"","comments":"Proof of USFA membership required and USFA rules apply.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY14 Mixed Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/08\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41582,"tournament_id":9574,"tournament":"Y14 Sabre","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-09T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10346,"name":"Tennessee Division JO Qualifiers","start_date":"2010-01-09","end_date":"","comments":"Qualifiers for this year's Junior Olympics to be held in Memphis, TN on February 12-15, 2010.\r\n\r\nVisitor parking will be located in Lots 74 & 75.","prereg_open":"2009-11-21","prereg_close":"2010-01-03","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"The most accurate directions to the Vanderbilt Student Rec Center can be found by entering the following coordinates into Google Maps: \r\n\r\n+36\u00c2\u00b0 8' 27.61\", -86\u00c2\u00b0 48' 27.31\" (36.141003, -86.807587)\r\n\r\n*** Traffic and Weather Notice ***\r\nThe highway between Chattanooga and Nashville has be driven by a member of the TN division on Friday (1\/8) afternoon to test the state of the road over Monteagle Mountain.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Epee\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/09\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41583,"tournament_id":9575,"tournament":"Div. 3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":17,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-01-10T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10113,"name":"New York Grand Prix Series Women's Epee #4","start_date":"2010-01-10","end_date":"","comments":"After last season's big success, again in 2009-10 season: Best epee tournament in New York City with highly ranked and international fencers.
