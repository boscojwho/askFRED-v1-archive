Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87626,"tournament_id":21422,"tournament":"FAP Div3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-24T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21432,"name":"Cobra JUNIOR - All weapons","start_date":"2013-03-24","end_date":"","comments":"Junior (born 1993-1999, or on Cadet points list)...

No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names are NOT required on fencer uniforms.\r\n \r\nThe electric mask bib is required for ALL foil events.  Masks with the electric bib MAY NOT be used in epee events because the bib can prevent the opponent's weapon from scoring.\r\n\r\nFor Youth-10 events, a 30\u0094 or 32\u0094 blade is required.  For Youth-12 and Youth-14 events, a standard 30\u0094-35\u0094 blade is permitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Age Eligibility ----------\r\n\r\nEligibility is based on birth year, regardless of the specific day\/month:\r\n\r\nYouth-10:  Born in 2002 through 2005\r\nYouth-12:  Born in 2000 through 2003\r\nYouth 14:  Born in 1998 through 2001\r\n \r\nFencers with Youth-10 national points are eligible to fence in the Youth-12 events.\r\nFencers with Youth-12 national points are eligible to fence in the Youth-14 events.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Event Seeding ----------\r\n\r\nFencer classifications, club and division affiliations, and national point rankings will be validated against the USFA's membership database as of April 4, 2013.  It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that the USFA has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to that date.  No classification or affiliation changes will be made at the event.\r\n\r\nIn all events, all ranked fencers (those possessing national points) will be seeded ahead of unranked fencers, regardless of classification.  All unranked fencers will be seeded by classification letter and year.\r\n\r\nInitial seedings will be posted online approximately one week prior to the event.  \r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Equipment Check ----------\r\n\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks.

This series will help students gain valuable tournament experience and prepare them for bigger events. \r\n\r\nNO RATINGS CAN BE AWARDED AT UNSANCTIONED EVENTS.

This series emphasizes sportsmanship and friendly competition for newer fencers!\r\n\r\nThe top 4 places will be awarded with medals.\r\n\r\nThis non-USFA tournament will be governed by USFA rules.
