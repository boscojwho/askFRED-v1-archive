If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.

A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify!

Join us for two days of team competition! Open, D & Under, and Kids team foil, plus Open team epee. \r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: 2015 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney\r\nDate(s): 03\/21\/2015 - 03\/22\/2015\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nSaturday, March 21st:\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10\/Y12 Team Foil\r\n10:30 AM - Open Team Foil\r\n\r\nSunday, March 22nd:\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - D & Under Team Foil\r\n10:30 AM - Open Team Epee\r\n\r\nAll times listed are close of registration.\r\n\r\nDepending on the number of teams in each event, the event format will either be round robin, or pools of 3-4 teams with direct elimination for the medal round. Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nThe Y10\/Y12 event is for fencers born in 2002 or later. All other events are for fencers born in 2001 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. The Div III event is for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2014-2015) competitive members of the USFA or CFF. All fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $45 per team (including sales tax). There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=29088\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/20\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $50.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made.

Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b><i>Eligibility Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be <b>current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.<\/b> To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nFencers competing in Div 2\/3 events must follow the rating restrictions set forth by the USFA. Only fencers with a rating of C or lower are eligible to fence at these qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies <b>prior<\/b> to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Uniform Requirements:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nCONDUCTIVE FOIL BIBS ARE REQUIRED THIS SEASON. As of August 1st, 2012, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the conductive foil bib.\r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Venue Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

NJFA has helped enrich the lives of hundreds of young children and their families. Along the way our students have experienced exceptional success both athletically and academically.  NJFA is proud to have assisted so many students to earn scholarships for colleges including Division I programs not to mention the hundreds of students that have utilized the NJFA network to assist in college acceptance and employment.\r\n\r\nEVENT\r\n\r\nThe Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) is sanctioned by USA Fencing and their Youth Development Committee (YDC). RYCs are a group of events in each region throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y10, Y12, and Y14 age categories in all three weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn regional points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families.The Y8 events listed are additional approved events and not part of the RYC.\r\n \r\nRYC\u0092s are one of the possible qualification paths for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\n\r\nThe USFA has made significant changes with respect to eligibility and qualification paths.  \r\nWe are providing the following information \/ schedule, for your convenience.  \r\n\r\nBeginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at the Summer Nationals will be National Championships. \r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) has been instituted to recognize participation and accomplishments of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. \r\nYouth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. The USFA has approved an abundance of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, only their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. \r\nFor more details please visit http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/5402\/2014-2015_Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative.pdf\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete.

The electric foil bib is required. Women must wear breast protectors. In epee and foil, a full jacket is required (i.e., a jacket with croissard \/ groin strap). Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing uniforms or gloves must not have any rips, tears, holes, etc. USA Fencing allows uniforms of a single pastel color or designs on the rear (unarmed) arm and leg.

Items passing inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\n\r\nAll events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary inspection will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE to ensure the presence of the following equipment: underarm plastron, weapons, body cords and all appropriate weapons check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met. \r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other required equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules. \r\n\r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords. Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition. \r\n\r\nNote that Blue Gauntlet Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance RYC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on Wednesday, March 21, 2015. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until the complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Friday or Saturday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Saturday or Sunday of this tournament.\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible in accordance with SYC guidelines with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau.

fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\nFencing Equipment:\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\nWaivers:\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All Saints Elementary School

You MUST be a USFA or FIE member. Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx). If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Friday before the Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in. Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in. Please bring your USFA card or proof of membership or be prepared to join at the competition. There will be no exceptions to this rule. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up for more than one event and they happen to actually be scheduled to fence then be prepared to fence both events at the same time if they overlap. If you are called to the strip and you do not arrive by the third call you will be scratched and there is no refund.\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA qualifying event so all fencing gear must conform to all USFA rules and regulations. Including the name on your leg or back and no holes in your uniform, mask, pants, and gloves. Under arm protectors are required by all and chest protectors also for all women.\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095 You absolutely, positively must be a Nevada division member in order to compete in qualifying events. \r\n\u0095 You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing). \r\n\r\nIf you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete. Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter. Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Nevada division's qualifiers. If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (director@redrockfencingcenter.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\nIf you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (702-222-1901). \r\n\r\n<b>Registration fee<b>  $20.00 \r\n<b>Event fee<b> $20.00 per event \r\nif done before the day of the event. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE:<b> Registration\/Registering at the door for this qualifier is $40 Registration fee + $40 per event. Please bring check or exact change. No charge cards accepted.\r\n\r\n<b>Entry<b>\r\n\r\nAll events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event. Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Pacific Time) on the Saturday before the Sunday events. \r\n\r\nNo refunds! If you need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail by 03\/20\/15 to receive credit towards a future event. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Format<b>\r\nOne round of pools with 100% promotion to Direct Elimination.\r\n\r\n<b>Check-in<b>\r\nBegins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event. \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in. If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in. Events generally start fencing about 10-20 minutes after close of registration. First events of the day may start sooner.\r\n\r\nEvents that will be fenced:\r\nWe have no control over or if any events will be fenced. We are required to fence any event that has 4 or more people in it. We have listed the events that have a potential of being fenced but if three (3) or fewer show up then we will not fence the event. If you are coming in from out of town and your event is listed as having a close of time for the event then you should plan for it. If you do not show and others show up to fence it then you will not be put down as having fenced the event. You must physically show up at the event to cement your \"right\" to be put down as being qualified from the Division. Simply paying for the event and not showing up does not guarantee you to being qualified for that event unless there is a total of three or less who has signed up for the event at close of registration. If there are two fencers from out of town registered for an event and two fencers from in town registered as well at the close of registration but the two out of town fencers do not show at the close of registration time then the two locals will fence for two of the spots and the two out of town fencers will fence a fence-off at their club for the third spot. \r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Red Rock Fencing Center","address":"8352 W.

All USFA Foil Events require mask with conductive bibs and mask cords.\r\n\r\nYouth Development Practice Tournaments: DESF will begin a new format for practice tournaments for youth. This format is designed to assist youth to have a fuller learning experience at fencing tournaments and to address youth events that have had historically low turnouts. The format involves fencers as volunteer mentors to assist in creating bouting opportunities for youth with the goal of developing a stronger local field of youth fencers. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nNovice DESF Practice Tournaments: Novice Events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability. These events are sponsored by DESF as practice tournaments for new fencers and are not Northeast Division sanctioned USFA events. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nPre-registration & Entry Fees:\r\nUSFA sanctioned events:\r\nEntry fees: $20 per event at the door. $15 per event if you pre-register on Ask-FRED by Saturday, 3\/21\/15. These fees only apply to DESF hosted tournaments. Pre-registration closes Saturday, 3\/21\/15 at 9:00 PM.\r\n\r\nYouth Development, Novice and practice events: $10 per event per person. If you are a designated volunteer mentor for the youth development events, it is free to participate.\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to volunteer.\r\n\r\nCourtesy of pre-registration is highly encouraged, but those wishing to register at the door are welcome. All volunteer donations to the referee fund are welcome and highly appreciated to help pay or discount the entry fees of those who volunteer to referee. When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USFA Events will be awarded according to USFA tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase. Pizza will be brought in for lunch at $2\/slice.\r\n\r\nOther helpful info:\r\n\r\n\u0095 309 traffic can be busy so leave enough travel time. \r\n\u0095 Phone number is (215) 716-3777.
