There are no national points awarded at RJCC competitions; please refer to Chapter 3 for more information on the Regional Point structure. The Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is a ranking program designed to recognize and reward both participation and accomplishment at the RJCC Tournament level.\r\n\r\nRegional Point Standings for Youth, Cadet and Junior reflect an athlete\u0092s results at RYC and\/or RJCC tournaments within their home region (based on division affiliation). These point standings are posted online and are updated within five business days after the tournament organizer has properly submitted results, event officials form, membership forms and paid the program service fee. \r\n\r\nFencers only earn points at RJCCs within their home region (region is assigned based on division affiliation). The best 2 results count towards the point total. These points may qualify Cadet and Junior fencers to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and July Challenge. \r\n\r\nNOTE:  As the event is being held after the January 10th deadline, these results DO NOT count towards qualification for the 2018 Junior Olympics in February 2018, BUT DO count towards qualification for the 2019 Junior Olympics in February of 2019.\r\n\r\nPoints earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of National Point Standings, for seeding or team selection purposes; they are only reflected in Regional Point Standings. Using the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants: ((#entries \u0096 place +1) \/ # entries) x 100 points The winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of the region. Regional RJCC points are only\r\nearned in the fencers own region.\r\n\r\nThe Cadet Regional Tournament is offered as part of the Regional Junior Cadet Circuit (RJCC). No national points are awarded; regional points are awarded to any competitor competing in their home region.

Fencers must have current USFA competitive membership and all required protective equipment including 800N saber glove.\r\n\r\n***Age categories***\r\n-Senior events: for fencers born 2004 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n***Registration fees***\r\n$35 for 1 event \r\n$55 for 2 events \r\n$10 EXTRA FOR THOSE WHO REGISTER AT THE DOOR.\r\n\r\nSpecial for college fencers from recognized collegiate teams: $25 first event if paid in advance: contact Bout Committee to get the discount. \r\n\r\n***Tournament Location***\r\n\r\nLiberty Fencing Club is located at 366 Easton Road, Warrington, PA 18976, between County Line Road and Street Road (on Route 611 across the street from Target & Lowe's). Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597 or Bout Committee at 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\n***Payment information***\r\n\r\nREVISED NO-SHOW POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nC & Under Senior Mixed Saber\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/12\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/30\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.244807,"longitude":-75.142587,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":150551,"tournament_id":37905,"tournament":"Liberty FC Open and Div2 Sabre","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-28T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150552,"tournament_id":37905,"tournament":"Liberty FC Open and Div2 Sabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-28T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":37910,"name":"Bay Cup at HALB: JWS2, WS3, XS3, VXS3","start_date":"2018-01-28","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2017-08-20","prereg_close":"2018-01-26","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"This is a Bay Cup tournament.

foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\nFencing Equipment:\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or

If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 1\/24\/18.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (maufrich@hotmail.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (maufrich@hotmail.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7663036,"longitude":-73.9792973,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151320,"tournament_id":38100,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #3 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":17,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-28T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":39383,"name":"Western New York Circuit (run by RFC and RIT)","start_date":"2018-01-28","end_date":"","comments":"This tournament is part of a series of senior\/open competitions for Western NY foil, sabre, and epee fencers.

These points may qualify D1A, DV2, and Veteran ROC fencers to the USA Fencing National Championships in D1A, DV2, DV3, and Veteran. The ROC point standings are not used for seeding National level tournaments.

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of three separate tournaments spread throughout the season (we decided to change from 4 tournaments), each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on the size of the tournament and where they finish, with the Grand Finale Tournament providing \"bonus\" points to competitors. \r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\nIn our first two seasons, our Grand Prizes have been brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event, along with guitar strap, stand and wall mount.\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed EpeeSenior Mixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/24\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/02\/2018.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695342,"longitude":-86.6757895,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":148465,"tournament_id":37452,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":38,"prereg_count":51,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-03T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":148466,"tournament_id":37452,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":20,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-04T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":153762,"tournament_id":37452,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":25,"prereg_count":28,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-03T15:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":153763,"tournament_id":37452,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-04T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":39763,"name":" Golden Foil Series #3 \/ Saber Series #1 pt. 2","start_date":"2018-02-03","end_date":"","comments":"Part 2 of the Golden Foil Series #3 \/ Saber Series #1  ","prereg_open":"","prereg_close":"","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Anchorage Fencing Club","address":"","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","zip":"99505","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Anchorage","latitude":61.3008086,"longitude":-149.7106353,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":13,"name":"Alaska","abbrev":"AK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":158317,"tournament_id":39763,"tournament":" Golden Foil Series #3 \/ Saber Series #1 pt. 2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39523,"name":"Let's Fence: E& U Foil, Y10F\/E, Y12\/14F.

No paper upgrades will be done on site and no computer will be available for online upgrades on site. \r\n\r\nDate of Birth must be verified on the current valid membership card or proof (passport, state-issue ID, birth certificate, etc.) must be provided. No exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe list of registrants who have not checked in will be called aloud 5 minutes before the close of registration along with a \"5 minutes to close\" announcement. When the close of registration is called, the event will start. There will be no delay for late registrants. Similarly, there will be an announcement when all pools are in for each event; the fencers will have 5 minutes to address with BC any incorrect information they find. As soon as the 5 minutes have elapsed or all issues have been addressed, whichever comes second, the DE's will start.\r\n\r\nDue to the higher than expected registrations and limited number of strips, the 3-call rule will be in effect (3rd call to strip means a no-show). For fencers in multiple events this means bouts will be delayed if there are other bouts that can reasonably be fenced without delaying the event or tournament, but the bouts will not be delayed if it will delay the event or tournament overall. Bouts, delayed or not, will not be announced in any special way; it is up to the fencers to pay attention and listen for their name being called. Events will be assigned to particular strips and this information will be posted so as to minimize the chances of missing a call to strip.\r\n\r\nThere will only be a 5 minute window to check pool scores for accuracy once all of them are in. Each fencer should check 1 row and 1 column on their pool sheet (their points scored and their points received) before signing on the right side of the page. There will not be any space for the V\/TS\/TR\/Ind\/Pl boxes on the pool sheet. If there are any issues that need to be addressed once all the pools are in, it is up to the fencer to bring him or herself and the opponent against which they feel the score was incorrectly recorded to the BC. There are plenty of phone apps that can help with score recording\/memory if a fencer doesn't yet trust their own ability to remember the scores for all their bouts; a fencing journal, scrap paper, or blank pool sheet printed from home could all be useful, also.  \r\n\r\nReferees will return pool sheets to the BC, but fencers will return their own DE slips (not parents, coaches, or referees). The fencer returning the slip will be asked to confirm their name and the bout's total score. This is the last chance to catch any errors. Once the slip is entered into the computer, the score is final and will not be changed unless the operator entered it into the computer differently from the slip. This means if Fencer A confirms a slip that says Fencer B won 15-4 when the score was supposed to be Fencer A won 15-4, then Fencer B is the one who competes in the next bout and not Fencer A. \r\n\r\nFor Armory check-in:\r\n \r\nDO NOT BRING EQUIPMENT BAGS TO THE CONTROL TABLE, only bring the following:\r\n \r\nMask\r\nMask cords: remove old inspection marks\r\nBody Cords: untangled and separated with old inspection marks removed\r\nLames: zipped up and right side out, no hangers\r\nGloves\r\nWeapons are checked on the strip\r\n\r\nArmory check-in is open on Friday 5-8pm for those who are already in town to compete early Saturday morning.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, the organizers would like you to be aware of the following: due to the higher than expected participants expect limited strips and tight space.

In order to fence in the GLHSFC Championships, a fencer needs to be a student at a GLHSFC high school, have competed in three Conference Meets during the season. If a fencer attends a school with a GLHSFC team, they may only represent their school team.\r\n\r\nB. The initial seeding of fencers at GLHSFC Championships is figured by averaging an individual fencer's two best finishes from the season. Fencers without three finishes from the season may not compete in the Championships. In all cases, fencers will be seeded by this formula. USFA ratings only apply as tie-breakers for students with the same GLHSFC seeding.\r\n\r\nC. Each high school team or club may enter up to four fencers in each weapon category (Mens' Foil, Womens' Foil, Mens' Epee, Womens' Epee, Mens' Sabre, Womens' Sabre).\r\n\r\nD. Conference Championships will be awarded in each weapon category (see above), and in Overall Mens' Team and Overall Womens' Team. Individuals finishing in the top eight of each competition will be recognized with trophies or medals, and will be considered All-Conference athletes.\r\n\r\nE. Team championships are calculated by adding the final placements of all fencers in the Conference Championship meet. The team with the lowest score wins. When teams enter less than four fencers in an event, they receive a score equivalent to the lowest finisher plus one for each missing fencer.\r\n\r\nPre-Registration Closes on 2\/1\/2018.","venue":{"name":"University of Chicago Laboratory Schools Gymnasium","address":"1362 East 59th Street","city":"Chicago","state":"IL","zip":"60637","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":41.7880278,"longitude":-87.5939404,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":157977,"tournament_id":39677,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":54,"prereg_count":57,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":157978,"tournament_id":39677,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Women's Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":44,"prereg_count":47,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":157979,"tournament_id":39677,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":52,"prereg_count":52,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":157980,"tournament_id":39677,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":44,"prereg_count":46,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":157981,"tournament_id":39677,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Men's Saber","short_name":"MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":56,"prereg_count":59,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":157982,"tournament_id":39677,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Women's Saber","short_name":"WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":34,"prereg_count":36,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39443,"name":"Winter Y8 & Y12 FCMC Youth Saber Scrimmage","start_date":"2018-02-04","end_date":"","comments":"This is a scrimmage and will be organized to provide more fencing than a typical tournament with everyone guaranteed at least 2 DE bouts.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
