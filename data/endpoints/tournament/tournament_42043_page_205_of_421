If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2013-2014 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-Lambertville Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list using the link in your confirmation email. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n$50 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 2\/12\/14. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n$70 at the door for late registrations (after 2\/12\/14) and walk-ins (cash or check only).  \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\n***Cash & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE:  9:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94085,"tournament_id":23358,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-02-22T16:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":25669,"name":"Silas Beatdown Unrated Epee","start_date":"2014-02-22","end_date":"","comments":"Unrated Epee\r\nCompetitive USFA membership required\r\nEntry fee $10","prereg_open":"2014-02-17","prereg_close":"2014-02-21","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Spokane Fencers Unlimited","address":"2710 N Madelia","city":"Spokane","state":"WA","zip":"99207","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.682812,"longitude":-117.385777,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":2,"name":"Inland Empire","abbrev":"IE","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":102668,"tournament_id":25669,"tournament":"Silas Beatdown Unrated Epee","full_name":"Unrated Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-02-22T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24391,"name":"SAS February Saber: Y10, Y12, Y14 & Open","start_date":"2014-02-22","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2013-09-29","prereg_close":"2014-02-22","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nY14 Mixed Saber - 10:30am\r\nY10 Mixed Saber - 10:30am\r\nY12 Mixed Saber - 12pm\r\nSenior Mixed Saber - 1pm\r\n\r\nRegistration is open to all USFA members, and if you're not a member you can join at the tournament.\r\n\r\nRegistration fee is $10 + $5 per event fenced.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/29\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/22\/2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"760 Harrison St","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","zip":"98109","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6222207,"longitude":-122.3416157,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":97613,"tournament_id":24391,"tournament":"SAS February Saber: Y10, Y12, Y14 & Open","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":21,"prereg_count":23,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-02-22T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":97614,"tournament_id":24391,"tournament":"SAS February Saber: Y10, Y12, Y14 & Open","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-02-22T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":97615,"tournament_id":24391,"tournament":"SAS February Saber: Y10, Y12, Y14 & Open","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":14,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-02-22T12:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":97616,"tournament_id":24391,"tournament":"SAS February Saber: Y10, Y12, Y14 & Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":30,"prereg_count":35,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-02-22T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":25420,"name":"Div 3 & Unrated Duel","start_date":"2014-02-22","end_date":"2014-02-23","comments":" $25 registration fee, $10 event fee.
