Fencers from other clubs may enter the tournament, but please be aware this is an informal unsanctioned educational event.\r\n\r\nWe will be learning how to fence at a real tournament in a friendly, open environment where questions are welcome and the object is to have fun while learning about competition. Fencers will register as individuals and teams will be formed on the day of the event.

Pools for Cadet events will start, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. *Please note that Women's epee is the one exception, during which Junior events will come first, followed by Cadet events!*\r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 20 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility\r\nTo fence in JUNIOR events, fencer birth year must be between 1998-2004.\r\nTo fence in CADET events, fencer birth year must be between 2001-2004.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies BEFORE the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778. They can be contacted at 631-821-1131 for directions or assistance. A map can be found at http:\/\/bit.ly\/mfcmap Mission is in the same shopping center as Kohl\u0092s, Michael\u0092s, and PETCO.

There may also be equipment available for rent, subject to availability. Please call the club for more information.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nPlease note that event times listed are the close of registration. Fencers are required to be checked in by this time. Fencing will begin shortly after registration closes, usually within 30 minutes. It is recommended to leave yourself ample time for travel, check-in, and equipment check prior to the close of registration of your events. \r\n\r\nPlease note that there will be a Division Meeting held at the conclusion of the day's events!\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/28\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/01\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Mission Fencing Center","address":"346 Route

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $40 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n  \r\nThe conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\nIn order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\nThe conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/27\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/15\/2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Wasatch Fencing","address":"353 Market Street","city":"Kaysville","state":"UT","zip":"84037","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":41.0408311,"longitude":-111.9501338,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":12,"name":"Utah-Southern Idaho","abbrev":"UT-SID","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151123,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-17T08:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151127,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-16T08:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151129,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-17T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151130,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y12 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y12WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-16T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151133,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y12 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y12MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-16T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151135,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-15T17:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151136,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-16T15:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151138,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-15T17:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151139,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-16T15:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151140,"tournament_id":38019,"tournament":"Schoolhouse Fencing RYC - Region IV","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-16T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":38294,"name":"Freehold Fencing's Div II Foil","start_date":"2017-12-15","end_date":"","comments":"Div II Mixed Foil starts at 6:00 pm.

Barb started fencing at Morris Hills High School (NJ) and continued as a college club fencer at Purdue University. She served as the NJ division chair for over 10 years, coached Morris Hills High school for 21 years, served as USFA bout committee chair for many, many national fencing tournaments and Junior Olympic Championships, served as USFA Vice President from 2000-2004, and was honored with a lifetime membership to the USFA. This RYC honors her work on behalf of young fencers.\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nTournament information communications: Important tournament information will be communicated through the FRED e-mail system. Be sure your e-mail address is up-to-date. Visit askfred.net then go to \"My FRED\" to verify your current e-mail address. \r\n\r\nFollow live results at: http:\/\/www.escrimeresults.com\/cobra\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe RYC (Regional Youth Circuit) tournaments are held throughout the season, similar to the Super Youth Circuit tournaments. There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth-10 and Youth-12 events at either a NAC or SN and Youth-14 at SN. RYC tournaments are open to current USA Fencing competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE license.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10\/12\/14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament requirements.\r\n\r\nSummer National Championships: Beginning this season, the Y10 and Y12 events at Summer Nationals will be designated as National Championship Events. Qualification paths for Y10\/12\/14 are maintained in the Athletes Handbook (http:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/athlete-handbook).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 winner of an RYC event NO LONGER earns automatic qualification to the Summer National Championships.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRegional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be awarded for RYC events. End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region. Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS. Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region's Point List. Each participant gets Region 3 points at this RYC. The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count towards an athlete's final Regional Youth Ranking. RYC tournaments will award points to all participants. Allocations depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS nor the event seeding. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION AND EVENT FEES \r\nIf you wish to just make a donation but are not planning to fence, after entering and making your payment please remove your entry (or notify us).

Athletes without proof of membership must fill out all appropriate forms to pay for membership. Payment will be returned if membership can be verified.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing is working towards an age verification process. An athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via email, mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the database. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and temporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nParents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to:\u00a0information@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\n\r\nYou will not be allowed to fence, no matter what events you participated in last season, without proof of USFA competitive membership and age verification.\r\n\r\nBirth Year Eligibility 2017-2018 season:\r\nY10 2007-2010\r\nY12 2005-2008 (or on Y10 NRPS list)\r\nY14 2003-2006 (or on Y12 NRPS list)\r\nCadet (U17) 2001-2004 (or on Y14 NRPS list)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nSpecial Notes about Birth Year vs National Points List to determine Eligibility:\r\nThe Austin Challenge uses birth year eligibility for the 2017-2018 season. Age eligibility for events is determined by BIRTH YEAR, not age at time of participation.\r\n\r\nIf you are not eligible by BIRTH YEAR, but have NATIONAL POINTS for the age group younger than the event you want to enter, you are eligible to fence in that age group.\r\n\r\nAt this time, AskFred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible. If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please register for an additional event in a different category that you ARE age eligible to participate in, and then email the organizers with the name of the athlete, and the events that need to be switched around. Please verify your eligibility via NRPS BEFORE doing this! No refunds will be given for ineligible fencers who mistakenly enter. Please help us to process all of the registrations efficiently by paying for the different event before emailing the organizers.\r\n\r\nAwards will be given to the top eight finishers in each event\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistration for ALL events opens 1 hour prior to posted close time.\r\n\r\nThe armory will be open for equipment inspection starting at 7:30 pm at the Round Rock Sports Center on Friday, December 15.

Fencers that earn qualification at the Junior events will automatically qualify for the corresponding Cadet event (if age-eligible.)\r\n\r\nRegistration fees are non-refundable, but the per-event fees will not be charged if an event is not fenced.\r\n\r\nYou may join or renew your membership at the door, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership. If you join\/renew online, please bring a copy of your membership receipt as proof of membership. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. \r\n\r\nEach fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body cords. Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event, as all equipment must pass inspection in order to fence. Weapons are checked on the strip. Foil events use a conductive mask.\r\n\r\nThe USFA Board of Directors has adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Feel free to contact any of the Division Officers if you have questions.\r\n\r\nCome support our kids, families, and sport and eat with us!

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED DIV III FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18).

Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.
