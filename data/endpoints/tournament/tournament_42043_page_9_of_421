You are officially invited to the very first ever Yonas Sadek Island Cup, which will be held in Victoria at St. Andrew's High School on the 29th of October. \r\n\r\nWe figure that this province needs more fall tournaments.  Actually, it needs fall tournaments, period.  Plus the Saskatoon CSC event is rapidly approaching, and it seems to us that maybe doing something by way of a warm-up event would be a good idea.  However, the real reason we decided to get off our lazy bums do something about it is a guy called Yonas.  Although he isn't widely known outside of this city, Yonas Sadek is something of a legend at CCFC for all the time and effort he has given to this club, and as he is retiring this fall from coaching, we thought it was only right to name a tournament after him. \r\n\r\nYonas is far too serious for us to name something after him and then have it be full of kazoos and 'flepee' and silly things like that, but we really aren't any good at just running 'normal' tournaments, so instead, we're using a strange format, and it looks like this: \r\n<b>Stage One!<\/b>  We hold pools.  The pools are just normal pools, like at any other competition.  These are the ONLY pools we will hold. \r\n<b>Stage Two!<\/b>  A tableau.  Based on the results of the pools.  It's still normal. \r\n<b>Stage Three!<\/b>  It starts to get weird, so pay attention.  IF there are eight or more people registered who have BC recreational passports, there will also be a tableau for ONLY these fencers, and it will be based on the results of the first set of pools. \r\n<b>Stage Four!<\/b>  IF there are eight or more registrants of CFF passports, then there will be a tableau just for them based on the results of the first set of pools. \r\nBasically, if you get kicked out in the first round of DE's, suprise!  You're not done!  And you don't even have to understand a repechage system (which is convenient because neither do I).\r\n\r\n<b>Due to actual interest, we have decided to hold a sabre event!  However, I can't run this as an event unless I have at least 8 registrants.<\/b>  If you don't have any electric sabre gear but you wanna fence it anyway, sign up and we'll figure something out.  If you have extra electric gear that you can lend out on the usual you-break-it-you-pay-for-it policy, please please please email me because I can make it worth your while.\r\n\r\nThe competition will be held at <b>St. Andrew's High School, at 880 McKenzie Avenue.<\/b> This is the same venue as we used for Fence-a-thon and this year's Escrime Sundae.   Directions are available at http:\/\/members.shaw.ca\/ubik\/CapitalCity\/fenceathon_directions.htm.  Just ignore all the links to Fence-a-thon stuff.  <b>Epee registration closes at 10:00 AM, foil registration closes at 11:00 AM, and sabre registration (if it happens) closes at 12:00 noon<\/b>, unless you are attacked by ravenous bears en route, in which case I'll make an exception. <b>Entrance fees for every event will be $20.<\/b> You can register here, through AskFred.net.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in coming but don't have a (free) place to stay, we are offering billeting.  As it stands, space is limited, but that's never stopped us from finding a place for everyone before, so feel free to ask.  You are all also invited to stop by at the club on Friday night for freeeee fencing there, too.  If you take the ferry over as a foot passenger (which is a good idea because it makes it cheap), we can help you get into town. \r\n\r\nWe will not be testing masks or lames or bodycords, so you can all breathe a sigh of relief.  We will, however, be doing our darndest to test your blades, so you should practice stretching your springs to just barely pass.  This will prepare you for Saskatoon where people may say \"Congratulations! It's a mask!\" but then also \"There are only 14 centimetres of tape on this blade\". \r\n\r\n\r\nTo recap! 1. Yonas Sadek is awesome. 2. You have to come. 3. You can even stay in my basement. 4. Register now on AskFred.net (ie here) and I won't have to chase you. 5. The format is weird, but in an awesome kind of way. 6. It's on October 29 at St. Andrew's gym. Be there on time, or I may have to hurt you.   7. If you are interested in a sabre event, please please please register.  Waiting until the last minute is a stupid idea because then I won't know there's enough interest and I won't be able to hold it and you will be sorry.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to be in Victoria on Saturday morning (ie if you live here or you're coming on Friday night), I would LOVE help in setting up the gym, so please email me. Also email me if you have room in your basement for a fencer or two for friday night, as my house only has so much room.\r\n\r\nIf you go to one tournament this year, make it Fence-a-thon, but if you go to two tournaments this year, make the other one the Yonas Sadek Island Cup.  It'll be a blast, I swear.  If you have any questions, or you want to help, feel free to call me at (250) 592-8713 or email me at this address, thecatsaysquack@hotmail.com.  If you want to complain, keep it to yourself and make sure I never find out. \r\n\r\nSee you all there! \r\n   Sarah Smith, CCFC. \r\n","venue":{"name":"Victoria,
