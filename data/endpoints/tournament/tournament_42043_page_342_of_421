We have rearranged the daily schedule so that Y14 fencers can attend both the Y14 Qualifier events as well as the Y14 RYC in Portland.\r\n\r\nThis event is the qualifier for the Division II, Division III, and Youth-14 events at Summer Nationals in July.  All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they are pre-qualified as described below.)\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  All fencers must be US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule by Weapon -----\r\n\r\nMen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 1:00 pm Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 1:00pm  Saturday\r\n\r\nMen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 1:00pm  Saturday\r\n\r\nMen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Sunday\r\n\r\nWomen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 12 noon Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 10:00am Sunday\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nEntry deadline is 11:59pm on Wednesday, March 27th.  Late entries (at the door) will be charged DOUBLE.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $20 per event entered and must be paid in cash or by credit card at the door.  Entry fees will be collected for all events, even if they are not fenced.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to register and pay online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=41807\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nAll events will be run as a single round of pools with 100% promoted to the direct elimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division. \r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 2005 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 2004-2007\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14. If you finished in the top 40% at a Div II ROC like Bladefest or the Battle in Seattle, you have earned Div II or Div IA Regional Points and will be qualified for Div II\/III. If you finished in the top 40% of a Div II NAC, then you are also qualified.\r\n\r\nY14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event. Y14 fencers are also qualified if they have at least 150 Y14 regional points.\r\n\r\nYou can lookup regional points on the USFA website here:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/regionalPointsList\r\n- Select \"Regional Points List 2018-2019\"\r\n- Choose the weapon and point list (DV2M = Div II men, Y14W = Y14 Women, etc.)\r\n- We are in Region 1\r\n- Click \"Allez!\"\r\n\r\nFencer with Div II Regional Points are NOT skipped when calculating the qualifiers at this event.  This means that if you have regional points (and are therefore already qualified) but fence and finish in the top 25%, you will \"take up\" a qualification slot that could otherwise go to another fencer.  So you may not want to fence at this event so as to let other people qualify.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"1419 Elliot Avenue West","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","zip":"98119","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.630657,"longitude":-122.374112,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":166347,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166348,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166349,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166350,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166351,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166352,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166353,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166354,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166355,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":166356,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":166357,"tournament_id":41807,"tournament":"WWD Div II\/III\/Y14 Divisional Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":42836,"name":"Cherry Blossom Open 2019","start_date":"2019-03-30","end_date":"2019-03-31","comments":"Note: Waivers will only be required for MINORS.

Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778. They can be contacted at 631-821-1131 for directions or assistance. A map can be found at http:\/\/bit.ly\/mfcmap Mission is in the same shopping center as Kohl\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds, Michael\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds, and PETCO. It is across the street from Planet Fitness. If inputting the address into a GPS, you can search for the Rocky Point Post Office which is also located in our shopping center. Ample parking can be found around the back of the shopping center, near the main entrance to Mission.\r\n\r\nMission does have a store with limited stock of fencing equipment. Please call the club for more information.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nPlease note that event times listed are the close of registration. Fencers are required to be checked in by this time. Fencing will begin shortly after registration closes. It is recommended to leave yourself ample time for travel, check-in, and equipment check prior to the close of registration of your events.\r\nWomen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Epee 9am\r\nWomen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Sabre 10am\r\nMen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Foil 9am\r\nWomen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Foil 1pm\r\nMen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Epee 1pm\r\nMen\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Sabre 12:30pm\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/27\/19.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Mission Fencing Center","address":"346 Route 25A","city":"Rocky Point","state":"NY","zip":"11778","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.9436577,"longitude":-72.9427773,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":41,"name":"Long Island","abbrev":"LI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":171572,"tournament_id":43225,"tournament":"LI Div SN Y14 Qualifier 2019","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":171573,"tournament_id":43225,"tournament":"LI Div SN Y14 Qualifier 2019","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":13,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":171574,"tournament_id":43225,"tournament":"LI Div SN Y14 Qualifier 2019","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":171575,"tournament_id":43225,"tournament":"LI Div SN Y14 Qualifier 2019","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":171576,"tournament_id":43225,"tournament":"LI Div SN Y14 Qualifier 2019","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":171577,"tournament_id":43225,"tournament":"LI Div SN Y14 Qualifier 2019","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":41712,"name":"SAS Women's Epee","start_date":"2019-03-30","end_date":"","comments":"Open Women's Epee \/ $20","prereg_open":"2018-09-12","prereg_close":"2019-03-29","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Open Women's Epee \/ $20 registration cash or check.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 12:00 pm and fencing will start soon after close of registration.\r\n\r\nParking info:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.salleauriol.com\/parking\/\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2018-2019) competitive members of the USFA or foreign equivalent.

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of three separate tournaments spread throughout the season, each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on a weighted point formula.\r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\n<b>The Grand Prizes<\/b>\r\n\r\nOur Grand Prizes have been brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event and date, along with a guitar strap, stand and wall mount worth several hundred dollars!  The Overall Series Champion will also have their name and club affiliation engraved on our perpetual trophy cup which is on continuous display!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more info about our club visit www.musiccityfencingclub.com\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Epee \r\nC & Under Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/30\/2019.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/29\/2019.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695067,"longitude":-86.6757848,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":170797,"tournament_id":42999,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Season Finale","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":35,"prereg_count":39,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":170798,"tournament_id":42999,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Season Finale","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":43,"prereg_count":51,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-30T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":170799,"tournament_id":42999,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Season Finale","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":29,"prereg_count":36,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":170800,"tournament_id":42999,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Season Finale","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":33,"prereg_count":45,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-31T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":42745,"name":"2019 2nd Annual SoCal Open","start_date":"2019-03-30","end_date":"","comments":"Top 4 to receive awards.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdincomplete\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd registrant on FRED\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nFencers competing in Div 2\/3 events must follow the rating restrictions set forth by the USFA. Only fencers with a rating of C or lower are eligible to fence at these qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

Maitre Pouj also started several fencing clubs in Central Texas and gave fencing lessons at many high schools in Central Texas.  The whole of the Poujardieu Family was a driving force for the promotion of fencing for men and women for all of its existence , in their native France and here in their adopting country.  After his death in the summer of 1984, it became a memorial and following the passing of his wife, Louise and eldest son, Gerard, Jr. (also a fencing master) the tournament became a memorial to a fencing family.

Eligibility is not restricted to those residing or attending HS in the State of Tennessee.  Participants are not required to have a USA Fencing Membership, however those who have a High School Membership or Competitive Membership with USA Fencing will be eligible to earn ratings (where applicable).

Entry fee is $10\/event.  \r\n\r\n=== Tennessee State High School Individual Champions ===\r\n\r\nTournament Format:  Each event will consist of 1 round of pools with 100% Promotion, followed by a standard Direct Elimination table.\r\nContested Events (6): Men's Epee, Men's Saber, Men's Foil, Women's Epee, Women's Saber, and Women's Foil. \r\n\r\nFinal placement from each event will determine the \"TN State HS Individual Champion\" in that event.   Awards will be given to each finalist (top 3 finishers in each event). There is no limit as to how many fencers from each High School can participate in a single event.  There is also no limit as to how many events a single individual can participate in.  Prior to the start of the tournament, any individual fencing in more than one event must designate which event's result will be considered when calculating the \"TN State HS Squad Champion\".  Although a single fencer may compete and even win the 'Individual State Championship' in multiple weapons, they can only use results from one predetermined event, towards the 'Squad' and 'Overall Team' Championships.   \r\n\r\n=== Tennessee State High School Squad Champions ===\r\n   \r\nUsing the final results from each individual event, points will be awarded to each participant using the following formula: ((# entries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points   *The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThe fencers who combine for the highest total points in an event (maximum of three fencers\/event) will be considered the \"TN State HS Squad Champions\", however the fencers must be from the same HS.  Separate Men's and Women's Squad Champions will be awarded in each weapon.\r\n\r\n=== Tennessee State High School Overall Team Champions ===\r\n\r\nUsing the same process as described above, the HS that combines for the most points across all three weapons is the \"Tennessee State High School Overall Team Champion\".

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 4\/3.
