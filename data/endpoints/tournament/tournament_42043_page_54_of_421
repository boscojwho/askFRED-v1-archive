If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/11\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/13\/2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30629,"tournament_id":6833,"tournament":"\"U\" Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-14T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6616,"name":"Junior\/Senior Bay Cup in San Francisco","start_date":"2008-09-14","end_date":"2008-06-28","comments":"Junior Men's Foil and Senior D-or-Lower Mixed Epee.

Masks, body cords and lames will be subject to equipment control. Sabre cuffs are required. Original seeding for SSCC events will utilize standard seeding protocols for the Southwest Section Circuit Cup. It is the responsibility of the fencer to notify the Bout Committee at the time of registration if they are on the NRPS. One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches. Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. \r\n\r\n<b> USFA Membership<\/b>\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. Proof of membership is required.  Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using  most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\n<b>Waiver of Liability<\/b>\r\nThe Southwest Section Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed. If you are under 18 years of age, this waiver must be signed by a parent or guardian or you will not be allowed to fence.","venue":{"name":"Austin Sports Center in Cedar Park","address":"1420 Toro Grande Blvd.","city":"Cedar Park","state":"TX","zip":"78613","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":30.540079,"longitude":-97.775846,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":68,"name":"South Texas","abbrev":"SOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":28377,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":26,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-20T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":28378,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":21,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-21T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":28379,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":44,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-21T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":28381,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":33,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-20T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":28382,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":28,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-20T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":28383,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-21T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":28384,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":36,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-20T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":28494,"tournament_id":6260,"tournament":"The Austin Challenge-SSCC #1","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":41,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-21T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":6262,"name":"Unclassifed Foil\/Epee\/Sabre Tournament","start_date":"2008-09-20","end_date":"2008-09-21","comments":"We are happy to announce our new unclassified tournament of the new season.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30638,"tournament_id":6836,"tournament":"\"C\" Epee","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-21T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6632,"name":"BFCC Mixed Open","start_date":"2008-09-21","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2008-08-30","prereg_close":"2008-09-20","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"BFC - Columbia","address":"9515 Gerwig Lane, Suite 101","city":"Columbia","state":"MD","zip":"21046","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.171657,"longitude":-76.840711,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":29892,"tournament_id":6632,"tournament":"BFCC Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":29,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-21T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29893,"tournament_id":6632,"tournament":"BFCC Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-09-21T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6716,"name":"RCFC Championship #1 (Epee)","start_date":"2008-09-25","end_date":"","comments":"RCFC presents the first event in our series of in-house championships for the new season.

If fewer than 4 show up, the events will be canceled.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $5 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2008-2009 members of the US Fencing Association (or equivalent), and must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 1998-2001\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1996-1999\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1994-1997\r\nJunior -- Born 1989-1995\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=6482\r\nPreregistation closes on 09\/26\/2008\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
