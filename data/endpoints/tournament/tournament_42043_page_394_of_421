The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

All persons in the venue, including fencers, coaches, referees, and tournament officials must wear a suitable mask covering their mouth and nose at all times, including while on-strip.  Continued failure to comply with any of these requirements is a Group 3 penalty, which may result in exclusion from the competition.  \r\n\r\nFencers, coaches, and officials should not enter the venue if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms of respiratory infection, if they have had a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding 10 days, or if they have been in close contact with a person who was positive for COVID-19 in the preceding 5 days.  Fencers who are prevented from competing in the various qualifying events due to COVID-19 restrictions will be able to petition for entry to the National Championships.  Petitions are handled by the National Office, not the Division.\r\n\r\nBy attending this tournament, you agree that within 10 days of the date of the event, you have not tested positive for COVID-19, or been in contact with someone who has COVID-19. Additionally, you release and hold harmless US Fencing, USFA Philadelphia Division, Temple University, and tournament staff from any and all liability regarding COVID-19 transmission. While state and local regulations will be followed and every other reasonable precaution will be taken, there is an inherent transmission risk associated with being in any public place.","venue":{"name":"Temple University Pavilion","address":"1941 North 15th St.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19121","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9825493,"longitude":-75.158755,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194393,"tournament_id":49882,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-30T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":194394,"tournament_id":49882,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-30T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":194395,"tournament_id":49882,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-30T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":194396,"tournament_id":49882,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-30T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":194397,"tournament_id":49882,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-30T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":194398,"tournament_id":49882,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Nationals Qualifier: Y14","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-04-30T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"}]},{"id":50138,"name":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2022","start_date":"2022-04-30","end_date":"","comments":"Join us April 30th, 2022 for our annual Stephen Lazar Memorial tournament.

Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website.\r\n\r\nEach events tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 3 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the Bout Committee immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and the tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Fencers are responsible for checking all scores before leaving the strip.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS:\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications.

Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT:\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

All persons in the venue, including fencers, coaches, referees, and tournament officials must wear a suitable mask covering their mouth and nose at all times, including while on-strip.   Continued failure to comply with any of these requirements is a Group 3 penalty, which may result in exclusion from the competition.  \r\n\r\nFencers, coaches, and officials should not enter the venue if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms of respiratory infection, if they have had a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding 10 days, or if they have been in close contact with a person who was positive for COVID-19 in the preceding 5 days.

Additionally, you release and hold harmless US Fencing, USFA Philadelphia Division, Temple University, and tournament staff from any and all liability regarding COVID-19 transmission.

There will be NO exceptions to COVID-19 safety protocols implemented throughout the tournament. If you cannot comply do not register for this tournament. Anyone (fencer or coach) refusing to comply with safety protocols will be escorted from the venue. These protocols and tournament modifications due to COVID-19 are up for change at anytime. \r\n<i>Entry to the venue<\/i>\r\n- Coaches and spectators MUST have completed a COVID vaccine series (Pfizer 2 shots, Moderna 2 shots, or Johnson & Johnson 1 shot) 14 days prior to arrival at the venue OR have proof of a negative COVID test no more than 72 hours prior to the tournament. \r\n\r\n- Only athletes, tournament staff, and coaches who hold a valid USFA Coach membership will be allowed to enter the fencing floor.

Fencers may bring a small tripod to record their bouts or stream to an outside party but placement of the tripod may not be in any place that will cause a safety concern or hinder the running of the event. These concerns will be determined by the referees, and final discretion lies with the Bout Committee. Tripods and phones\/cameras are at your own risk. The Division, venue, tournament, etc. will not be responsible for any broken equipment. \r\n\r\n- No congregating or gathering in any doorways, hallways, or walkways.\r\n\r\n- When you have finished fencing in your event, please gather up your belongings quickly and leave the building immediately.

Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! \r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information: <\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.
