Qualification occurs by \"competing\" in a DIV II\/DIV III event for the weapon you would be interested in fencing for VET's at Summer Nationals. Qualification is limited to DIV II\/DIV III eligible fencers rated C and Below. Qualification for VET events is not dependent on your placement in the DIV II\/III qualifier (and is therefore automatic based solely on participation). However, any placement within the top 25% would additionally qualify you to compete in a DIV II\/DIV III event as allowed by your placement and classification. Therefore, a separate VET qualifier is not necessary, and will not be fenced. \r\n\r\nFinal results, if applicable, and ALL qualifying notices with instructions for registering for Summer Nationals with USA Fencing will be sent to qualifying fencers NLT Sunday, April, 28, 2019.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you may contact me, if by email at larry@indianafencing.org or by phone at

If there are at least 5 girls and 5 boys, we will separate the event by gender. Medals will be given to the top 4 boys and top 4 girls in each event.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful.  Future date is May 11.\r\n\r\nFencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver (attached) to participate. All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome! Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\nFor additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\nBrenda Waddoups\r\nFencing Institute of Texas, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=42822\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/22\/2019\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

This tournament's events use birth year eligibility for the 2018-2019 season.\r\nIf you are not eligible by BIRTH YEAR, but have NATIONAL POINTS for the age group one younger than the event you want to enter, you are eligible to fence in that age group. For example, if you are born in 2008, you may only enter Y14 if you are on the Y12 National Points List for the same weapon.\r\nNOTE: At this time, askfred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible. If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please contact the organizers for additional registration information.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>REGISTRATION & PAYMENT DEADLINES:<\/b>\r\nPreregistration opens on 03\/28\/2019.\r\nRegular registration and online payment ends on 04\/24\/2019 at midnight, central time.\r\n\r\n<b>FEES:<\/b>\r\nRegistration: $25\r\nEvent: $15\r\nLate Fee: After 4\/24\/19, an additional $150 late fee will be incurred.\r\n\r\n<b>Payment is required to complete registration.<\/b>\r\nIf a fencer misses a payment deadline they will be required to pay the next higher fee schedule. No Exceptions. \r\nChecks should be made payable to North Texas Division. If paying at the door with cash, exact change is required. No Credit\/Debit Cards.\r\n\r\n<b>REFUND POLICY:<\/b>  Refund requests must be made prior to midnight, 04\/23\/2019. The registration fee is not refundable. The event fee will be refunded less FRED fees and postage. No refunds will be issued for event no-shows.  Refunds will be processed within 3 weeks after the tournament. The NTX Division follows the refund policy of the USFA. \r\n\r\nIf a fencer meets the classification requirement when his or her application is processed by the Division, and subsequently earns a higher classification, the fencer retains eligibility for that tournament.\r\n\r\n<b>FENCE OFF FOR THIRD:<\/b> If there are more than three fencers, but fewer than 13, third place must be fenced. Where there are 13 or more fencers in the final results, third place does not have to be fenced.\r\n\r\n<b>We will not fence an event if 3 or fewer fencers are signed up as all three will qualify. <\/b>Fencers will be listed as DNF (did not fence). \r\nPer USFA guidelines, to qualify you must still pay registration and event fees and be present at the tournament.\r\n\r\n<b>Waiver of Liability<\/b>\r\nThe North Texas Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed <b>(by parent or guardian, not a coach)<\/b>.

Initial seeding will be by classification and year, then randomly.\r\n\r\n<b>EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES:<\/b>\r\nStandard fencing uniforms without any rips, tears, or holes are required. Warm-up pants are not allowed on strip. \r\nNames on uniforms are not required.\r\nFencing glove must cover half of the forearm with no rips or holes. \r\nStandard fencing plastron (underarm protector) is required; women must wear chest protector.\r\nMask must pass a 12K punch test. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\nCords, lames, and masks are subject to standard electrical resistance checks. At least two working body cords, mask cords, and 2 working weapons are required.\r\n\r\n<b>USFA Membership<\/b>\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. Proof of membership is required. Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using most current USFA membership data. Fencers\/Parents, please ensure YOUR email and not your coach's email is in the Askfred database. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership.

A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen 'cause it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nWe have equipment available to rent for $15 (MTFC Members no charge).  If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR FOIL\r\nThis is a mixed gender, mixed age event. To spice things up and get more fencing in for everyone we are likely going to do a sharks-and-minnows format. In this format there is the usual first round of pools with seeded fencers separated. So each pool will have pretty experienced fencers mixed in with beginners. Those who do the best in the first round (the sharks) will be put together for the second round of pools. And everyone else (the minnows) will also have a second round among themselves. That way the sharks can beat each other up. And the minnows can have a more even chance to be the biggest guppy. At least the top two sharks will have a final bout as an exhibition and as motivation for our beginners. Maybe the top minnows can have a finals, too. As you can see, the tournament organizers can make things up as they go to try to get our kids the most fencing and best practice.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES\r\nWe have room for 30 total fencers. You snooze, you lose. So just click the \"Preregister\" button right now. However, if we are full and some poor fencer cannot register because you signed up but knew you were not going to make it, we may \"accidentally\" erase your future registrations because of the whole karma thing (like for all of eternity). So please be kind to your fellow fencers and unregsiter (via the AskFRED e-mail) if you cannot make it. (And yes, we will take pity on you if you come down with some highly contagious disease the night before the event so do not make it even if you are registered.)\r\n\r\nSEEDING\r\nWe will probably seed by classification then highest national rank then randomly in case you were wondering. Sort of weird because we will take your national rank (if you have one) regardless of age and gender group and combine it. But this is sort of what is done with the 50-59 year old group when the 49 year olds age out....\r\n\r\nPrizes will be awarded for first to third place.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens now.\r\nPreregistration closes on April 26.","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":171160,"tournament_id":43089,"tournament":"MTFC Youth Foil Tournament - No More SNOW!","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":30,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-04-28T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":42069,"name":"Escrimeur Youth Sabre Cup 2018-2019 (7)","start_date":"2019-04-28","end_date":"","comments":"IMPORTANT!

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.
