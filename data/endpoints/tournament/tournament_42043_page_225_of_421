You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 Novice event is for fencers who have never fenced a tournament before, or have only fenced one of our Novice events previously. Fencers will need to upgrade their USA Fencing membership to the Competitive version.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2000-2003\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=27727\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/31\/2014\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

In any tournament where children can fence with adults, the fencer must be 13 by January 1 of the competition season (August - July).\r\n \r\nMixed = Men & Women combined. \r\n\r\nElectric gear is required for all USFA Events. All USFA Foil Events require mask with conductive bibs and mask cords.\r\n\r\nYouth Development Practice Tournaments: DESF will begin a new format for practice tournaments for youth. This format is designed to assist youth to have a fuller learning experience at fencing tournaments and to address youth events that have had historically low turnouts. The format involves fencers as volunteer mentors to assist in creating bouting opportunities for youth with the goal of developing a stronger local field of youth fencers. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nNovice DESF Practice Tournaments: Novice Events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability. These events are sponsored by DESF as practice tournaments for new fencers and are not Northeast Division sanctioned USFA events. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nPre-registration & Entry Fees:\r\nUSFA sanctioned events:\r\nEntry fees: $20 per event at the door. $15 per event if you pre-register on Ask-FRED by Friday, 10\/31\/14. These fees only apply to DESF hosted tournaments. Pre-registration closes Friday, 10\/31\/14 at 9:00 PM.\r\n\r\nYouth Development, Novice and practice events: $10 per event per person. If you are a designated volunteer mentor for the youth development events, it is free to participate.\r\nPlease let us know if you would like to volunteer.\r\n\r\nThe Mixed Junior Foil & Epee - Wheelchair is a debut event due to the presence of a guest para-olympian in our area fencing with our club. Since we have not yet obtained official wheelchair equipment yet, we have modified this event for any fencers to participate in this practice wheelchair simulated format. More information will be given at the tournament. We invite any fencers who would like to participate to sign-up. \r\n\r\nCourtesy of pre-registration is highly encouraged, but those wishing to register at the door are welcome. All volunteer donations to the referee fund are welcome and highly appreciated to help pay or discount the entry fees of those who volunteer to referee. When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USFA Events will be awarded according to USFA tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

Participation may qualify fencers for the Y10 or Y12 competitions at North American Cups (as age appropriate), or Summer Nationals. For details on the new qualification paths for youth, see: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources and click the \"Qualification\" tab at the bottom.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Note: At least 2 athletes must compete (have fenced) in a given RYC age\/weapon event to fulfill eligibility requirements. Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed will not result in the athlete fulfilling qualification requirement. i.e. Y14 events will need to have at least two athletes of the same gender to be a qualifying event.\r\n\r\n<b>BRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD!<\/b> All fencers must be current USFA members and be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership. Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. \r\n\r\n<b>Full USFA uniform is mandatory,<\/b> including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or sabre, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. All Y10 fencers will be required to use size \"0\" or size \"2\" blades (i.e., less than 32.5 inches long). Foil events require conductive foil masks.\r\n\r\n<b>Equipment checks will be conducted.<\/b> Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event. Limited types of replacement equipment may be available at SFC (Salem). We will be open on Friday from 4-6 pm equipment checks. We encourage people for later events to check equipment early. If you are fencing Sunday, please come by on Saturday to get your stuff checked and approved, and help us reduce lines the day of your event. Thanks!\r\n\r\n<b>Age Requirements (2014-2015 Season only):<\/b>\r\nY10: Birth years of 2004 - 2007\r\nY12: Birth years of 2002 - 2005\r\nY14: Birth years of 2000 - 2003\r\n\r\n<b>Pre-registration on AskFred is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Tuesday Oct. 28, 2014<\/b> (i.e. FOUR days before the event) If you are pre-registered by the deadline, pay just $15 per fencer registration fee and $10 per event at the door (i.e. $25 for one event and $35 for two events.) After the close of regular pre-registration time to 9pm of the day prior to the tournament, fencers are welcome at triple registration fee and double event fee (i.e. $45 to register and $20 per event), if organizers are notified via email (info@salemfencingclub.org). The day of the event you may fence with a walk-in fee of double triple (i.e. $90 per fencer and $60 per event.) However, we don\u0092t want that, so please just register on time and save yourself some money.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that we only accept <b>cash or checks<\/b>. CREDIT CARDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED. Please make checks out to Salem Fencing Club. \r\n\r\nAn affordable and healthy lunch will be available onsite from Black Sheep Catering, a local food cart (http:\/\/blacksheeporegon.com\/). Other options are available within walking distance. Snacks and beverages will be for sale throughout the day onsite.\r\n\r\n<b>Coming from out of town?<\/b> Spend the weekend in Salem! We have a variety of affordable hotels very close to the venue. Give us a call at 503-375-9209 for recommendations.

Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash.

While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-NORTH","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108113,"tournament_id":27331,"tournament":"FAP-North Y10, Y14 Sabre & Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-01T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108114,"tournament_id":27331,"tournament":"FAP-North Y10, Y14 Sabre & Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-01T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108115,"tournament_id":27331,"tournament":"FAP-North Y10, Y14 Sabre & Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-01T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27846,"name":"RMCC Invitational Team Competition","start_date":"2014-11-01","end_date":"2014-11-02","comments":"","prereg_open":"2014-09-11","prereg_close":"2014-10-30","authority":"CFF","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"The Royal Military College of Canada Presents the 45th Annual RMCC Team Invitational\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled (Events begin 30 minutes after the following close of registration times):\r\n\r\nSaturday November 1, 2014\r\n8:00am - Men's Team Epee\r\n10:30am - Women's Team Foil\r\n12:00pm - Women's Team Sabre\r\n\r\nSunday November 2, 2014\r\n8:00am - Men's Team Foil\r\n10:30am - Women's Team Epee\r\n12:00pm - Men's Team Sabre\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/11\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/30\/2014.\r\n\r\nEntry Fee  \r\nOUA Teams: $100 per team (pay at door)\r\nClub Teams: $120 per team \r\n$150 per team if received after October 30, 2014 (including day of event)\r\n\r\nFormat\r\nThis tournament shall be run in accordance with FIE and CFF rules and regulations, subject to the interpretation of the Directoire Technique.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2013-14 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2014, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1994-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1995-2001 and for the cadet events 1998-2001.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing). If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete. Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter. Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Nevada division's qualifiers. If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (director@redrockfencingcenter.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (702-222-1901). \r\n\r\nEntry\r\n\r\nAll events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event. Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Pacific Time) on the Saturday before the Sunday events. If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $20 and $20 per event. There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration and per event fee(s) or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations. All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change) or check.\r\nNo refunds! If you need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail by 11\/01 to receive credit towards a future event. \r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age. For the 2014-15 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2015, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1995-2001 except that a fencer born after 2001 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event. Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1998-2001 except that a fencer born after 2001 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event. After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1996-2002 and for the cadet events 1999-2002.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: One round of pools with 100% promotion to Direct Elimination.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event. \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.

There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

It is for beginners to get a taste of tournament competition. To be eligible for the novice a fencer must have been fencing less than one year! For example: A fencer who has fenced and\/or competed in epee or sabre for a couple of years but only recently picked up a foil is not a novice. This is for fencers who have very little tournament experience and for their parents.\r\n\r\nCompetitive USFA membership is not required for the novice event. We do require the $10.00 non-competitive membership for the Novice events. Those memberships may be taken at the door.\r\n\r\nThe conductive foil bib is NOT required for novice foil.\r\n\r\nBefore registration in the novice competition begins, there will be an introductory talk with the fencers and parents to walk them through various aspects of tournament fencing.\r\n\r\nThe novice event may be broken into separate events based upon age and size, at the discretion of the tournament organizers, at the time of the tournament. The novice event format will be determined by the tournament organizers at the time of the competition. Novice events will be round-robin pools plus direct elimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Waiver:<\/b>\r\nAll competitors must submit a copy of the Gulf Coast Division waiver of liability and consent to treat form.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
