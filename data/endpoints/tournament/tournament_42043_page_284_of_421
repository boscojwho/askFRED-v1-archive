You may join, renew, or upgrade your membership here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership\r\n\r\nTIMES FOR JO QUALIFIER EVENTS ARE NOW POSTED. IF AN EVENT DOES NOT HAVE A POSTED TIME, IT WILL NOT BE FENCED.\r\n\r\nThis tournament IS RUNNING CONCURRENTLY with the SC Division Bookends tournament on the same day in the same venue.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: PRE-REGISTRATION WITH PAYMENT IS REQUIRED TO FENCE JO QUALIFIERS.  \r\n\r\nREGULAR FEE registration ends Sat, Nov. 19th.\r\n\r\nFINAL registration closes Sat, Nov. 26 at midnight, two weeks before the event.  No late registrations or payments will be accepted after this date.  NO WALK-INS and NO EXCEPTIONS. \r\n\r\n\r\nENTRY & ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nIndividual event times will be posted as soon as possible the week after registration closes and may be revised up to 48 hours before the event.  It is your responsibility to review event times and to check-in ON TIME at your event, or you will be scratched from competition.  No refunds for late arrivals. (Since all registrations and payments are two weeks in advance on askFRED, there is only Check-In and no registration at the JO Qualifiers.) \r\n\r\nFencing will typically start approximately 15 minutes after close of Check-In!  Please arrive earlier to have your equipment checked and allow warm-up and check-in time. Venue will be open at least 1 hour prior to close of check-in for the first event on Dec. 11. \r\n\r\nAll registrants pay a one-time Registration Fee of $20 if paid by Saturday, Nov 19, or $40 if paid between Nov 20-26, plus an event fee of $20 for each event entered. (So, if you register for one event on or before Mon, Nov 19, you will pay a total of $40 ($20 registration and $20 entry fee for one event). If you register for two events before Nov 20, you will  pay a total of $60, i.e., $20 registration plus $20 for each event.) The registration fee will increase to $40 after Monday, 11\/19\/16, but entry fees remain $20 per event. \r\n \r\n\r\nAll registrations and payments must be completed by SATURDAY, 11\/26\/16 at 11:59PM Eastern Standard Time. If having difficulty on AskFRED or you prefer to pay by check, please contact chair@scfencing.org in advance for instructions since late registrations and payments will not be accepted after 11\/26\/16.   \r\n\r\n\r\nNote that askFRED validates fencers for gender, age and division. It will not allow you to register for events you should not be in. If you feel you should be able to register for an event and askFRED is not allowing you to do so, please verify that your profile information in askFRED is correct for gender, age and division. If you still have a problem, contact the division chair at chair@scfencing.org\r\n\r\nIf there are 3 or fewer fencers pre-registered for an event after the close of registration on 11\/26\/16, the event will not be fenced, and the fencer does not need to attend the event. Those fencers will auto-qualify for the JO's in February even though they do not fence.\r\n\r\nThe Registration and event fees for unfenced events will be refunded (minus askFred fees) but only if requested in writing (email) and received by 12\/18\/16 (one week after the tournament).  No shows and fencers arriving late forfeit all fees.  Fencers withdrawing between Nov 27-Dec 10 will only receive refunds for entry fees, but forfeit the registration fee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced (Read more here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility Note that fencers with national points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail chair@scfencing.org to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer born after 2003 will be allowed to fence the Cadet JO qualifier IF the fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the entry deadline (Nov 26) for this qualifying tournament.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and South Carolina Division Sanctioned event; ratings will be awarded where earned.

PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n800N Saber Glove Mandatory for All USA Fencing Sanctioned Tournaments Beginning on Oct. 1, 2015\r\n \r\nIn conjunction with the updated amendments to the Federation Internationale d'Escrime Rules, the USA Fencing Board of Directors has voted to mandate that all saber athletes must use a glove that meets the protection requirements listed below in all USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments beginning on Oct. 1, 2015.\r\n\r\n    The material of the fencing glove must have a level of protection of 800N on the areas shown in the diagram below, the seams a minimum strength of 200N and cuff a level of protection of 350N. The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n     \r\n    The conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\n    In order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\n    The conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION INFORMATION, DEADLINES, COSTS:\r\n\r\n Registration fees (including all convenience fees and costs to register online and pay with a credit card) follow, with listed deadlines:\r\n\r\n ---Regular online registration period runs through 11\/15\/2016\/till 11:59pm\/ EXTENDED TILL 11\/21\/16 \r\n $30 Non refundable registration plus $40 per event \r\n\r\n---DOUBLE FEE-From NOV 16 till December 1\/till 11.59pm\/EXTENDED TILL 12\/5\/15\r\n $ 60 Non refundable registration plus $ 80 per event\r\n\r\n --- TRIPLE FEE-From December 2\/2016 through December 9\/ 2016\r\n $90 registration plus $120 per event \/ EXTENDED TILL 12\/13\/16\/\r\n\r\n*REFUND:\r\nDeadline for REFUND request is on Friday, December 2\/2016 @ 11:59 pm.\r\nPlease make a separate email with \"REFUND\" as the subject.\r\nMake sure that you include your mailing address in the email.\r\nRefund will be sent 2 weeks after the tournament.\r\n\r\nPLEASE REED:\r\n\r\nAt this time, Askfred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible.

US Fencing Association membership required.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nC & Under Senior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info -------------------\r\n\r\nTournament: MTFC C and Under Senior Mixed Foil #2\r\nDate: December 16, 2016\r\nClose of Registration: 6 PM\r\nLocation: Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Tacoma, WA\r\n\r\nWe are physically located at 1106 South 15th Street, Tacoma, WA 98405 in the Sons of Norway building called \"Normanna Hall\" at the corner of 15th and Martin Luther King. Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 6 PM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter. Traffic going south to Tacoma can be heavy at that time because housing in Pierce County is much more affordable than in King County so please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED. $25 per fencer at the door. Credit card payment will incur a $2 surcharge.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $15 to use it for the night which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear for the new season.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2016-2017 season. You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. A foil mask with conductive bib and mask cord are required. Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2003 or earlier\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/27\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/15\/2016.","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"1106 S. 15th Street","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","zip":"98405","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.2476436,"longitude":-122.4511347,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":139160,"tournament_id":35150,"tournament":"MTFC C and Under Senior Mixed Foil #2","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":17,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-12-16T18:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":35689,"name":"Grossmont Stab-a-Thon","start_date":"2016-12-16","end_date":"","comments":"You\u0092re Invited!
