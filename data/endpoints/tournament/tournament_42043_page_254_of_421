You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2003-2006\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2001-2004\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=31372\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/06\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

The Denver Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, the Pepsi Center, Coors Field, the History Colorado Center, and the Denver Art Museum are all clustered in the downtown area.  In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly. REI\u0092s flagship store, with its four story climbing wall, the Downtown Aquarium, and Elitch Gardens amusement park are about 1.3 mile walks from downtown.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to range a bit further, The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a can\u0092t miss attraction for lovers of all things dinosaur. Next door to the Museum of Nature and Science is the Denver Zoo. The new Elephant Passage exhibit recently opened.  See\u00a0http:\/\/www.denver.org\u00a0for detailed information about even more events and performances.\r\n\r\nThe Denver Super Shuttle can be used to reach the hotel from the airport.\r\nHere is a link to the Denver Super Shuttle:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.supershuttle.com\/Locations\/DENAirportShuttleDenver.aspx\r\n\r\nThe Denver RTD Light Rail can be used to reach the Evans station, which is the closest station to DFC.

Any classifications in USA Fencing Events will be awarded according to USA Fencing tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nOn-Sale Items from the DESF Fencing Flea Market:\r\nDESF will provide a table for still on-sale items from the DESF fencing flea market which was formally held at out last Maine Season Opener.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

Foreign fencers must be current members of their nation's fencing federation or posess FIE license.\r\n\r\nCompeting in RYC provides fencers with valuable competitive experience at the local\/regional level and are intended to prepare you for larger national events. RYC serve as a qualifying path for Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. \r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level.    RYC serve as a qualification path to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings>>>Current Rankings>>>Regional.  These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events.  All athletes who fence at an RYC will earn regional points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Given the current number and concentration of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, it was determined that up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. \r\n\r\nForeign fencers can compete at any RYC. If they compete out of Region they will not appear on that Region\u0092s Point List nor will points from an outside region transfer to an athletes point total in their home region. Railstation will sort them out. However, their participation will be counted in the overall entrants and be included when the points are calculated for the fencers who competed in their home region. A fencer can ONLY win the Regional Patch Award for the Region they reside in. \r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y10\/Y12 March NAC: <\/i>Fencers must fence in at least one RYC or SYC in the current season, OR be on Y10 or Y12 points list to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the NAC\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path to Y14 NAC<\/i>:  Be age eligible\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y10 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y10 NRPS, OR Be on your Y10 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in the Top 65% of your region\u0092s Y12 Regional Youth point standings.\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y12 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y12 NRPS, OR Be in Top 8 of Y10 NRPS, OR Be in the Top 65% of your region\u0092s Y12 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in Top 30% of your region\u0092s Y14 Regional point standings, OR Be in Top 25% of our Division\u0092s Y14 Qualifier\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y14 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y14 NRPS, OR Be in Top 16 of Y12 NRPS, OR Be in the Top 30% of your region\u0092s Y14 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in Top 25% of our Division\u0092s Y14 Qualifier\r\n\r\nThe Athletes Handbook (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook)is the definitive reference document regarding points and qualification paths.\r\n<b>==================================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>REGISTRATION AND EVENT FEES <\/b>\r\n\r\nRegular registration and payment deadline is October 25, 2015.

If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 11\/4\/15. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 11\/4\/15) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2015-16 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2016, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1999-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1997-2003 and for the cadet events 2000-2003.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661646,"longitude":-73.9793924,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":121987,"tournament_id":30965,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #2 Men's Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":23,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-11-08T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":31338,"name":"NJFA - Div III & Y-14 M&W Foil November 10","start_date":"2015-11-10","end_date":"","comments":"Close of check-in promptly 6:00PM!!

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.
