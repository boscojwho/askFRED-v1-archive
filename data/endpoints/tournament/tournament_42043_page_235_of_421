Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0974096,"longitude":-75.1452389,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113935,"tournament_id":28769,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Y14 Foil and Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-02-22T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113936,"tournament_id":28769,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Y14 Foil and Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-02-22T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28312,"name":"Brooklyn Fencing C & Under, D & Under Feb Foil","start_date":"2015-02-22","end_date":"","comments":"$40\/event for fencers pre-registered on AskFRED; $60 walk-ins at the door.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for ZFA events for the next calendar year. This means that you won\u0092t be able to pre-register via AskFRED and you will have to compete as a walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Men's foil \u0096 9:00 am\r\nSenior Women's foil \u0096 12:00 pm\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/20\/2015.\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Zeljkovic Fencing Academy.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 2\/22\/14.

The defeated will continue on through their own tableau. Teams are eliminated after their second loss regardless of which tableau in which they are fencing. \r\nFYI: At most team events, there are no pools, and teams are eliminated after their first defeat in DE's, meaning collectively they scored less points than their opposing team.\r\n\r\nStrips will most likely be self-refereed. Instruction on how to use a team scoresheet will be given at event to team captains.\r\n\r\nFYI: Team Events:\r\nTeam competition involves teams of three fencers. A fourth fencer can be allowed on the team as an alternate, but as soon as the fourth has been subbed in, they cannot leave and must fence to the completion of the event. The opposing team must be alerted of this substitution at least one round before it happens.\r\n\r\nThe modern team competition is similar to the pool round of the individual competition. The fencers from opposing teams will each fence each other once, making for a total of nine matches. At the beginning of the team match, each team fills out one side of a score sheet with the order they will fence in. Teams are not aware of the order their opponents will be fencing in, although the sheet is designed so that no two athletes will fence each other twice.\r\n\r\nMatches (or bouts) between teams are three minutes long, or to 5 points, as in the pools. There are important differences, however: each match the score carries over, and the maximum score for each match is increased by 5. For example, lets imagine that Fencer A from Team 1 and Fencer X from Team 2 finish their first bout at 5-3. Next, Fencer B and Fencer Y step on the piste. They will be fencing to 10 points, but Fencer B starts at 5, and Fencer Y starts at 3, right where their team-mates left them. This means that Fencer Y can still pull ahead, if she scores 7 points before Fencer B scores 5.\r\n\r\nImagine, however, things go slowly, and after three minutes the total score is 8-6. Although neither fencer reached the limit of 10 total points for this match, the next pair to fence will still be able to go as high as 15. In other words, the maximum score for each round continues increasing by 5 regardless of how many points were scored in the previous match.\r\n\r\nSince there are 9 matches, the highest score possible is 45 points. However, the winner is simply the team with the highest score at the end of the ninth match, even if it is less than 45. While sabre almost inevitably goes to 45, it is not unusual to see an \u00e9p\u00e9e score in the mid to low thirties. If there is a tie at the end of the ninth match, then the usual tie-breaking rules apply, and it is the same two fencers who will do the tie-breaker match.\r\n\r\nTeam tournaments sometimes use pools and elimination rounds, although this is not so common, and they usually begin in a direct elimination format. The seeding of the teams in this case can be random, or based on the performance of the individual members (if it is a tournament with both), or even based on the results of the same team at other tournaments (for example if it is a national team). \r\n\r\nFor more info, read Chapter 6 of the USFA Rule Book.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Lebanon YMCA Fencing Club","address":"","city":"Lebanon","state":"PA","zip":"17042","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2927633,"longitude":-76.3868797,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":27,"name":"Harrisburg","abbrev":"HARR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":115143,"tournament_id":29106,"tournament":"Lebanon YM Unsanctioned Epee Team Event","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"SrMxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-02-28T09:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29134,"name":"SAS Feb Youth Foil","start_date":"2015-02-28","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2015-02-01","prereg_close":"2015-02-27","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nY10 Mixed Foil - 11:00 am\r\nY12 Mixed Foil - 12:30 pm\r\nY14 Mixed Foil - 11:00 am\r\n\r\nPosted times reflect the close of registration and events will begin as close to this time as possible\r\n\r\nENTRY\r\nThis event is sanctioned by the Western Washington Division and ratings can be awarded.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USFA competitive membership is required.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot behind building, enter from Glenside Avenue. We are Suite 201, Building C.  Bring food and drink, their are changing rooms but no showers.  The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0974096,"longitude":-75.1452389,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113940,"tournament_id":28773,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Y14 & Y12 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-01T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113941,"tournament_id":28773,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Y14 & Y12 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29030,"name":"Duel in Hollywood","start_date":"2015-03-01","end_date":"","comments":"Cost: $30 for the first event, $15 for additional events.","prereg_open":"2015-01-22","prereg_close":"2015-03-01","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Hollywood Sabre Fencing Academy","address":"1318 N Dixie Highway","city":"Hollywood","state":"FL","zip":"33020","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":26.0231592,"longitude":-80.1497106,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":114843,"tournament_id":29030,"tournament":"Duel in Hollywood","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":10,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-01T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":114844,"tournament_id":29030,"tournament":"Duel in Hollywood","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":15,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-01T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":114845,"tournament_id":29030,"tournament":"Duel in Hollywood","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-01T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":114846,"tournament_id":29030,"tournament":"Duel in Hollywood","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29047,"name":"WWU Tournament 2015","start_date":"2015-03-01","end_date":"","comments":"$5 registration fee at the door.

The tournament will follow the typical USFA format. Fencer\u0092s will be initially seeded and broken up into pools. The fencers will then be placed into a tournament bracket and will compete until one fencer emerges as the winner. Medals will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, & 3rd place.\r\n\r\nFencers will also earn points based on where they finish in the event. The three best finishes from each competitor will be added together to create the overall score. The three competitors with the highest point totals will receive additional awards following the completion of this event. This format favors not just the most skilled fencer, but also the most consistent and the most dedicated. The more events you fence, the better shot you have of taking home the grand prize.\r\n\r\nThe overall leader will be declared the Epee Grand Champion and will receive a custom-made championship belt to honor their achievement. \r\nPoints will be awarded as follows:\r\nEach direct elimination bout victory earns 3 points\r\nEach direct elimination bout loss earns 1 point\r\n\r\nONLY YOUR THREE BEST TOURNAMENT FINISHES WILL BE COUNTED TOWARDS YOUR OVERALL SCORE.\r\n\r\nThis is a non-USFA event. Masks will be the only equipment checked prior to the start of competition. All fencers must wear full fencing gear including knickers and a plastron.

RYCs serve as a qualifying path for Y10, Y12 and Y14 at the Summer National Championships to be held in San Jose, CA - June 27-July 6, 2015.  \r\n\r\nTo participate in the Y10, Y12 and Y14 Summer National events, fencers must qualify - RYCs serve as a qualifying path:\r\n\r\nY10 (born 2004-2007): Be on Y10 Regional Youth point standings at the regular fee entry deadline for these Championships.  One RYC IN YOUR REGION accomplishes this. \r\n\r\nY12 (born 2002-2005 or be on the Youth 10 NRPS): Be in the top 50% of your region\u0092s Y12 regional point standings OR\r\nbe in the top 4 of your region\u0092s Y10 regional point standings at the regular fee entry deadline for these championships.\r\n\r\nY14 (born 2000-2003 or be on the Youth 12 NRPS): Be in the top 25% of your region\u0092s Y14 regional point standings OR\r\nbe in the top 8 of your region\u0092s Y12 regional point standings at the regular fee entry deadline for these championships.\r\n   \r\n\r\nA Y12 or Y14 fencer's top three Regional point scores from RYCs in the fencers Region are added up.  It is Utah-Southern Idaho Division's plan to host three RYCs.  If you do not fence in all of them, your kids are at a significant disadvantage to kids from other states in our region or will have to travel out of state to fence three RYCs and be competitive with fencers who do.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe qualifying requirements for the April Youth NAC are simply that Y10 and Y12 fencers participation in ANY RYC in ANY Region or in an SYC.  Y14 has no previous participation requirements for the April NAC.\r\n\r\nFencers from outside of Utah should be aware that the Utah-Southern Idaho Division is quite small and that this is exacerbated by the fact that USA Fencing excludes our Southern Idaho clubs from Region 4 RYCs. As a result, our RYCs are all small and despite our best efforts to dragoon fencers and schedule men's and women's event so they can be combined at the last moment, some events are likely to be cancelled for lack of two participants. Accordingly, we are requiring that all pre-registrations be approved.  This will be automatic for local fencers but we want to communicate with out of state fencers to clarify and coordinate the risks - so email us.\r\n\r\nThat being said, come play!  \r\n\r\nEvents
