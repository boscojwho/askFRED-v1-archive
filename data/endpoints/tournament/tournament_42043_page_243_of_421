Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

In 1995, the wolf, an integral member of the wilderness ecosystem, was reintroduced to Yellowstone Park.  The Wolf Project studies the long-term impact on the Park's ecosystem.  Over the past three years we've raised fifteen thousand dollars . As a thank-you, the Yellowstone Park Foundation sent us a wonderful cast of a paw print. We are having this made into a special trophy and the winners of this year will have their names engraved on it alongside the past three year's Alpha Wolfs. \r\n\r\nParticipants in this youth fundraiser are encouraged (but not required) to join the pack and seek sponsors to back them as they battle for the title of Alpha Wolf. Sponsorship forms, allowing sponsors to pledge per point scored, will be emailed to preregistrants. Fencer\/fundraisers will receive a special commemorative wristband.  After the competition, sponsors will receive an email with their pledge amount and a link for online donation.\r\n\r\nWe have wolf-themed prizes for medalists, as well as a prize in each age group for the fencer with the greatest number of sponsors.\r\n\r\nThe fundraising web site is: https:\/\/www.crowdrise.com\/fences-with-wolves\r\n\r\nRegistration fee is $35 for preregistered fencers and $45 at the door.

When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USFA Events will be awarded according to USFA tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 5\/20\/15. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 5\/20\/15) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 9:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 9:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nVET COMBINED EPEE: 1:00 PM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 Novice event is for fencers who have never fenced a tournament before, or have only fenced one of our Novice events previously. Fencers will need to upgrade their USA Fencing membership to the Competitive version.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2000-2003\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=27730\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/29\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
