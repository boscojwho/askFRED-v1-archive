A working lunch will be provided.  \r\n\r\nBackground:  Medieval fencing sets the theoretical parameters for the modern sport - all of the major concepts that we see reflected in today's performance have roots in Medieval swordplay.  Therefore it makes sense for today's masters to understand Medieval fencing as the basis for current technique and tactics.  Medieval swordplay also makes business sense as a product line for those with a serious interest in the Middle Ages, a growing market.\r\n\r\nFocus:  Teaching the Medieval longsword, sword and buckler, and halberd - what does the fencing coach need to know about the history, technique, and teaching of these weapons?\r\n\r\nContent:\r\n\r\n(1) teaching safely - including use of exercises and scenarios and teaching people to aim off safely\r\n(2) unifying thoughts of Medieval weapons systems - probably about three hours on the floor to look at common concepts of distance, timing, point and edge, use of continuous attacks, concepts of guard positions (not as guards but as transitional points), footwork, and the transition between swordwork and wrestling technique.\r\n(3) what this teaches us about modern fencing - almost every concept we have in modern 3 weapon fencing is defined first in the medieval period\r\n(4) sources of information - and how you interpret the sources\r\n(5) sources for weapons\r\n(6) structuring skill progression and competition\r\n\r\nCourse handout: we will share the Salle Green Fechtbuch - a compilation of information on principles and execution of the weapons.\r\n\r\nCost: $40.00 check or cash at the door\r\n\r\nUnited States Fencing Coaches Association continuing education hours: 6\r\n\r\nContact the organizer for directions, lodging choices, etc.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 05\/13\/2007.\r\nPreregistration closes on 07\/13\/2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Green","address":"11058 Washington Highway","city":"Glen Allen","state":"VA","zip":"23059","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":37.70318,"longitude":-77.464694,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":62,"name":"Virginia","abbrev":"VA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":17696,"tournament_id":3778,"tournament":"Teaching Medieval Weapons Coaches Workshop","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-07-14T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":3350,"name":"Sweaty Sunday Singles Foil Event","start_date":"2007-07-15","end_date":"","comments":"Hosted by the Underground Fencing Organization","prereg_open":"2007-01-31","prereg_close":"2007-07-14","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Hosted by the Underground Fencing Organization\r\n\r\nFees: $20 for the open event\r\n\r\n\r\nDone with the event?
