Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82489,"tournament_id":20010,"tournament":"FAP Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-10-14T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19251,"name":"NJFA  Youth (Y8-Y14) - Youth Cup #1","start_date":"2012-10-14","end_date":"","comments":"Late fee period.. must now pay on-line to secure any remaining available slots (incomplete entries will be removed).

Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nThe Y10\/Y12 event is for fencers born in 2000 or later. All other events are for fencers born in 1999 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. The Div III event is for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2012-2013) competitive members of the USFA or CFF. All fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $30+tax per team. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19713\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/19\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

A's fence for $10 off, B's fence for $5 off.  \r\n\r\nRemember the days before most fencing rule changes were dictated by the IOC and FIE almost entirely in order to make fencing more \"audience friendly,\" at least in theory? Whether you do or don't, the MARS Musketeers \"Back in the Day\" Tournament hearkens back to this time. With some exceptions, the 1974 Amateur Fencers League of America Rule Book will be in use. (The AFLA was the USFA's predecessor.) \r\n\r\nIn brief summary: Bouts are of five touches with a time limit of six minutes. There is no direct elimination: the tournament is composed of round robin pools or roughly six fencers to a final of six. (For what it's worth, this format was in use fencing-wide for roughly a century, and was devised by epee fencers.) Double defeats apply: in other words, if the score is 5-5 or is tied when time is up, both fencers are counted as defeated. Corps \u00e0 corps is not called, nor the bout halted, unless there is jostling or brutality, in which case normal penalties apply. There is no ridiculous non-combativity rule, although fencers must fence to the best of their abilities as usual. \r\n\r\nCoaching in any form is not permitted during bouts. One may neither coach nor encourage a fencer during a bout, although applause is allowed. Please note that ratings cannot be earned in this format. Proof of USFA membership is required for insurance, but it need not be competitive membership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/27\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/19\/2012.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Central Church of Christ","address":"407 Clinton Avenue East","city":"Huntsville","state":"AL","zip":"35801","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":34.733675,"longitude":-86.5825349,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":54,"name":"Alabama","abbrev":"AL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":83222,"tournament_id":20203,"tournament":"MARS Musketeers Old School Open","full_name":"Vet40 Mixed Epee","short_name":"V40MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Vet40","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-10-20T10:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":83223,"tournament_id":20203,"tournament":"MARS Musketeers Old School Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-10-20T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20209,"name":"Gopher Open 2012","start_date":"2012-10-20","end_date":"2012-10-21","comments":"","prereg_open":"2012-09-27","prereg_close":"2012-10-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"<b>Saturday \u0096 Open House<\/b>\r\nThis will be a non-sanctioned event.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82490,"tournament_id":20011,"tournament":"FAP Unclassified Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":23,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-10-21T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19247,"name":"Freehold Fencing Youth Sabre","start_date":"2012-10-21","end_date":"","comments":"Y12 Mixed Sabre starts at 10:30 a.m\r\nY14 Mixed Sabre starts at 12:00 p.m\r\nThis event is sanctioned by the NJ division of the USFA.","prereg_open":"2012-08-11","prereg_close":"2012-10-21","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Y12 Mixed Sabre starts at 10:30 a.m.\r\nY14 Mixed Sabre starts at 12:00 p.m.\r\nThis event is sanctioned by the NJ division of the USFA. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY12 Mixed Saber\r\nY14 Mixed Saber\r\n\r\nAll fencers must wear required fencing attire and bring at least 2 working weapons and 2 working body cords.
