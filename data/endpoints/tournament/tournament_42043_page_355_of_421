Other competitive opportunities in the ROC tournaments are provided for Veteran (40 & Older) and Division II (C, D, E or U) fencers.   ROC tournaments are open to current USA Fencing competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses.   However, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USA Fencing National Championship events. In the event that a foreign fencer finishes within the qualifying group, the foreign fencer will be skipped and only the highest-finishing eligible domestic fencers will qualify. \r\n\r\nIn each ROC category (Division I-A, Division II, and Veterans) competitions will award points to the top 40% of the competitive field (rounded up to the next higher integer) to a maximum of 64th place, using the point tables for regional competitions found in The Athlete\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Handbook  Appendix 2.5.   Only the best 3 results, in each respective category, count towards the point total. These points may qualify D1A, DV2, and Veteran ROC fencers to the USA Fencing National Championships in D1A, DV2, DV3, and Veteran.    The ROC point standings are not used for seeding National level tournaments.  Only ROC events award regional ranking points.\r\n\r\n**Entry is determined by 2019-20 USA Fencing birth year requirements and rating restrictions: \r\n\r\nDiv I-A: Born 2006 or before, or on the Junior National Rolling Points List, and with any rating \r\nDiv2: Born 2006 or before and with C,D,E or U rating \r\nVeteran:  Born 1980 or before\r\n\r\n<b>REGIONAL YOUTH CIRCUIT<\/b>\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/ryc-resources\r\n\r\nThe RYC tournaments are held throughout the season, similar to the Super Youth Circuit tournaments. There are no national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships. Fencers only earn points at RYCs within their home region (your Region is assigned based on Division affiliation). Only the best 3 results count towards the point total. These points may qualify Youth fencers to the USA Fencing National Championships. Points earned at Regional Youth tournaments are not considered in determination of national point standings; they are only reflected in regional point standings.

Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf?_ga=2.44686689.433513283.1547236097-1943416123.1546365588 \r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.

If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>$60 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 11\/6.

If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up.
