The following policies apply:\r\n\r\n* A social distancing and safety plan will be in effect. Details will be provided at the tournament, but will include MANDATORY FACIAL COVERINGS. Facial coverings must be worn while fencing and when within 6ft of other people. If you are 6ft from other people outside your travel\/family group, you can be without a mask.\r\n\r\n* If you are sick, PLEASE STAY HOME. This tournament is entirely for fun. Medals will be made of chocolate. That's how serious this is and how much we want you to fence only if you are able to do so in a manner that is safe for our fencing community.\r\n\r\n* This event will be self-refereed. Coach Greg will probably fence and also run BC. Older fencers are expected to stick around after senior foil to ref youth fencers. It takes a village.\r\n\r\n* Pre-reg closes on the Thursday night before to ensure we have an accurate count for the county. Events are capped at 21 fencers per event.\r\n\r\n* We are on tennis court #4.\r\n\r\n$20 per event. First event $30 if not pre-registered. \r\n\r\nYou must have a USA Fencing membership (competitive or non-comp OK) or qualify for a free trial membership.\r\n\r\nFull fencing kit required for senior foil and epee. For youth foil, fencing pants and conductive bib not required.

Please buy a generous number of raffle tickets ($1 each or 6 for $5).  The drawing will take place in the middle of the day (after epee fencers have signed in but before they start fencing).  Winners need not be present.  Lots of great prizes!\r\n\r\nAll fencing will be electric.  VFA members who do not own their own electric equipment should arrange with Viveka in advance to borrow what you need.  Equipment will be \"yours\" for the day, no sharing.   Since we can not share masks, the mask bib is optional for novice foil fencers (experienced foilists are expected to bring and use their regulation electric foil masks).\r\n\r\nThere is a single portalet in the E. Middlebury park, as well as a water fountain (for covid safety, do not drink directly from it, use only to refill water bottles).  There is nowhere to change clothes, so come dressed in a way that does not require privacy to get ready to fence.\r\n\r\nCovid Safety\r\n\r\nAll fencers must wear a covering over mouth and nose during all bouts and any time that physical distance of 6+ feet can not be maintained.  You might want to bring more than one, in case yours gets sweaty.\r\n\r\nBring your own hand sanitizer, and use it after handling equipment others have touched (i.e. reels and machines).\r\n\r\nBring your own water bottles and snacks, do not share with others.\r\n\r\nWear your face mask when refereeing, as well as when fencing.\r\n\r\nDo not attend this tournament if you feel sick with any possible covid-19 symptoms, you suspect you may have been exposed to someone with covid-19, or you or any member of your household has traveled out of state (except to approved quarantine-free counties) within 14 days of the event.  There is no penalty for withdrawing from the tournament.\r\n","venue":{"name":"East Middlebury rec park-outdoor tennis courts","address":"School House Hill Rd","city":"E.

We understand a lot of clubs aren't active during COVID re-opening, and people are going from place to place. We have an associate membership for people who want to fence here while retaining a primary membership elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNormally it's $60 per month if you're committed to 12 months.\r\n\r\nFor August, September and October we're discounting it to $45. You can pay by paypal for a single month, for all three months, or subscribe to pay monthly for three months.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to come for open bouting any night we are having bouting. Since we're offering at least two nights per week for each weapon this can save you money over the floor fee.\r\n\r\nSo if you're looking to get some bouting in, whether your club is available or not, we wanted to make this option available to people in the community, to get good bouting with cool people from various clubs in a nice setting.\r\n\r\nLinks are included for the floor fee, or the discounted associate membership option.\r\n\r\nAssociate Single Month Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DKRMZMFHQD232\r\n\r\nAssociate Three Months Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PT5P6H55MFWPN\r\n\r\nAssociate Member 3 Month Subscription Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZTSKC3QUDBRFQ\r\n\r\nFloor Fee Single Night\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RCKLX79XB7C2L\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\n\r\nSafety Measures\r\n\r\nBaltimore County is now requiring masks for all indoor activities therefore masks will be worn throughout practice.

There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when.
