The committee reserves the right to change the schedule based on the number of entries received for any one event. If fewer than 3 entrants are registered for an event, the event will not be fenced, entry fees will be refunded, and the entrants will automatically qualify for the Junior Olympic Championships. Entrants will be notified by email no later than Friday, January 6th if an event will be held or if an event has changed time and \/ or date. If an e- mail address is not available, all efforts will be made to contact the entrant by phone.  Times listed are for close of check-in. All fencers must check-in prior to the listed time  or they will be scratched from competition. WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND Checking \r\nemail for schedule changes. \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nPLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION\r\n\r\nQualifying Paths for the 2006 Junior Olympic Championships\r\n\r\nFencers must be US Citizens or permanent residents of the United States who meet qualification standards specified below to enter USFA National Championships. Fencers must be able to show a USFA Competitive Member card with an expiration date of 7\/31\/06 or later and have the Georgia Division as their recorded division. For the Under 17 (Cadet) Junior Olympic Championship events, fencers must be born between 1989 and 1992. If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at the Division Qualifier if the fencer is on the Youth 14 national point standings. Fencers who are on the national Cadet point standings on January 17, 2006, or, who are among the top 8 of the Youth 14 national point standings on January 17, 2006, are automatically (or pre-) qualified to compete in the 2006 Junior Olympic Championships.\r\n\r\nIf a fencer has not met either of these pre-qualification criteria, then the fencer must have fenced in his or her Division Qualifier and finished in the top 25% of the field of fencers for that event.\r\n\r\nFor the Under 20 (Junior) Junior Olympic Championship events, fencers must be born between 1986 and 1992. If younger than that, a fencer may be eligible to compete at the Division Qualifier if the fencer is on the Cadet point standings. Pre-qualfiers for the Junior Championships are those on the national Junior point standings as of January 17, 2006, or in the top 16 of the national Cadet point standings as of January 17, 2006. Otherwise the fencers must qualify from their Division qualifying competition by placing in the top 25%of the field. In exceptional cases, a member of the USFA in good standing may qualify by petition. A successful petition would come from a fencer who qualified for the same competition the prior season, or whose current competitive record indicates a strong possibility that he or she would have qualified had he or she been able to compete in the qualifying tournament. For information on procedures for qualifying by petition, please consult the downloadable USFA Athlete handbook at www.usfencing.org. Note: No petition may contravene the results of a qualifying competition a fencer who has fenced in the  competition without withdrawing due to valid medical reasons cannot then petition to disregard or override those results. Determination of the number of Qualifiers based on the 25% rule: If fewer than 3 fencers are entered for any event, the event will not be fenced and the entrants will be automatically qualified.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Atlanta Fencers
