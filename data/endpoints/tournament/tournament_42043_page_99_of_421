If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.

All fencers will be required to fence 1 pool round of foil and 1 pool round of epee.  Both pools will be combined to seed to a direct elimination bracket.  Immediately before each direct elimination bout, the bout committee chair will flip a coin.  If the coin lands HEADS, the bout will be a foil bout; if the coin lands TAILS, the bout will be an epee bout.

Events will be run co-ed only if fewer than 6 fencers of either gender for the age category. Bring your USFA card or be ready to register at the door (credit card # or separate check payable to USFA).\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y12 points will be allowed to fence Y14s.)\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled (close of registration):\r\nSunday, 6\/13:\r\nY10 Women's Foil 8:00 am\r\nY10 Men's Foil 8:00 am\r\nY12 Women's Foil 10:30 am\r\nY12 Men's Foil 10:30 am\r\nY14 Women's Foil 1:00 pm\r\nY14 Men's Foil 1:00 pm\r\n\r\nFencers may register here for $30 or at the door for $45. \r\nPre-registration closes Weds, June 9.\r\n\r\nFencers planning to fence two age groups are advised there will be some overlap between events (you may have to fence some Y12 DE bouts during your Y14 pool if you're doing well in the Y12s).  Directors are used to this and will not scratch your bouts if you're fencing in the other event; however, fencing in two events is your choice - please be ready to fence a few bouts in a row if need be to keep your events moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Center","address":"62 4th Street","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip":"11231","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41498,"tournament_id":9554,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y10 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y10WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-13T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":41499,"tournament_id":9554,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y10 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y10MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-13T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":41500,"tournament_id":9554,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-13T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":41501,"tournament_id":9554,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-13T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":11354,"name":"GFA Epee Open","start_date":"2010-06-13","end_date":"","comments":"$35 for paid preregistration, $40 for preregistration with payment at the door and $45 for registrations on the day of the event.
