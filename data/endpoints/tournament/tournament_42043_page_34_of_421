This is to protect the floor and they will be strictly enforcing it, which means we will, too. We will be providing areas for snacking at other places in the building close to the venue area, as well as the cafeteria. These places will be well marked. Basically, anywhere other than the gym. The locations of area restaurants will also be provided.\r\n\r\nWest Des Moines schools are a non-smoking area. That includes the grounds, so they tell us. Keep it in mind!\r\n\r\nTo register:\r\n\r\nWeb Form: http:\/\/www.askfred.net\r\nEmail: dmfc@mchsi.com\r\nPhone: (515) 225-8085\r\n\r\nSnail: DMFC\r\n3004 Maple Street\r\nWest Des Moines, IA
