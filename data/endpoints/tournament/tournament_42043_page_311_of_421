If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - New Bucks County Location","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":150541,"tournament_id":37903,"tournament":"6th Annual Liberty Chinese Food & Movies Tournamen","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-24T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150542,"tournament_id":37903,"tournament":"6th Annual Liberty Chinese Food & Movies Tournamen","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":4,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-24T10:15:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150543,"tournament_id":37903,"tournament":"6th Annual Liberty Chinese Food & Movies Tournamen","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-24T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150544,"tournament_id":37903,"tournament":"6th Annual Liberty Chinese Food & Movies Tournamen","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-24T10:15:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150546,"tournament_id":37903,"tournament":"6th Annual Liberty Chinese Food & Movies Tournamen","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-12-24T12:15:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":38924,"name":"Boxing Day Bash","start_date":"2017-12-26","end_date":"","comments":"Boxing Day Bash, time to start a new tradition.

Uniform of the day is whites or black and whites.\r\n\r\nRules:\r\n(1) everyone can fence any weapon against any opponent - fencers agree on the weapon for their bout\/bouts.  No one may refuse a bout against another fencer.\r\n(2) 5 touch bouts.  Fencers must leave the strip at the end of the bout to record results.

You know you were hit, take the hit, and move on.  This competition is about fencing bouts as fast as possible.\r\n(5) mixed by gender and by age group - everyone fences everyone.\r\n(6) the winner is the fencer who fences the most bouts - win or lose, the most bouts.  In case of a tie, fencer with the most touches scored wins.  In the case of a further tie, fencer with the fewest touches received wins.\r\n(7) you must try - no tucking your head down and running forward to get hit as quickly as possible.\r\n(8) 10 minute break at 1 hour.\r\n(9) you can come late, leave early, etc.  Doors open at 10:30 am.

These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and will serve as a qualification path to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.

Our address is 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 10:00 AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 for the event.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE DISCOUNTS (may be combined): $5 off if preregistered on AskFRED because everyone should use AskFRED, $5 off for fencers with a classification (rating) as we want to encourage our most experienced members to participate as well and be role models for our beginners, and $5 off for rated referees who will help referee during this event.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. Adults and children with all different levels of experience will be fencing together. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen because it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nBeginners are welcome to use club electric equipment. Competitive fencers are expected to use their own equipement. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR FOIL\r\n\r\nThis is a sharks and minnows foil event which is not a typical USFA format but provides better opportunity for practice. We will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools as is standard for USFA tournaments. There will be a second round of pools to follow with a separate \"sharks\" group for the top fencers (after the first round of pools) who will be protected to advance to the possible direct elimination round. All the \"minnows\" will be sorted based on their first round pool performance for their second round of pools with other minnows. Direct eliminations will follow based on the second round of pools likely only from the Sharks pool but who knows. Not everyone will advance to direct eliminations though this format will allow two rounds of pools with the second round more equal in fencing strength which is more and better fencing for everyone. Those who are eliminated after the pools are encouraged to watch the higher level fencers, ask questions, and learn some new tricks as well as enjoy the company of other MTFC fencers and families.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR EPEE\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of event which is likely smaller than the foil group the anticipated format with be standard pools, 100% promotion to direct eliminations, and a full direct elimination round.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT CHANGES\r\nTournament coordinators may change the format for either or both weapons to try to maximize fencing and fun for all participants without keeping everyone forever.\r\n\r\nREFEREEING\r\n\r\nThe rounds will be self-directed by fencers who are rated referees and claim their $5 discount.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee and Mixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens now.\r\nPreregistration closes on 1\/6\/2018.","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":157011,"tournament_id":39436,"tournament":"New Gear Open (foil and epee)","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-07T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":157012,"tournament_id":39436,"tournament":"New Gear Open (foil and epee)","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":12,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-07T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39216,"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Jan Youth Foil","start_date":"2018-01-07","end_date":"","comments":"$45\/event for fencers pre-registered; $65 walk-ins at the door.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 1\/3\/18.

Parents and fencers are advised that blades marketed as \"#0\" or \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however blades labeled as #0 or #2 but are longer than 32.5 inches, are not permitted.\r\n\r\nEquipment check will be open each day of the competition at 7:00 am. Equipment check will test the mask, lame jacket and foil mask bib, gloves and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\" All events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: Underarm plastron, 2nd weapon and body cord, weapon check control marks.  Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nFailure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 7-8am on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nNote that Absolute Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order. \r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\n\r\nSeeding for all events is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking within year classification. Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Clash will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nPoint Standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\nRatings Information: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list\r\n\r\nThis information will be obtained from USA Fencing on Monday, January 9. Any discrepancies regarding classifications or points earned must be resolved by this date.\r\n\r\nEach event's tentative seeding will be posted at the venue prior to the close of check-in. It will also be posted at http:\/\/live.capitolclash.org.\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION INFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS\r\n\r\nFailure to report to a strip timely for the start of a bout subjects the fencer to disqualification according to USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nNo flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2003-2006\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=38279\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/12\/2018\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
