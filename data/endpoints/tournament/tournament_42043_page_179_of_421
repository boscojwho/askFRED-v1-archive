Please do not block driveways or use the parking areas of other businesses in the neighborhood. \r\n\r\nThe city of Denver offers a multitude of activities that will be of interest to visiting fencers and their families.  Restaurants and micro-breweries are varied and plentiful.  The Hilton Gardens is a brief RTD light rail trip to, and the downtown Courtyard Marriott, is within easy walking distance of, the Denver Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, the Pepsi Center, Coors Field, the newly opened History Colorado Center, and the Denver Art Museum.  In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly.  REI\u0092s flagship store, with its four story climbing wall, the Downtown Aquarium, and Elitch Gardens amusement park are about 1.3 mile walks.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to range a bit further, The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a can\u0092t miss attraction for lovers of all things dinosaur.  Next door to the Museum of Nature and Science is the Denver Zoo.  The new Elephant Passage exhibit recently opened.

Membership forms will be available at the meet. Membership forms will be available at the meet; form can be downloaded at http:\/\/usfencing.org\/assets\/documents\/attached_file\/filename\/44785\/2011-12_Individual_Membership_Application.pdf or membership can also be paid online: http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\r\n* USFA rules will be enforced. With regard to safety, each fencer must wear full fencing clothing, including a sous-plastron (under-arm protector), knickers, and long socks. Masks will be punch-tested for safety at the event.\r\n* We understand that electric equipment can be a difficult issue for youth fencers and their parents, but in order to keep the meet running smoothly, each fencer should have his\/her own lame (foil\/saber), electric mask (saber), and primary body cord and weapon. USFA rules require each fencer to have a second body cord and a second weapon by the strip; sometimes these may be shared amongst teammates\/friends, however the spare equipment should be at the strip during your bouts.\r\n* Blade length for Y10 fencers must be stamped '0' (30 inches long) or '2' (32 inches).

Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx\r\n \r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers  MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event.  Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Eligibility Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n \r\nFencers competing must be <b>current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member USA and of the Long Island Division.<\/b> To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87618,"tournament_id":21414,"tournament":"FAP Unclassified Y-10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-07T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21434,"name":"Cobra OPEN - Epee\/Foil  (NJ Cup Event)","start_date":"2013-04-07","end_date":"","comments":"NJ Cup Event - $40 if reg\/paid on-line (deadline April 5); \/$50 if reg but pay at door; $60 walk-in (Apr 6-7)...

\r\n* Youth fencers may fence in a second event ONLY if the start times are at least an hour apart.\r\n* Times posted are close of registration. Fencers should plan to show up at least 20 minutes earlier to allow time to check in and warm up.\r\nYear of Birth:\r\n* Y14 - 1998, 1999, 2000,2001\r\n* Y12 - 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003\r\n* Y10 - 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005\r\n* Fencers are *strongly* encouraged to discuss with their coach which event(s) are right for them.\r\n* Format: Y14 - one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination round of 15-touch bouts\r\n* Format: Y12 and Y10 - one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination round of best two of three 5-touch bouts\r\n* If there are at least 6 boys and at least 6 girls in one event, the event will be split into two events based on sex. Otherwise the event will be mixed boys and girls.\r\n\r\nRULES and EQUIPMENT\r\n* All fencers must be members of the United States Fencing Association (USFA). Membership forms will be available at the meet. Membership forms will be available at the meet, however, the USFA now charges an additional fee for processing hardcopy memberships; for online membership, renewals, and 1-day memberships, go to https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/MembershipRegistration.aspx\r\n* USFA rules will be enforced. With regard to safety, each fencer must wear full fencing clothing, including a sous-plastron (under-arm protector), knickers, and long socks. Masks will be punch-tested for safety at the event.\r\n* We understand that electric equipment can be a difficult issue for youth fencers and their parents, but in order to keep the meet running smoothly, each fencer should have his\/her own lame (foil\/saber), electric mask (saber), and primary body cord and weapon. USFA rules require each fencer to have a second body cord and a second weapon by the strip; sometimes these may be shared amongst teammates\/friends, however the spare equipment should be at the strip during your bouts.\r\n* Blade length for Y10 fencers must be stamped '0' (30 inches long) or '2' (32 inches).
