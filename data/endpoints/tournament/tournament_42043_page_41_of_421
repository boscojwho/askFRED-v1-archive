With regard to safety, each fencer must wear full fencing clothing, including a plastron (under-arm protector), knickers, and long socks. Masks will be punch-tested for safety at the event. \r\n* We understand that electric equipment can be a difficult issue for youth fencers and their parents, but in order to keep the meet running smoothly, each fencer should have his\/her own lame (foil\/saber), electric mask (saber), and primary body cord and weapon. USFA rules require each fencer to have a second body cord and a second weapon by the strip; these may be shared amongst teammates\/friends, however each fencer should know where his or her secondary equipment is. \r\n* Blade length for Y10 fencers must be 30\" or 32\" inches long\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Twin Cities Fencing Club","address":"741 Holly Avenue","city":"St. Paul","state":"MN","zip":"55104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":44.94335,"longitude":-93.131617,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":35,"name":"Minnesota","abbrev":"MN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":22729,"tournament_id":4966,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-13T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":22730,"tournament_id":4966,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-13T14:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":22731,"tournament_id":4966,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-13T12:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":22732,"tournament_id":4966,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-13T13:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":22733,"tournament_id":4966,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-13T11:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":22734,"tournament_id":4966,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-13T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
