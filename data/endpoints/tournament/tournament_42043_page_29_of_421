If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournaments.  The top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify, so the more fencers that show up, the more people qualify.\r\n\r\n**** IMPORTANT NEWS ****\r\nThis year, the USFA has changed the rules on qualifying for Division II and III.  The only way to qualify for Div II and III is to fence the Div II\/III event.  In prior years, qualifying for U16 automatically qualified you for Div II\/III.  THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, this year we will fence the qualifiers as a standard tournament - one round of pools to a DE - instead of the grueling all-pools format.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  Event schedule ------------------- \r\n\r\n---- Thursday 4\/12\/07 ----\r\n*** At SALLE AURIOL SEATTLE ***\r\n7:30 pm\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Saber\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Saber\r\n\r\n---- Friday 4\/13\/07 ----\r\n*** At RAIN CITY FENCING CENTER ***\r\n7:30 pm\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Foil\r\n\r\n---- Saturday 4\/14\/07 ----\r\n*** At SALLE AURIOL SEATTLE ***\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Epee\r\n11:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Epee\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Foil\r\n\r\n---- Sunday 4\/15\/07 ----\r\n*** At SALLE AURIOL SEATTLE ***\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Epee\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Saber\r\n11:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Foil\r\n12:00 Noon\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Saber\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.

If you are unable to attend you must notify us *at least 24 hours before* the competition and we will credit you for a future competition.  Absolutely no refunds the day of the event.  If you need to withdraw for any reason, please notify us at info@brooklynfencing.com ahead of time (even if you have not pre-paid) so that we can prepare appropriately.\r\n\r\nSpecial notes for qualifying events: this year the USFA has discontinued 'trickledown' qualification; you must fence each event you wish to qualify for.\r\n\r\nTEAM EVENTS: teams should be registered by the club (individuals should not register separately for team).  At least 3 fencers from the same club *must* be present at close of registration in order to qualify your team regardless of whether teams must actually fence or not. \r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/11\/2007.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs usual, all fencers must bring their USFA card or be prepared to sign up at the door ($50, bring a credit card # or separate check).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Center","address":"62 4th Street","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip":"11231","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.676964,"longitude":-73.993939,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":12490,"tournament_id":2751,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Quals-Jr & Cdt","full_name":"Junior Men's (max 1 per club) Team Foil","short_name":"JrMFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"(max 1 per club)","close_of_reg":"2007-04-14T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":12492,"tournament_id":2751,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Quals-Jr & Cdt","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-04-14T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":12493,"tournament_id":2751,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Quals-Jr & Cdt","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":23,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-04-14T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":12495,"tournament_id":2751,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Quals-Jr & Cdt","full_name":"Cadet Men's Foil","short_name":"CdMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-04-14T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":12509,"tournament_id":2751,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Quals-Jr & Cdt","full_name":"Junior Women's (max 1 per club) Team Foil","short_name":"JrWFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":1,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"(max 1 per club)","close_of_reg":"2007-04-14T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":17312,"tournament_id":2751,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Quals-Jr & Cdt","full_name":"Cadet Women's Foil","short_name":"CdWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":3291,"name":"North Carolina Division II\/III and Team Qualifiers","start_date":"2007-04-14","end_date":"2007-04-15","comments":"Registration deadline at regular fee, March 14, 2007.

Once you get into town, you will quickly come upon the main entrance to Ohio Northern University at College Avenue. Turn onto College Avenue and enter the university. After two stopsigns, there will be a parking lot on your right. Park here. McIntosh will be the building to the left as you enter the parking lot. It has a fountain and a set of colonial pillars at the main entrance. Enter through this entrance, and continue to your right until you run into the fencing tournament.  \r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"McIntosh Student Center","address":"525 S.
