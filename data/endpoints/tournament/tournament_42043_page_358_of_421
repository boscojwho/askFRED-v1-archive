Fencers who are age eligible for Y10 and Y12 should only register for ONE of the age groups.***\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful.\r\n\r\nFencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver (attached) to participate. All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome! Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\nFor additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\nBrenda Waddoups\r\nFencing Institute of Texas, Inc\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=45771\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/06\/2019\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

When you remove your name from the list the day of the event THAT IS A NO SHOW.  You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a 1 minute break at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, and Cadet event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has some of these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, and Cadet events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14 and Cadet events will require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nEvents require a minimum of 4 fencers to be run.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of fencers of each gender.\r\n\r\n<b>Non-TFA Fencers:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nNon-TFA fencers should email the organizer to request registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, chest protector (must for girls), mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't yet have proper fencing knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers in Y12 and above events will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow like: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Pitt Meadows Heritage Hall","address":"12460 Harris Road","city":"Pitt

Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.
