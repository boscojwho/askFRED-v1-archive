The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

The organizers understand the concerns that many fencers will have regarding health and safety protocols . For this reason, the organizers have communicated an expectation to each club hosting an event that they will meet or exceed the standard set for NACs (masking at all times and proof of vaccination or recent negative test) in addition to complying with all local laws. While the organizers will attempt to provide updates via social media, given the speed with which policies can change, the most definitive information regarding health and safety protocols will always be found by calling the club hosting the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WILL THE CUP WINNER DETERMINED?\r\n\r\nIn addition to individual event awards, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2021-2022 Cup Standings at the end of the season will be recognized. Awards will be given after the season's final event. 2021-2022 Cup Standings will be determined as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Each fencer will get credit for points earned at up to three 2021-2022 Cup events (assuming the currently anticipated five events; if a sixth event is added, points can be earned at up to four events)\r\n\r\n2. For each 2021-2022 Cup event, fencers will receive points based on their finish and letter ratings of other participants who finish below them:\r\na. Each fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)\r\nb.

He especially enjoys coaching parents of fencers as his own parents never understood the sport and only ever saw one of his competitions.  As he turns ninety, he still fences and coaches two to three days per week and credits fencing with maintaining his long, active life.\r\n\r\nPlease join us in wishing him a happy birthday to eat, drink and fence!!\r\n\r\n<b>Events Scheduled:<\/b>\r\nSenior Mixed Epee:    <b>10:00am<\/b>\r\nY12 & Y14 Mixed Foil: <b>10:30am<\/b>\r\nSenior Mixed Saber:    <b>1:00pm<\/b>\r\nSenior Mixed Foil:     <b>2:00pm<\/b>\r\nSenior Women's Epee:   <b>2:30pm<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Registration Caps Added<\/b>\r\nDue to the large number of entries, we have decided to cap the size of events to allow for a better experience for those attending.\r\nBased on current entries and what we have space for, events will be capped as follows:\r\nSenior Mixed Epee:    <b>91<\/b>\r\nY12 & Y14 Mixed Foil: <b>28<\/b>\r\nSenior Mixed Saber:    <b>28<\/b>\r\nSenior Mixed Foil:     <b>35<\/b>\r\nSenior Women's Epee:   <b>35<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Pricing:<\/b>\r\n$50 for first event, $40 for each additional event.\r\nFood included with first event fee (it's a party!).\r\nPaid at door.\r\n\r\n<b>Covid Policies<\/b>\r\nWe will be following USA Fencing NAC policies for this event.\r\nPlease be prepared to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative covid test.

Winners usually can win small prizes.  For the last few Saturdays, winners were awarded Allstar-Uhlmann tournament socks.  While waiting for their turn, kids are encouraged to sit in the same general area, socialize, and have fun!\r\n\r\nOnce this event gets big enough, larger prizes will be awarded.  And, winners' names will be published in the Patch, the Star-Ledger, and other publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Background Information.<\/b>  With the increased number of fencing clubs these days, young fencers have found some difficulty finding similarly aged or skilled opponents at their clubs.  COVID has made this worse as some classes have gone from 20 kids to 4.  Many fencers have turned to tournaments to overcome these shortcomings but they have some drawbacks.  Fencers wait long times to fence with only a limited number of bouts.  They can also be overly competitive and stressful.  The costs can also be prohibitive.\r\n\r\nThis weekly fencing event attempts to remedy this.  It brings kids from all over NJ and NY to come together and just fence for fun.  It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter what club you are affiliated with as it is open to all.\r\n\r\nMany fencing coaches have expressed concern that this is an attempt to poach their students.  This is not the case.  To let you know, I am a father who is simply creating a venue for his 2 middle-school children to have fun fencing.  I am not affiliated with NJFA or any other club.  I don't get paid for this as the $5 daily fee directly goes to NJFA for facility usage.  I firmly believe that private lessons at your fencing club are essential for becoming a good fencer so please do not quit your club, thinking this event is sufficient for your growth!\r\n\r\nThis event also will not derail your coach's technique.  If this was true, then official tournaments would be harmful as well.  The more you practice, the better you become.  The more varied opponents you practice against, the more experience you gain.  This is what this weekly meet aims to accomplish in an enjoyable atmosphere.  Instead of fencing the same practice partners at your local club, you get to fence kids from all over the NY metro area.  You'll get to meet people with many different styles and various levels of skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cost.<\/b>  $5 per visit (which is really cheap!).  The first time is free so you can try it out.  Venmo, Zelle, or other alternative payment options are available.  (My Venmo is @EdwinKim777.)  If you would like to donate, please do so.  I'll put the extra money into bigger prizes!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Help Wanted.<\/b>  I would love any help regarding this activity.  If you would like to officiate bouts or help oversee things, please let me know.  When I fenced in high school, Masters was the largest and the most successful club.  It succeeded because the kids had a lot of fun.  This made them want to come more often, which in turn made them better fencers.  Help me replicate that same environment here.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested or have additional questions, please feel free to email me at edwinkim777@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEddie","venue":{"name":"NJFA","address":"50 Burnett Ave","city":"Maplewood","state":"NJ","zip":"07040","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7205472,"longitude":-74.2593683,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":189338,"tournament_id":48563,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":189339,"tournament_id":48563,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":189340,"tournament_id":48563,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":49079,"name":"When Life Gives You Lemons, or maybe Grapefruit","start_date":"2021-10-30","end_date":"","comments":"Baby lemon and\/or grapefruit trees as prizes to the top 4 finishers.\r\nThere may be candy involved.\r\nUSFA membership not required.","prereg_open":"2021-10-05","prereg_close":"2021-10-29","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Entry fee for fencers is free.\r\nWe are asking for a $5 donation from spectators.\r\n\r\nWe hope to host a series of these practice tournaments at very low or no cost to participants this season.\r\n\r\nUSFA membership not required.\r\n\r\nIn lieu of medals the top 4 finishers in each event will receive a potted lemon or grapefruit tree.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY10 & Y12 Mixed Non-Electric Saber\r\nSenior Mixed Epee (Electric gear is required.)\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/05\/2021.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/29\/2021.","venue":{"name":"Bluff Grange","address":"8567 State Route 163","city":"Millstadt","state":"IL","zip":"62260","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":38.5349248,"longitude":-90.104453,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":36,"name":"St. Louis","abbrev":"STL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":191255,"tournament_id":49079,"tournament":"When Life Gives You Lemons, or maybe Grapefruit","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y10Y12 Mixed Non-Electric Saber","short_name":"Y1012MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"Non-Electric","close_of_reg":"2021-10-30T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":191256,"tournament_id":49079,"tournament":"When Life Gives You Lemons, or maybe Grapefruit","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-10-30T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":49132,"name":"All Hallows Open","start_date":"2021-10-30","end_date":"2021-10-31","comments":"$75 Gift Cards to 1st Place Finishers.
