This upgrade can be done on a personal device.<\/li>\r\n<li>Those in a \"pending\" status who refuse to upgrade to a Competitive Membership at the event will not be allowed to participate in KSG.<\/li>\r\n<li>Any discrepancies between the USFA and a fencer's membership status will be handled by the fencer. It is the fencer's responsibility to contact the USFA and request a refund.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nPREREGISTRATION AND REGISTRATION:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>CLOSE OF PREREGISTRATION is 7\/15\/23, one week before the event.<\/li>\r\n<li>Fencers are to pay registration and event fees via KSG at https:\/\/bit.ly\/3pynceh .

Men and women will still medal separately in mixed events.<\/li>\r\n<li>Masks with exchangeable bibs are allowed. If the inspection mark is placed on the bib, be sure not to change out your inspection mark!<\/li>\r\n<li>This fencing year in particular saw several rule changes. Fencers are responsible for knowing and abiding by all rules.<\/li>\r\n<li>All gloves will be checked by the armorer for integrity of material. No tears or holes will be permitted (except for those that allow for the body cord).<\/li>\r\n<li>For safety and insurance purposes, fencers and coaches must wear the full fencing uniform while participating in drills, lessons, or warm-ups with weapon in hand. Failure to comply is a Group 3 penalty.<\/li>\r\n<li>KSG charges an admission fee for spectators (anyone not competing, officiating, or volunteering). Spectators include family members, and coaches, of the athletes.

Their pupils had medals at Olympic Games (Moscow 1980, Beijing 2008), World and European Championships in Cadets, Juniors, and Seniors. \r\nMy accomplishments include wining 3 National Titles, 13 medals from National Championships and wining the European Junior Championships in 2006.\r\n\r\nCoaching details:\r\nMy coaching experience began in 2017. Becoming a Master Fencing Coach in Poland is an arduous journey. It requires university study as well as practical exams. I began my journey as assistant coach at monthly National Cups and Club camps for 3 years.\r\nIn 2018 I became head coach in AZS Wratislavia Wroc\u00c5\u0082aw and have been directing all training for senior and junior groups along with private lessons and physical preparation. \r\nAssistant head coach of the national team at national camps and European\/World tournaments \r\nAlthough my specialty lies with giving the tools for the competitive fencer to excel, I am just as happy to train the recreational, as well as beginning fencer no matter if child or veteran.\r\nMy competitive fencing philosophy is that the fencer should learn how to control their body and head in fencing to become a master in this sport. Fencing is one of the best sports because you can win a bout against anyone when you are at your peak and focused to give 100% on the strip without hesitation. \r\n\r\nRecent club results:\r\n2018 to 2022 won National Championships in Epee\r\n2022 our club recorded highest count of medals at National Championship in club history \r\n3 medals at u14 Nationals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 silver boys ind, bronze girls ind, bronze girls team.\r\n3 medals at Cadets Nationals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 silver and bronze boys ind, bronze girls ind\r\n2 medals at Juniors Nationals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 bronze women ind, silver women team\r\n2 medals at U23 Nationals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gold men ind, gold men team (2nd in a row)\r\n5 medals in Senior Nationals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 gold men ind, bronze men ind, bronze women ind, gold men team (5th in a row), silver women team (2nd in a row)\r\n2 medals at Academical National Championships \u00e2\u0080\u0093 silver men ind, bronze women ind.\r\nMaciej Bielec (National Champion in Seniors) had recorded this year his highest start at Senior European Championships \u00e2\u0080\u0093 15th ind and team 8th.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Still Point Fencing","address":"1520 E Broadway Blvd.","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","zip":"85719","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Phoenix","latitude":32.2211711,"longitude":-110.948981,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":46,"name":"Arizona","abbrev":"AZ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":200924,"tournament_id":51615,"tournament":"Clinic with Piotr Nemec ","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Session 1 Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"Session 1","close_of_reg":"2023-07-29T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":200925,"tournament_id":51615,"tournament":"Clinic with Piotr Nemec ","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Session 2 Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"Session 2","close_of_reg":"2023-07-29T13:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":200926,"tournament_id":51615,"tournament":"Clinic with Piotr Nemec ","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Session 3 Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"Session 3","close_of_reg":"2023-07-30T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":200927,"tournament_id":51615,"tournament":"Clinic with Piotr Nemec ","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Session 4 Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"Session 4","close_of_reg":"2023-07-30T13:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":52866,"name":"FCMC Unrated & Open Saber","start_date":"2023-07-30","end_date":"","comments":"SANCTIONED EVENT. \r\nOnly accepting Payment at club (no CC).

He continued to compete in epee while studying in Brussels, finishing 10th in the Belgian Nationals in 1973. He was assistant coach at Lakeland HS in 1988-89. He also ran Fair Lawn's fencing program as head coach for 20 years, retiring in 2016. He has also served as the President of the HS Coaches Association (NJIFA) from 2012-2016. He volunteered his time as a member of the NJ Division's Executive Committee, and also the Tournament Committee. Fencers always saw him at competitions as a referee and\/or armorer all over New Jersey, NY, and New England. He was one of the pioneers of r promoting our sport in high schools throughout the area. In September 2018, Dr. Packer passed away sadly. We will continue to run this tournament in his memory every year to show our appreciation for his hardwork and dedication.\r\n\r\nFEE (paid at the door):\r\n$45 for Freehold Fencing members.\r\n$55 if preregistered on askfred.net\r\n$70 for walk-ins.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT RENTAL FEES:\r\n$10 - Body Cord\/Mask Cord\/Glove\r\n$20 - Any other Equipment (Mask, Lame, Jacket)\r\n$30 - 2 or more pieces of equipment\r\n$45 - Any broken blade\r\n\r\nAll payments made at the door and must be in cash or check only.\r\n**CREDIT CARDS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENTS AT THE DOOR*****\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\nFreehold Fencing Academy is located at:\r\nPoet's Square Mall\r\n56 Thoreau Drive\r\nKozloski Road\r\nFreehold, NJ 07728\r\nTel.: 732-610-0322\r\n\r\nFor any more information visit our website at\r\nhttp:\/\/www.freeholdfencingacademy.com, or e-mail us at freeholdfencing@gmail.com\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/03\/2023.\r\nPreregistration closes on 08\/05\/2023.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Freehold Fencing Academy","address":"56 Thoreau Drive","city":"Freehold","state":"NJ","zip":"07728","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.254692,"longitude":-74.2463377,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":204756,"tournament_id":52704,"tournament":"6th Annual Dr. Eugene Packer Open Epee @ Freehold","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-08-06T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":204757,"tournament_id":52704,"tournament":"6th Annual Dr. Eugene Packer Open Epee @ Freehold","full_name":"Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":0,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-08-06T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":53362,"name":"NJFA - Unrated Mixed Sabre ","start_date":"2023-08-08","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2023-04-19","prereg_close":"2023-08-07","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":20,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"This event is sanctioned by the USFA's NJ Division. \r\n\r\nYou must be born in 2009 or before to compete in this event. \r\n\r\n** If there are more than 6 participants of each gender, separate men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s and women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s events will be held.

Mahvash won gold at the 1973 Asian Games in Tehran at the age of 17! This performance set her up to push for an Olympic qualification, and she did so. After a gold medal in the Asian Olympics in Foil with the Iranian team, Mahvash fenced in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada. After the Olympics, she moved to the United States and studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California. While at USC, Mahvash continued to fence and competed in the 1977 NCAA Championships. She was named MVP of the 1977 season by USC. \r\n\r\nAll fencers must wear required fencing attire and bring at least 2 working weapons and 2 working body cords.\r\n\r\nValid USFA membership is required. You MUST show your USFA card or have proof that you are an Access Member or Competitive member.  You may join at the door, but it is best to arrive with this already done. This can be completed at www.usafencing.org under the Membership tab. \r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.
