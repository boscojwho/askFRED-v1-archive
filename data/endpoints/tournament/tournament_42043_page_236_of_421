Please have separate checks made out to USFA for your USFA membership payment.\r\n\r\nEvent registration is capped at 35 fencers for each event.

Fencers will be pulled in from the wait list in the order that their requests have been received. The current wait list for each event is at the bottom of the page. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for AIF events for the next calendar year. This means that you won\u0092t be able to pre-register via AskFRED and you will have to compete as a walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Men's foil \u0096 9:00 am\r\nSenior Women's foil \u0096 12:00 pm\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/07\/2015.\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by American Institute of Fencing You acknowledge you are entering this tournament at your own risk and release the USFA and its sponsors, American Institute of Fencing, and referees from any liability.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3851  Warren  Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9608254,"longitude":-75.1995622,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113948,"tournament_id":28777,"tournament":"FAP Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-14T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28778,"name":"FAP North Y12 Team Foil","start_date":"2015-03-14","end_date":"","comments":"6 Team Round Robin Unclassified Foil.

Membership is required.  Please join the USFA, if needed, prior to the tournament.\r\n\r\nThis micro-tournament will be conducted on two ungrounded strips within our building.  We have a separate area with cubbies for fencing bags, so the competition floor will not be crowded.  Seating for spectators is limited, but downtown Winter Garden is a wonderful place in which to walk, dine and shop while your fencer is on the strip.  Only essential personnel is recommended :).\r\n\r\nZERO TOLERANCE FOR POOR CONDUCT. This applies to spectators, fencers and coaches.  All referees and administrators deserve respect and patience for doing a tough job.\r\n\r\nMasks and body cords will be checked by the armorer.  Proper fencing attire is required for safety.  \r\n\r\nPayment is required to complete your registration.  The processing fee is non-refundable, unless your event is cancelled.  Any event fees will be promptly refunded if you are unable to attend or fence for any reason.  We all want more low-cost, nearby, and efficient tournaments on the calendar.  Such tournaments require planning, labor and constant attention.  It isn't fair to sign-up and then not show-up.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VENUE IS AWESOME!!\r\n\r\nDowntown Winter Garden is awesome!  Our school is located in the heart and soul of the city.  On Saturdays, there is an award winning farmer's market.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot behind building, enter from Glenside Avenue. We are Suite 201, Building C.  Bring food and drink, their are changing rooms but no showers.  The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0974096,"longitude":-75.1452389,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113951,"tournament_id":28779,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-15T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29041,"name":"Central Florida High School Championship","start_date":"2015-03-15","end_date":"","comments":"Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy is proud to host the first ever High School fencing tournament in the state of Florida.
