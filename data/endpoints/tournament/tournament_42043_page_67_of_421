You can count on well run tournaments and good referees.\r\n\r\nTwelfth Annual Wright Memorial Fencing Tournament Events Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Epee\r\nD & Under Senior Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\nD & Under Senior Mixed Saber\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nRegional Youth Circuit Events Scheduled:\r\nY10 Women's Epee\r\nY10 Women's Foil\r\nY10 Women's Saber\r\nY10 Men's Epee\r\nY10 Men's Foil\r\nY10 Men's Saber\r\nY12 Women's Epee\r\nY12 Women's Foil\r\nY12 Women's Saber\r\nY12 Men's Epee\r\nY12 Men's Foil\r\nY12 Men's Saber\r\nY14 Women's Epee\r\nY14 Women's Foil\r\nY14 Women's Saber\r\nY14 Men's Epee\r\nY14 Men's Foil\r\nY14 Men's Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/27\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/13\/2009.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule\r\n\r\nSaturday, March 14, 2009\r\nOpen Epee -- 9:30 AM\r\nD&Under Epee -- 12:30 PM\r\nOpen Sabre -- 9:30 AM\r\nD&Under Sabre -- 1:00 PM\r\nY14 Sabre 9 AM\r\nY12 Epee 9 AM\r\nY10 Sabre 11 AM\r\nY10 Epee 12 NOON\r\nY12 Sabre 1 PM\r\nY14 Epee 2PM\r\n\r\nSunday, March 15, 2009\r\nOpen Foil -- 9:30 AM\r\nD&Under Foil -- 1:00 PM\r\nY14 Foil 9 AM\r\nY10 Foil 11 AM\r\nY12 Foil 2 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nTimes listed are the close of registration time.

There will be no fence off for third place in any event. \r\n\r\nPre-register online at AskFred.net and look to see who else is coming. Payment can be made upon arrival. Pre-registration closes on March 13, 2009.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current USFA members, and will need to show proof of membership, either by card or by fax from the USFA. (Alternatively, a fencer may be a member in good standing of another National Federation or a current FIE license holder.) You may renew your USFA membership or join at the tournament. Forms will be available at the tournament, or can be downloaded from the USFA website at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org If you do not have your USFA card with you when checking in, you will be required to complete a new USFA form and pay the annual fee. The form and payment will be returned to you upon proof of USFA membership subsequent to the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers must have a parent or guardian signature (not a coach) on their USFA membership form (if renewing or joining at the tournament) and on the tournament entry form.\r\n\r\nMask checks will be performed prior to competition, and there will be weight\/shim tests for all weapons brought onto the fencing strip. You MUST wear a plastron. No sweatpants will be permitted.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules apply. At the end of each bout, fencers are required to sign pool sheets and DE slips before leaving the strip. USFA rules will be enforced throughout the competition.\r\n\r\nFor any USFA competition that is not specifically stated for a certain age category; e.g., Youth or Cadet or Junior or Veterans, the athlete must be at least 13 years old as of January 1 of the fencing season. The fencing season is the same as the membership year, August 1 through the following July 31.  The only exception to this rule is that an athlete under the age of 13 on January 1 of the fencing season, who is on the Junior national point standings, will be allowed to complete in any competition as long as the athlete meets any other criteria required for that competition, e.g., holding a certain classification.  The Birmingham Fencing Club will strictly enforce this rule at all tournaments\r\n\r\nPre-registration is important! This tournament is being held in a facility with room for seven strips, and it may become necessary to limit the number of entries in particular events. Pre-register online at AskFred.net and look to see who else is coming, or register by mail, email or telephone. Payment can be made upon arrival.\r\n\r\nVenue: Birmingham Fencing Club.\r\nFor driving directions, go to http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org\r\nThere are many places to eat nearby.\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble finding the venue on the day of the tournament, call (205)515-3902 or the Club (205)823-4448.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the Birmingham Fencing Club and a full schedule of our tournaments for this season, please visit our website at http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org (not all tournaments have been posted on AskFred.net)\r\n\r\nFOR REGIONAL YOUTH CIRCUIT EVENTS ONLY\r\n\r\nYouth 10 and Youth 12 fencers MUST have fenced in at least one RYC to be eligible to enter any NAC Youth Tournament or Summer Nationals in July 2008\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that there will be separate mens and womens events in each weapon and each age group. Events may be combined into one mixed event if there are fewer than 6 fencers of either gender present at the close of registration.\r\n\r\nY10 fencers must use blades that are no longer than 32.5 inches (i.e., blades that are designated a \"0\" or \"2\" under the internationally recognized lengths). Weapon length will be tested prior to competition. \r\n\r\nTournament format will be pools to five points, used to establish seeding to the direct elimination (DE). DE bouts will be conducted as they are at a NAC. For Y10 and Y12, the winner of the DE bouts is the best 2 out of 3 five-touch bouts. For Y14, the DE bouts are 15 touches (three 3-minute periods, with a 1-minute rest between periods).\r\n\r\nTo fence Y14, you must have been born in 1993-1996, unless you are on the Y12 national point standings. To fence Y12, you must have been born in 1995-1998, unless you are on the Y10 national point standings. To fence Y10, you must have been born in 1997-2000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry Form\r\nName___________________________\r\nClub____________________________\r\nAddress_________________________\r\n________________________________\r\nDivision_________________________ \r\nE-mail___________________________ \r\n\/ \/ Male \/ \/ Female\r\nBirth Date ____________Age________ \r\nUSFA Number_________________\r\n\r\nFoil - rating and year _____\r\nEpee - rating and year_____\r\nSabre - rating and year_____\r\n\r\nEvent (indicate applicable fee): \r\nSenior Mixed Epee   -   $_____\r\nD & Under Senior Mixed Epee -   $_____\r\nSenior Mixed Saber   -   $_____\r\nD & Under Senior Mixed Saber -   $_____\r\nSenior Mixed Foil   -   $_____\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil -   $_____\r\nY10 Mens Foil -   $_____ \r\nY10 Womens Foil - $_____ \r\nY10 Mens Epee -   $_____ \r\nY10 Womens Epee - $_____ \r\nY10 Mens Sabre -  $_____ \r\nY10 Womens Sabre -$_____ \r\nY12 Mens Foil -   $_____ \r\nY12 Womens Foil - $_____ \r\nY12 Mens Epee -   $_____ \r\nY12 Womens Epee - $_____ \r\nY12 Mens Sabre -  $_____ \r\nY12 Womens Sabre -$_____ \r\nY14 Mens Foil -   $_____ \r\nY14 Womens Foil - $_____ \r\nY14 Mens Epee -   $_____ \r\nY14 Womens Epee - $_____ \r\nY14 Mens Sabre -  $_____ \r\nY14 Womens Sabre -$_____ \r\n\r\nTOTAL FEES -      $_____ \r\n\r\n\r\nWaiver\r\nI hereby waive and release all rights and claims for damages I may have against the Birmingham Fencing Club, the United States Fencing Association, the officials, managers, sponsors, and other participants from any and all liabilities arising from illness, losses, injuries or damages I may suffer as a result of my participation in this fencing tournament.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/21\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35933,"tournament_id":8061,"tournament":"Open Sabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":29,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-21T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7841,"name":"Inland Empire Divisionals","start_date":"2009-03-21","end_date":"","comments":"Please join us for the Inland Empire Divisionals.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.
