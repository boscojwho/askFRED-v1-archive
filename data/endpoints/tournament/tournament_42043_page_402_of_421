No cash refunds.\r\n\r\n@@Screaming@@\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/30\/2021\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

He was the founder of the South Texas Division of the Amateur Fencing League of America (AFLA) as USA FENCING was then known. Maitre Pouj also started several fencing clubs in Central Texas and gave fencing lessons at many high schools in Central Texas. The whole of the Poujardieu Family was a driving force for the promotion of fencing for men and women for all of its existence, in their native France and here in their adopting country. After his death in the summer of 1984, it became a memorial, and following the passing of his wife, Louise, and eldest son, Gerard, Jr. (also a fencing master) the tournament became a memorial to a fencing family. Local, regional, national, and international fencers have taken part in this tournament over the years. Highlights have included when Mexican National Teams or Team members have taken part and medaled in most, if not all, of the events, offered. In 2009, the Poujardieu Memorial was one of the first Regional Open Circuit tournaments.\r\n\r\nThe 2022 Poujardieu Memorial Fencing tournament will be held this year on the weekend of October 22-23 2022.\r\n \r\nThe venue is the Henrich Center for Fencing and International Sports on the campus of Saint Anthony Catholic High School, 3200 McCullough Ave. San Antonio, Tx.  78212\r\n\r\nFencing time live :\r\nhttps:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com?t=7183\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMx div1A Foil  Sun 10\/23 11:00 am\r\nMx div2 Foil.
