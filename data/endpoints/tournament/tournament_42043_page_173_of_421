Rules<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n  - wear a fencing jacket, plastron or chest protector, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n  - wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n  - wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n  - wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n  - use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\nMasks with lame bibs are not required for youth events, but an mandatory for cadet events.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":86190,"tournament_id":20985,"tournament":"FAP Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-02-03T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20348,"name":"NJFA Tuesday Unrated Foil","start_date":"2013-02-05","end_date":"","comments":"Close of check-in promptly 6:00!!

The tournaments are open to anyone with birth years 1993 \u0096 99.  Medals will be given at the time of the event to the top three finishers.  Because these are official USFA events, rankings may be earned.  These rankings help with seeding at tournaments in the future and have an overall beneficial effect on an athlete\u0092s fencing career.  In addition, points will be awarded for the top 32 competitors in each event.  Individuals who register for the San Diego Scholastic Fencing Conference will have their results tracked and tabulated for overall SDSFC individual and team awards given at an end of the year banquet.  The registration fee for each individual tournament is $25.00, and all events can be found on AskFred.net\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, teams are ranked and trophies awarded based on the aggregate of points earned by their fencers in all events through the season.  Additionally, in each of the six weapons, the three individuals with highest accumulated points in will earn a trophy.  The conference also has an academic standard.  Your coach will need to verify a \u0093C\u0094 or above GPA for each athlete at the start of the season. \r\n\r\nHigh School 6 Weapon Schedule \r\n$25.00 registration per meet at the door or on AskFred.net:\r\n\r\nBanquet Night \u0096 Day and Location TBA\r\n\r\nEquipment requirements:\r\nJr. Cup events are official USFA tournaments and therefore USFA equipment safety standards must be met.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":86191,"tournament_id":20986,"tournament":"FAP Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":21,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-02-10T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
