The objective is to provide youth (y8, y10, y12 and y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in y8, y10, y12 and\/or y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of escrimeur youth cup points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCalculations\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of points (mxpnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge group     mxpnts\r\n  y8\t       50\r\n  y10\t       50\r\n  y12\t      100\r\n  y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of evntxratio:\r\n\r\nEvntxratio = nentrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((nentrs - pl + 1) \/ nentrs) x mxpnts x evntxratio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned points for escrimeur youth cup series will be a sum of all points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net by midnight on sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net starting monday through midnight on saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks, venmo or zelle for payments made at the door.

He was well-known in the sport of fencing, was a fencing master, and had a tremendous influence on fencing in New York, where he was years ahead of everyone else in the colored uniform trend.  He was a member of the 1948 Olympic saber squad, and in 1952, 1956, and 1960 the Olympic foil squads.   He coached at Salle Santelli, in Westchester high schools, and at CCNY. Among his former students were Tom Ciccarone, Craig Cummings, and Uriah Jones. In 2001 he was inducted into the US Fencing Hall of Fame.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Floyd Little Athletic Center","address":"480 Sherman Pkwy","city":"New Haven","state":"CT","zip":"06511","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.322996,"longitude":-72.9395228,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":197485,"tournament_id":50696,"tournament":"Neil Lazar RYC\/RJCC","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197783,"tournament_id":50696,"tournament":"Neil Lazar RYC\/RJCC","full_name":"Women's Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197784,"tournament_id":50696,"tournament":"Neil Lazar RYC\/RJCC","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197785,"tournament_id":50696,"tournament":"Neil Lazar RYC\/RJCC","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197786,"tournament_id":50696,"tournament":"Neil Lazar RYC\/RJCC","full_name":"Men's Saber","short_name":"MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197787,"tournament_id":50696,"tournament":"Neil Lazar RYC\/RJCC","full_name":"Women's Saber","short_name":"WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50989,"name":"5th Annual Connor Porter Memorial Tournament","start_date":"2022-11-05","end_date":"","comments":"Orlando Fencing Academy invites you to our flagship foil tournament.
