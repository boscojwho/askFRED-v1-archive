The last tournament, held to kickoff the 2007-2008 Season, was a foil event.  \r\n\r\nThe bribes accepted that year included payments to force one's opponent to:\r\n\r\n1.  fence using his opposite hand\r\n2.  fence with an eyepatch on one eye\r\n3.  fence without being able to parry\r\n4.  fence without being able to advance on the strip\r\n5.  fence with wrist weights on his\/her fencing arm or leg\r\n6.  fence while singing\r\n7.  fence while wearing a sabre lame and\/or sabre mask\r\n8.  fence while wearing a t-shirt with holes over the lame\r\n9.  fence wearing someone else's prescription sunglasses\r\n\r\nThe Godfather also had on his payroll a \"hitman\" who could be hired out to fence in the place of a competitor in a bout.  A hitman might be available this year.\r\n\r\nThe Godfather also sold \"reverse the curse\" coupons which allowed a fencer to turn the bribes paid for against him back on the fencer who purchased them in the first place.  (WARNING:  That was a very expensive bribe and will be so again if used this year.)\r\n\r\nMany of the bribes were specific as to foil last time.  This year, competitors need to formulate their bribes with an eye toward maximizing their effect in an epee bout.\r\n\r\nWE WILL HAVE SOME VERY SPECIAL AWARDS in a variety of categories for the winners (and maybe the losers too).\r\n\r\nAFTER THE TOURNAMENT - Bring your picnic lunches and we will all retire with our families and friends to Memorial Park for fun and fellowship.

Any player defeated in the elimination round will fall into a second NON-USFA bracket and fence a second Elimanation round.  Thus they will be a \"Zombie\" fencer.  At the end of both elimination rounds the winners of the the two eliminations will face off.  In the past this has been fairly unpredictable as far as the winner, but will not affect USFA ratings.\r\n\r\nZombie themed prizes to be announced.\r\n\r\nRegistration ends at 9am the morning of the tournament.  $30 preregistration by July 27, 2011.  $40 morning of tournament.

Once the team event is over, the members of the winning team will then fence each other 5 touches for the medals. This event will have just as much, and perhaps more fencing than a normal open. You will make new friends for you have no idea who will be on your team.
