Competitors regularly attend from up and down the East Coast and are always welcome.\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\u00e2\u0080\u00a8 The Cup was interrupted during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons by COVID-19 and we are planning to host a complete Cup series this season. The organizers understand the concerns that many fencers will have regarding health and safety protocols . For this reason, the organizers have communicated an expectation to each club hosting an event that they will meet or exceed the standard set for NACs (masking at all times and proof of vaccination) in addition to complying with all local laws. While the organizers will attempt to provide updates via social media, given the speed with which policies can change, the most definitive information regarding health and safety protocols will always be found by calling the club hosting the event.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\u00e2\u0080\u00a8HOW WILL THE CUP WINNER DETERMINED?\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8In addition to individual event awards, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2021-2022 Cup Standings at the end of the season will be recognized.

Each fencer will get credit for points earned at up to three 2021-2022 Cup events (assuming the currently anticipated five events; if a sixth event is added, points can be earned at up to four events)\r\n\r\n2. For each 2021-2022 Cup event, fencers will receive points based on their finish and letter ratings of other participants who finish below them: \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8<ul>a. Each fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8b. Fencers will earn points equal to the sum of the point values of all fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8c.
