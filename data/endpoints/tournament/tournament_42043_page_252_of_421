Warm-up \r\npants are not allowed. Fencing glove must \r\ncover the lower half of the forearm. Tape \r\ncovering holes on gloves is not permitted. \r\n\r\n*Plastrons (underarm protectors): \r\nStandard fencing plastron; required with every \r\nuniform \r\n\r\n*Chest Protector: \r\nRequired for females \r\n\r\n*Masks: \r\n12K punch test; sewn in bib visual inspection - \r\ncannot have any rips, tears or holes in the bib; \r\nall rivets must be installed; covering over the \r\nwelds must be present and installed so it will \r\nnot catch a blade. Conductive Bib in foil is \r\nrequired; retrofit conductive bibs must be \r\ninstalled such that they will not catch a blade; \r\nthey shall be tested for conductivity of 5 ohms \r\nor less with no dead areas; tabs are not \r\nrequired; if tabs are present, they must be \r\nconductive - if not they must be removed. \r\nElastic strap at back of mask is required and \r\nmust be tight enough to prevent the mask from \r\nfalling off. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n*Blades: \r\nFor The maximum blade length permitted for \r\nY10 competitions is 32.5 inches. This \r\nrequirement must be strictly enforced.

For \r\nexample, if there are 17 fencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8. Only the top 6 finishers, not the \r\ntop 7 finishers, earn points. Athletes finishing in the top 40% of their event at an SYC earn \r\nNational Ranking points in that category. In Y12 and Y14 this qualifies athletes to compete at \r\nthe Summer National Championships for the season in which they earned national points. For \r\nY10, athletes qualify to compete at the Summer National Championships by participating in an \r\nRYC or SYC tournament within the competitive season. Only one\/the highest SYC result in a \r\ngiven category is counted towards an athlete\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds National Ranking. SYC points are awarded at a \r\n0.8 scale of the Youth NAC points table. (New 2015-2016) \r\n==============================================================================\r\n\r\nRULES OF COMPETITION:\r\n******************************** \r\n \r\n*Tournament Format: The format for all SYC events must be one round of pools with 100% \r\npromoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. All events must use pools of six or seven \r\nwhenever possible. In events with fewer than 11 entrants, the BC may elect to have two rounds \r\nof pools followed by 100% promoted to a DE tableau. There is no fence-off for third place \r\n\r\n*For Y10, direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2-3 minute periods with a 1 minute break \r\nbetween) with the first period ending after 3 minutes or when the score reaches 5 touches on \r\none side, whichever comes first. \r\n \r\n*For Y12 and Y14 events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3- 3 minute periods with a 1 minute \r\nbreak between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a team-\r\nmate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

(The updated USFA membership list is published each Thursday evening.) \r\n\r\nCurrent ratings can be verified here:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Current-Membership-Listing\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n1. Current National Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\n800N Saber Glove Mandatory for All USA Fencing Sanctioned Tournaments Beginning on Oct. 1, 2015\r\n \r\nIn conjunction with the updated amendments to the Federation Internationale d'Escrime Rules, the USA Fencing Board of Directors has voted to mandate that all saber athletes must use a glove that meets the protection requirements listed below in all USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments beginning on Oct. 1, 2015.\r\nThe material of the fencing glove must have a level of protection of 800N on the areas shown in the diagram below, the seams a minimum strength of 200N and cuff a level of protection of 350N. The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n  \r\nThe conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\nIn order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\nThe conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Special Events Recreation Center","address":"SERC

The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n  \r\nThe conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\nIn order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\nThe conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/20\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/22\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Wasatch Fencing","address":"353 Market

The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n  \r\nThe conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\nIn order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\nThe conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n ","venue":{"name":"Henry Crown Sports Pavillion, Northwestern Univ","address":"2311 N.

This tournament is held in honor of Ryder Darwin, a founding member of our club who tragically lost his life at the age of 21.  He was a 3 time national medalist, a beloved friend, and drawn to fencing for the personal challenges offered to him by participation in our sport. This event began in 2014 as a way to honor his life and we are proud to offer the 2015 Ryder Cup as part of the Regional Cadet Junior Circuit. \r\n\r\nJeff Kallio & Jennifer Oldham\r\nMid-South Fencers' Club\r\nDurham, NC\r\ninfo@midsouthfencersclub.org\r\n(919)-286-3100\r\n","venue":{"name":"Mid-South Fencers Club","address":"121 North Gregson Street","city":"Durham","state":"NC","zip":"27701","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":36.004307,"longitude":-78.875467,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":59,"name":"North Carolina","abbrev":"NC","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":121771,"tournament_id":30913,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC (Region 6)","full_name":"Cadet Women's Saber","short_name":"CdWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-24T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":121772,"tournament_id":30913,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC (Region 6)","full_name":"Cadet Men's Saber","short_name":"CdMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":16,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-24T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":121776,"tournament_id":30913,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC (Region 6)","full_name":"Junior Women's Saber","short_name":"JrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-25T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":121777,"tournament_id":30913,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC (Region 6)","full_name":"Junior Men's Saber","short_name":"JrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":20,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-25T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":31443,"name":"2015 Virginia Division Junior Olympic Qualifiers","start_date":"2015-10-24","end_date":"2015-10-25","comments":"This is the 2015 Virginia Division qualifier tourney to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics for FOIL and EPEE ONLY, and is also the VA DIV Junior and Cadet Championship event. $35 if you're registered here, $70 if you're not.","prereg_open":"2015-09-16","prereg_close":"2015-10-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is the 2015 Virginia Division qualifier tourney to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics for FOIL and EPEE ONLY, and is also the VA DIV Junior and Cadet Championship event. $35 per event if registered on AskFred, $70 per event if not.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Epee\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Foil\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Epee\r\nJunior (U20) Men's Foil\r\n\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) Women's Foil\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) Men's Foil\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\nJunior (U20) events will be held before the Cadet events on the same day.\r\n\r\nVA Division Members Only!!!

However, any RYC held before the March NAC but AFTER the deadline for entry will NOT be considered for qualification to this tournament.\r\n\r\n2) The Y10 and Y12 events at SN this season will be National Championships. The Y10 path remains participation in an RYC = qualification. For Y12, the RYC path is the top 50% of the fencers on their Regions point standings will qualify. Foreign Fencers will be skipped and the next eligible fencer will qualify as these events are now National Championships. The SYC\/NAC NRPS points path remains the same.\r\n\r\n3) The winner of a Y14 RYC will NO longer earn automatic qualification to SNs. Rather, at the end of the season, the top 25% on each region's list will qualify.

To compete fencers must be unclassified in the particular event they fence.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally there will be a non-USFA <b><i>Novice<\/i><\/b> competition for those who have been <b><i>fencing less than one year<\/i><\/b>. Please see separate details for the novice event below:\r\n\r\nFor the USFA competitions, all USFA rules will apply. Masks, bodycords and lames will be checked at the armory before competition.\r\n\r\n<b>Waiver:<\/b>\r\nAll competitors must submit a copy of the Gulf Coast Division waiver of liability and consent to treat form. Copies will be available at the venue. You can also download and print your own: https:\/\/app.box.com\/s\/j8a12ltuhjrckczgj8bk\r\n\r\nFencers under age 18 must have a <b><i>parent's signature<\/i><\/b> on this form.\r\n\r\n<b>USFA\/US Fencing Membership:<\/b>\r\nCurrent competitive membership of the USFA required <b>(except for Novice events)<\/b>.

This does NOT mean you may fence novice if, for example, you have been fencing epee for years but never picked up a foil until now. This is for NEW FENCERS. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up for novice, you should expect I will be checking your name against past years of USFA membership and FRED results.\r\n\r\nThe novice events MAY be divided into two events at the time of the tournament based upon the ages of the competitors and at the discretion of tournament organizers.\r\n\r\nNovice foil competitions will NOT require the masks with the competition\/lame' bibs. The OLD bibs (the kind epee fencers still use) will be allowed.\r\n\r\nGFC has a limited number of lame's available. If we have one in your size you can rent one for $20.00.

Being a tourist town, Galveston hotels run the gamut. Of really nice hotels close to the venue there are two that jump out:\r\n \r\nThe Tremont House \r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSTH\/main.wnt?cid=14807\r\n \r\nThe Hotel Galvez\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSHG\/main.wnt?cid=14749\r\n \r\nBoth are \"historic\" hotels operated by Wyndham. Tremont is in the Historic Strand District. The Galvez is on the beach. Neither is quite five minutes from the venue.\r\n \r\nFurther down Seawall Blvd, facing the Gulf of Mexico are three hotels, side by side, offering different price points, as they say. All three face the sea. Most of your drive to the venue would be along Seawall Blvd. from either of these three. It can be a bit busy on a weekend, but you do have the Gulf of Mexico on the right side pretty much 90%\r\nof the way, which can make up for it. In \"high traffic times\" allow fifteen minutes to reach the venue.\r\n \r\nThe San Luis http:\/\/www.sanluisresort.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Hilton http:\/\/www.galvestonhilton.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Holiday Inn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/holidayinnresorts\/hotels\/us\/en\/galveston\/glssb\/hoteldetail\r\n \r\nOne other option that is different but might be fun is Harbor House,which is located along the Galveston Waterfront (near the cruise ship terminals and the waterfront restaurants).\r\nhttp:\/\/www.harborhousepier21.com\/ \r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on
