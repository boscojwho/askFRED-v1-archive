During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2006-2009) and Senior (2005 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n5:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it's ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior: can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries x place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates and prize themes for the 2018-2019 events:\r\n#1 August 25, 2018, National Dog Day\r\n#2 October 27, 2018, National Chocolate Day\r\n#3 January 5, 2019, CANCELED\r\n#4 March 2, 2019, National Frozen Foods Day\r\n#5 May 18, 2019, National Science Fiction Day\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\n**Each event costs $20, payable at the door (in cash, please).**\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact Jade Calvert at j.calvert@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"7601 Boulevard 26, Ste. 131","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8315632,"longitude":-97.22008,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":162968,"tournament_id":41042,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #5","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-18T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162969,"tournament_id":41042,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #5","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-18T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162970,"tournament_id":41042,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #5","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-18T17:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41302,"name":"Open Mixed Aged Teams & Y12 Open","start_date":"2019-05-18","end_date":"","comments":"USFA membership not required but recommended.This will be a stand sit tournament.\r\nUSFA rules will apply.\r\nWalk ins are welcomed but you gatta see da Special Man!","prereg_open":"2018-08-22","prereg_close":"2019-05-17","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":15,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"All USA rules apply\r\n\r\nUSFA club membership is the minimum requirement.\r\n \r\nA team will consist of three fencers in one weapon.\r\nWheel chair fencers are welcomed to fence.

Chest protectors and athletic cups are suggested for athletes. Full equipment is needed to fence: Mask, jacket, pants, knee length socks, sous-plastron, and glove. Any equipment deemed unsafe by the organizers will be disallowed.  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSaturday the 18th  of May  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9:00: Cadet Boys Epee and Cadet Girls Epee  \r\n\r\nNoon: Open Men Epee and Open Women Epee  \r\n\r\nFollowing the Open we will have a Mixed Veteran Epee \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSunday the 19th  of May  \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n9:00 Y10 Boys Epee and Y10 Girls Epee  \r\n\r\n11:30 Y12 Boys Epee and Y12 Girls Epee  \r\n\r\n2:30 Y14 Boys Epee and Y14 Girls Epee ","venue":{"name":"Beairsto Elementary School","address":"3302 27th St.","city":"Vernon","state":"BC","zip":"V1T4W7","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":50.2666147,"longitude":-119.2671617,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":165872,"tournament_id":41685,"tournament":"Jeux de Pomme 2019 - CFF sanctioned events","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-19T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165874,"tournament_id":41685,"tournament":"Jeux de Pomme 2019 - CFF sanctioned events","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-19T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165876,"tournament_id":41685,"tournament":"Jeux de Pomme 2019 - CFF sanctioned events","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Epee","short_name":"CdMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":9,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-18T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165878,"tournament_id":41685,"tournament":"Jeux de Pomme 2019 - CFF sanctioned events","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":17,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-18T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":165879,"tournament_id":41685,"tournament":"Jeux de Pomme 2019 - CFF sanctioned events","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Epee","short_name":"VCmMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-18T15:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":173573,"tournament_id":41685,"tournament":"Jeux de Pomme 2019 - CFF sanctioned events","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":43740,"name":"D Under Saber","start_date":"2019-05-18","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for a D and under Saber tournament!

Herb won hundreds of medals, qualifying for the USA Fencing National Championships 61 times. While Spector fenced all three weapons over the course of his career, saber was his favorite, claiming 22 veteran saber age category titles and three veteran open saber championships.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the Birmingham Fencing Club, please visit our website at http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org\r\n\r\nPlease direct tournament questions to birminghamfencingclubal@gmail.com \r\n\r\nGo to http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org\/contact for a map to our new location.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nMIXED SENIOR FOIL:  10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Lindy was battling cancer and passed away on April 9th, 2019. Over the many years, Lindy became a devoted friend and supporter of Down East School of Fencing: often helping with fencing classes and refereeing; a regular at fencing tournaments; and volunteering to assist younger fencers to learn. Lindy was a fine veteran fencer; devoted to the mastery of his fencing. His presence always made our fencing club wonderful and fun. He was man of great sincerity and integrity. Our thoughts go out to his family. We will miss you Lindy here at DESF.

Y14 and above fencers can fence in both!  Both events have a maximum registration of 30 fencers due to our space limitations.  Sign up early to reserve your spot!\r\n\r\nRegistration fees are by donation, with a suggested donation of $35 per event.\r\n\r\n10 AM \u00e2\u0080\u0093 SHARK n MINNOWS\r\nThis is an unsanctioned event.  It is great for ALL ages and abilities, including youth and beginners.  Come test your skills and find out\u00e2\u0080\u00a6are you a SHARK or a MINNOW?  The wonderful part of this format is that young beginners can fence older and more experienced fencers.  They can get good practice, encouragement, and excellent tips.  And the top fencers who do well in the first round get to fight among themselves in the sharks pool which is also good experience and lots of fun.  The minnows get more equal fencing the second round of pools.  Generally the event will last a bit less than 4 hours with two rounds of pools.  And if we are able to get pools of 6 fencers for each round that is 10 bouts per participant!\r\n\r\n2 PM \u00e2\u0080\u0093 SENIOR MIXED FOIL\r\nThis is a Sanctioned Mixed Foil event.  You must be born in 2005 or earlier to participate or be on the Junior national points list.  All fencers must hold a current USA Fencing Competitive Membership.  Ratings CAN be earned in this event.  Format is traditional pools followed by 100% promotion into direct eliminations.  Standard USA Fencing rules apply including electric bibs, foils that pass the weight test, and all the usual safety equipment.\r\n\r\nMORE INFORMATION FOR SHARKS N MINNOWS\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate in the sharks n minnows event due to liability requirements. This event is not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. You cannot earn any national points. But maybe if you are good or lucky you can go next door to the boba shop. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen 'cause it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nThis is a mixed gender, mixed age event for the mixed sharks n minnows event.  There is the traditional first round of pools with seeded fencers separated. So each pool will have pretty experienced fencers mixed in with beginners. Those who do the best in the first round (the sharks) will be put together for the second round of pools. And everyone else (the minnows) will also have a second round among themselves. That way the sharks can beat each other up. And the minnows can have a more even chance to be the biggest guppy. We will likely have the top TWO sharks fence a showcase finals.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES\r\nWe have room for 30 total fencers in each event. You snooze, you lose. So just click the \"Preregister\" button right now.\r\n\r\nWe have equipment available to rent for $15 (MTFC Members no charge). If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nWe hope you can join us and help support Keyon!\r\n\r\nIf you like to donate to our fundraiser please click on \"e-mail the organizer\" and get in touch.  We welcome all the support we can get.
