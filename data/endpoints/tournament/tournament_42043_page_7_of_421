We will, however, accept cash in US funds at par at the registration table. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nHere's a map of UBC: http:\/\/www.ubc.ca\/about\/ubcmap.pdf\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C\/D-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] in the map.\r\n\r\nThere's a parkade north of it, or you can park in the open air parkade between Gate 1 & Gate 2 [at C\/D 5].\r\n\r\nDid you come to the PBI? The Peter Bakonyi International?\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building between the two gyms we used on the left if you were going form the War Memorial Gym to the other gym.\r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry, or the border after Oak St Bridge,\r\n\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive or\r\n\r\nOption B: follow Oak St all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Ave (at the bottom of the UBC map) that's the first and only exit on the right clost to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights - don't run the red lights, ok?\r\n\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it's a bit far away from the SUB. IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old busloop (labeled bus loop construction on the map) there is parking there right in front of the SUB.\r\nI think the rate is $3.50 for the whole day.\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediate,y north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you're in, pass the tall highrises of Gage Towers.\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C\/D 4\/5 on the map.\r\nSorry, I don't know the all-day rate there.\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE..\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north. there will be signs)\r\n\r\nIt's fairly easy to find.","venue":{"name":"UBC, Vancouver, BC","address":"","city":"","state":"","zip":"","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":3716,"tournament_id":910,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2005","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":3718,"tournament_id":910,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2005","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":24,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":3719,"tournament_id":910,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2005","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":24,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":3720,"tournament_id":910,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2005","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":925,"name":"North Carolina Divisionals","start_date":"2005-04-02","end_date":"2005-04-03","comments":"Cost: $10 registration plus $15\/event (preregister and prepay) or $20\/event (on-site registration).

This one time could include the same day on which the team event occurs.  Individuals do not qualify for teams, clubs qualify for teams with the potential for individual fencers who represent the club at nationals to be completely different from those who represent the club at the qualifier.  Five clubs are allowed to qualify without fencing, therefore, if less than 6 clubs compete, all qualify and no fencing will occur.  To help defray trophy costs, no trophies will be given to non-contested events.  Team events are seeded according to how that fencer finished in the open event of the same weapon.   No division patches are given for team events, but will be awarded for non-contested events.  For further information, please check the complete rules for qualifiers in the electronic news sent to each USFA member or the confirmation materials included with registration for national events, or contact the division secretary.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Shreveport,

The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any \"harder\" than any other local tournaments. The top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify, so the more fencers that show up, the more people qualify.\r\n\r\nThis event will be fenced using the new scoring box timings in foil and saber.\r\n\r\nFor compete info, see www.wwdfencing.org\/Events\/Divisionals.php\r\n\r\n------- ALL EVENTS NOW A FLAT $5!  --------\r\n\r\nIn order to encourage turnout, we have decided to reduce the entry fee for this tournament to a flat $5 per event.
