Other competitive opportunities in the ROC tournaments are provided for Veteran (40 & Older) and Division II (C, D, E or U) fencers. ROC tournaments are open to current USA Fencing competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses. However, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USA Fencing National Championship events. In the event that a foreign fencer finishes within the qualifying group, the foreign fencer will be skipped and only the highest-finishing eligible domestic fencers will qualify. \r\nIn each ROC category (Division I-A, Division II, and Veterans) competitions will award points to the top 40% of the competitive field (rounded up to the next higher integer) to a maximum of 64th place, using the point tables for regional competitions found in The Athlete's Handbook Appendix 2.5. Only the best 3 results, in each respective category, count towards the point total. These points may qualify D1A, DV2, and Veteran ROC fencers to the USA Fencing National Championships in D1A, DV2, DV3, and Veteran. The ROC point standings are not used for seeding National level tournaments. Only ROC events award regional ranking points.\r\n\r\n- Entry is determined by 2017-18 USA Fencing birth year requirements and rating restrictions: \r\nDiv I-A (any rating): Born 2004 or before, or on the Junior National Rolling Points List \r\nDiv2 (C,D,E or U rating): Born 2004 or before\r\n\r\n==============================\r\nTOURNAMENT STAFF\r\n==============================\r\nChief Organizer: Robert Piraino\r\nAsst.

Armorer will be on-site for repairs (for fee). Fencers only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the ROC\r\n- Full USA Fencing regulation uniform required. Name is NOT required on uniform. Foil mask with conductive bib required. Fencers arm, equip and clothe themselves and fence at their own responsibility and at their own risk. Fencers are responsible for ensuring arrival at the strip with working equipment.\r\n\r\nREQUIRED EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n- Uniforms (jacket, pants, knee-high socks, fencing glove): Standard fencing uniforms; cannot have any rips, tear, or holes. Warm-up pants or jeans are not allowed. Fencing glove must cover half of the forearm. 800N Saber Glove is Mandatory. Holes in gloves (all weapons) are not allowed. Worn-through top surface in an area subject to being hit by your opponents will not be allowed. Glue is an acceptable repair. Tape covering holes is not acceptable.\r\n- Plastrons (underarm protectors): Standard fencing plastron; required with every uniform \r\n- Chest Protector: Required for females \r\n- Masks: 12K punch test; sewn in bib. Conductive Bib in foil is required Mask Elastic Safety Straps: beginning this season, these will be checked during equipment check to ensure that they are serviceable and in good condition. Worn, loose or stretched out straps will be cause for a mask to be rejected. Foil Masks with the Velcro attached bib: There is a concern that a blade sliding down the mask can get caught in the Velcro and break. If an Armorer determines that there is a significant risk of a tip being caught, the mask will be rejected. This can be repaired by the official repair vendor, who can sew it down in a way that the bib can be replaced. Leon Paul Safety Straps: When the mask is presented for inspection, it is acceptable to have a mask with the fasteners for the strap without the strap being installed. If the strap is installed, both parts must be present and working. When on the strip, if the strap is attached, it MUST to be used.\r\n- Weapons:  Use of Solder lugs and shrinkwrap to Terminate Weapon Wires. The US SEMI has determined that this method of connecting weapon wires to the socket violates the rules, and therefore is not an accepted practice. Referees have been informed to reject weapons using this method of connection, and can result in appropriate penalties.\r\n- Blades: Standard blade length of 30-35 inches permitted. Must have at least two working weapons and two body cords when reporting to the strip.\r\n- Weapon Handle: Any attachment to a weapon's handle must fix the hand in one position such that the top of the thumb is no more than 2 cm from the inner surface of the guard. \r\n- Names on Uniforms: Not required.\r\n\r\n- Ratings can be awarded if criteria met. See USFA ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0103\/2516\/2016-2017_Athlete_Handbook_12.16.16.pdf.- page 137)\r\n\r\nSEEDING\r\n\r\nThe format for all ROC events is one round of pools maximized to 6 and 7 fencers as possible, with 100% promoted to a direct elimination table. Fencers from the same club will be separated as much as possible in the first round of competition. \r\n\r\nOnly ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings posted on FRED are not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. \r\n\r\nCurrent ratings: https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members . Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n\r\nDV1A: \r\n1. Current Senior national rolling point standings regardless of classification \r\n2. Classification and year \r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors. \r\n\r\nDVII\r\n1. Classification and year \r\n2. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors. \r\n\r\nVET\r\n1. \r\n\r\nFORMAT\r\n- One preliminary round of pools (5-touch\/3 minute bouts), then all fencers advance to direct elimination round (15 touch\/9-minute bouts.). DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Fencers are seeded by their results in the pool round wherein the results of fencers in all the pools are ordered by best results to poorest results: highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n- There is no fence-off for third place.\r\n- Medals awarded to Top 8. \r\n\r\n- Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n- Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL DURING TOURNAMENT:\r\n- Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n- Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\nSPECTATORS:\r\n\r\nEverybody taking part in or present at a fencing competition must remain orderly and must not disturb the smooth running of the competition. At no time is anyone allowed to criticize the Officials or their decisions, to insult them or to attempt to influence them in any way. Coaches and spectators are allowed to give advice to fencers, but in all situations, coaches and spectators must not disturb the order of the bout. The referee and\/or the Bout Committee can decide to expel from the competition venue, with or without warning, any person who by gesture, attitude or language disturbs the good order or smooth running of the tournament. \r\n\r\n==============================\r\nEQUIPMENT CHECK\r\n==============================\r\n\r\nArrive early to allow time for equipment check.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 12:00 PM (NOON) check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well.

Please check the events calendar for more tournament dates.\r\n\r\nRJCC tournaments are open to current USA Fencing competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving the results, the National Office will send an online survey to all participants requesting their feedback.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Fees<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration and payment is through AskFred.\r\nThere are no refunds after 03\/30\/2018, NO EXCEPTIONS.\r\n\r\nEarly bird registration period ends at 11:59pm on 03\/23\/2018.\r\nRegistration fee: $30 Event fee: $40\r\n\r\nRegular fee registration period ends at 11:59pm on 03\/30\/2018.\r\nRegistration fee: $60 Event fee: $80\r\n\r\nLate fee registration period ends at 11:59pm on 04\/06\/2018.\r\nRegistration fee: $90 Event fee: $120\r\n\r\nRegistration at the door will be double fees + $200 cash or check only.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>How to earn Regional Points<\/b>\r\n\r\nPlease refer to Chapter 3 of the Athlete Handbook for more details on points. \r\n\r\nThe Regional Junior\/Cadet Circuit (RJCC) is designed to promote and develop strong regional tournaments for Junior and Cadet aged fencers who seek competitive opportunities beyond the local and divisional level but below the NAC Junior\/Cadet levels.\r\n\r\nFencers only earn points at RJCCs within their home region (your Region is assigned based on Division affiliation). Only the best 2 results count towards the point total. These points may qualify Cadet and Junior fencers to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and July Challenge. Points earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of national point standings; they are only reflected in regional point standings. \r\n\r\nUsing the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants:\r\n\r\n((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points\r\n\r\nThe winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of region. Regional RJCC Points are only earned in the fencers own region.\r\n\r\nRJCCs must have at least 2 competitors and cannot be fenced with mixed gender.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to the July Challenge from the Junior RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\nEarn 65 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to the July Challenge from the Cadet RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\nEarn 65 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline\r\n\r\nEarn 65 Cadet Regional Points composed by the regular entry fee deadline\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Notes<\/b>\r\n\r\nPoints earned from August 2017-May 2018 will count toward qualification (as long as the fencer is still age eligible)\r\n\r\nRegional Points are composed of a fencers top 2 point finishes within the fencer's region\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information about the RJCC:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjcc-resources\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Seeding<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating and points standing are correct with the USFA, and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament.\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined USFA Letter Ranking with year classification. Athletes of the same classification\/year will be seeded randomly within their criteria. \r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit https:\/\/www.usfencing.org\r\n\r\nPlease note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2003-2006\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=38281\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/06\/2018\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
