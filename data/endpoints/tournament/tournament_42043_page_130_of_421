Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":68269,"tournament_id":16066,"tournament":"Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-09-18T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15847,"name":"Manassas Youth Tournament","start_date":"2011-09-18","end_date":"","comments":"We will offer both mens and women\u0092s event in all categories of Y10\/Y12\/Y14 Foil and Epee.

A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still\r\nparticipating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we\r\nwill show you). US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is not required as these are not sanctioned\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nEntry Fee\r\n\r\nThe basic entry fee is $5 per fencer per event. Electric equipment rental is $10 per event.\r\n\r\nElectric Equipment\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to\r\narrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you\r\nwill need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through\r\nan electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing.\r\n\r\nTournament Format\r\n\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with a round of pools and 100% promotion to direct eliminations. The\r\nrounds will be self-directed. Because this will be a mixed tournament with combined youth and adult\r\nfencers, direct elimination will be a standard 15 point, 3 period format unless either of the fencers in\r\na direct elimination bout is 12 years old or younger in which case the format will be best 2 out of 3, 5\r\npoint bouts as is standard for all 12 and under events. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/06\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/22\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"MTFC","address":"1106 S. 15th St","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","zip":"98405","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":66352,"tournament_id":15628,"tournament":"MTFC In-house Tournament #2:  Foil","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":24,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-09-23T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
