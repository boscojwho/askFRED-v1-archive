If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list using the link in your confirmation email. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>$60 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 9\/6\/17.

If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up.

If your membership card says \"Verified: Y\", that is sufficient proof.   Else, you will need a passport or copy of a birth certificate, or other government issued ID.  A cell phone photo of those will also work.  Tournament organizers are supposed to send verified birth date info to US Fencing , but you can send a photo of an acceptable document to  info@usfencing.org with the fencer's name and member number, they will update their records, and you can then print out an updated membership card.\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nImportant tournament information, including any close of check-in time changes, will be communicated through the askFRED e-mail system.

To participate in the Y10, Y12 and Y14 Summer National events, fencers must qualify.  Y10 and Y12 fencers must also qualify for the Youth NAC.  RYCs serve as a qualifying path for both tournaments.\r\n\r\nA Y12 or Y14 fencer's top three Regional point scores from RYCs in the fencers Region are added up. Utah-Southern Idaho Division clubs will host three RYCs. If all three are not fenced, your kids are at a significant disadvantage to kids from other states in our region or will have to travel out of state to fence three RYCs and be competitive with fencers who do.\r\n\r\nFencers from outside of Utah should be aware that the Utah-Southern Idaho Division is quite small and that this is exacerbated by the fact that our Southern Idaho clubs are not in Region 4. As a result, our RYCs are all small and despite our best efforts to dragoon fencers and schedule men's and women's events so they can be combined at the last moment, some events are likely to be canceled for lack of two participants. Accordingly, we are requiring that all pre-registrations be approved. This will be automatic for local fencers, but we want to communicate with out of state fencers to clarify and coordinate the risks - so email us.  We close online askFRED registration a week before the event, but bout committee will be able to add registrants up to the event start time for events with only one registered fencer.\r\n\r\nThat being said, come play!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Utah Swords Academy Fencing Club","address":"3536 S West Temple","city":"South Salt

Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet, he\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\n-\tThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events.

USFA rules govern all events. Fencers must have current USFA competitive membership and all required protective equipment.\r\n\r\n***Age categories***\r\n-Senior events: for fencers born 2004 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n***Registration fees***\r\n$35 FOR 1 EVENT \r\n$10 EXTRA FOR THOSE WHO REGISTER AT THE DOOR.\r\n\r\nSpecial for college fencers from recognized collegiate teams: $25 first event if paid in advance: contact Bout Committee to get the discount. \r\n\r\n***Tournament Location***\r\n\r\nLiberty Fencing Club is located at 366 Easton Road, Warrington, PA 18976, between County Line Road and Street Road (on Route 611 across the street from Target & Lowe's). Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597 or Bout Committee at 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\n***Payment information***\r\n\r\nREVISED NO-SHOW POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nC & Under Mixed Epee\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/12\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/16\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":149948,"tournament_id":37781,"tournament":"Liberty Div2 Epee","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-09-17T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":37539,"name":"September MUS Open (Referee Exam)","start_date":"2017-09-17","end_date":"","comments":"Mary Mahon Referee Practical Exam will be held during the tournament.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED FOIL: 9:30 AM check-in (closes)\r\nMIXED EPEE: 1:30 PM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
