The Peter Bakonyi International?\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building between the two gyms we used on the left if you were going form the War Memorial Gym to the other gym.\r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry, or the border after Oak St Bridge,\r\n\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive or\r\n\r\nOption B: follow Oak St all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Ave (at the bottom of the UBC map) that's the first and only exit on the right clost to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights - don't run the red lights, ok?\r\n\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it's a bit far away from the SUB. IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old busloop (labeled bus loop construction on the map) there is parking there right in front of the SUB.\r\nI think the rate is $3.50 for the whole day.\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediate,y north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you're in, pass the tall highrises of Gage Towers.\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C\/D 4\/5 on the map.\r\nSorry, I don't know the all-day rate there.\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building NORTHWGmail - Compose MailEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE..\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north. there will be signs)\r\n\r\nIt's fairly easy to find.","venue":{"name":"UBC SUB Ballroom","address":"","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":8137,"tournament_id":1815,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2006","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":21,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-03-25T09:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":8139,"tournament_id":1815,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2006","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-03-25T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":8140,"tournament_id":1815,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2006","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-03-25T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":8726,"tournament_id":1815,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament 2006","full_name":"Junior Mixed Saber","short_name":"JrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":18,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-03-25T08:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":1570,"name":"Blue Grass State Games","start_date":"2006-03-25","end_date":"","comments":"Tournament Fees: TBD.

If you are interested in competing in this tournament, you must meet all age and citizenship qualification requirements, as well as qualify through your Division if you are not an automatic qualifier.  This means that if more than 3 fencers from the Alabama Division are interested in qualifying to compete in the same event (e.g., Under 16 Women\u0092s Sabre) at Summer Nationals, then a qualifying competition must be held at the Division level.\r\n\r\nWe will be qualifying men and women for all 3 weapons in Under 16 and Youth 14 age groups, and for Div. II and Div. III events.\r\n\r\nWe will also qualify men\u0092s and women\u0092s Division I, Senior and Junior teams for each weapon.  If you are interested in team fencing, you will need to complete a team registration form to register for that event with your club name and the names of the team members and alternates.  \r\n\r\nThe top 25% of the competitors at the qualifying tournament (no fewer than 3) will be eligible to compete in the Summer Nationals competition.  If it is necessary to hold a qualifying event for the Alabama Division, it will be held on Sunday, April 2, 2006.  The cost to register is $25.00 for the first individual event and $10.00 for each additional individual event and $25 for each team event.  The tournament will be held at the Birmingham Fencing Club, 1425 Montgomery Hwy., Ste. 25, Birmingham, Alabama 35216.  Directions to the Birmingham Fencing Club can be found on the club website at http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org.\r\n\r\nComplete details concerning the qualification procedure and requirements for fencing at Summer Nationals are set forth in the 2005-2006 Athlete Handbook, the full text of which is available on the USFA website at www.usfencing.org.\r\n\r\nYou must register by March 30, 2006 in order to compete in this competition.  This deadline applies to both individual and team registrations.  Your entry form and payment must be received by the Alabama Division Secretary no later than March 30, 2006.  You may register on AskFred.net.  However, your registration on AskFred.net is not complete until you have mailed your entry form and payment to Carol Gray Caldwell, Alabama Division Secretary, 985 Valley View Road, Indian Springs, Alabama 35124, and you have received an email confirmation of receipt of that entry form and payment.  Only then will your registration appear on the listing of registrants for the tournament on AskFred.net.  If your name does not appear on the listing of registrants for the tournament on AskFred.net, then your entry form and payment have not been received and you are NOT registered for the qualifying tournament.   If you do not contact me before the March 30, 2006 deadline and make arrangements to get your entry form and payment to me no later than midnight on March 30, 2006, there is nothing I can do to register you for the qualifying tournament after that time.  The deadline will be strictly enforced.  Anyone checking AskFred.net at midnight on March 30, 2006 will see the complete listing of all fencers who are registered for each event.  If you have any questions or any problems registering on AskFred.net, please contact Carol Gray Caldwell at 205-988-0947 before the March 30, 2006 deadline.\r\n\r\nYou will be notified by email, at the email address you have listed for your account on AskFred.net, on March 31, 2006, of the times for each event for this tournament, and of any events which will not be held due to the small number of fencers registered for that event.  In general, it is anticipated that Youth 14 and Under 16 events will be scheduled in the morning and Div. II and Div. III events will be scheduled in the afternoon.  The Div. II and Div. III events may be fenced as combined events for some or all weapons.\r\n\r\nYou must be a competitive member of the Alabama Division of the USFA to fence in this tournament.  Membership forms are available on the USFA website at www.usfencing.org.  You may also apply for membership at the registration desk at the tournament.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at CGCwell@aol.com or at 205-988-0947.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCarol Gray Caldwell\r\nAlabama Division Secretary\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nALABAMA DIVISION\r\nSUMMER NATIONALS QUALIFIER\r\nAPRIL 2, 2006\r\n\r\nName:____________________________________Club:_________________\r\nAddress:__________________________________Division:________________\r\nCity:_____________________ State:______ Zip:_______  \/  \/Male    \/  \/ Female\r\nBirth Date:_____\/ ________\/________USFA Number:____________________\r\nEmail address to contact:____________________________________________\r\n\r\nFees ($25 for the first event; $10 for each additional event):\r\n\t\r\nMen\u0092s Epee - Youth 14* _____\r\nMen\u0092s Foil - Youth 14* _____\r\nMen\u0092s Sabre - Youth 14* _____\t\r\nWomen\u0092s Epee - Youth 14* _____\t\r\nWomen\u0092s Foil - Youth 14* _____\r\nWomen\u0092s Sabre - Youth 14* _____\r\nMen\u0092s Epee - Under 16** _____\r\nMen\u0092s Foil - Under 16** _____\r\nMen\u0092s Sabre - Under 16** _____\t\r\nWomen\u0092s Epee - Under 16** _____\t\r\nWomen\u0092s Foil - Under 16** _____\r\nWomen\u0092s Sabre - Under 16** _____\t\t\t\r\nMen\u0092s Epee - Div.

As noted on the entry form, the tournament committee modifies the schedule after pre-registration closes, in order to have a smooth-running event. Our goal is to make best use of the strips available and have events run on time as much as possible.\r\n  All team events, and 16WF, 16WS, 14WF, 14WE, 14WS, 14MS will not be fenced, due to insufficient entries.  All the teams and individuals that pre-registered have qualified, and will receive a refund if fees for these events have been paid.\r\n  The Annual meeting of the Georgia Division will be held on Saturday, April 8th at the venue immediately after fencing is completed.  On the agenda are the annual officers' reports, election of officers for the 2006-2007 fencing season, discussion about the newly-established Georgia\r\nDivision Championships, and an update from the Local Organizing Comittee for the 2006 Summer Nationals being held in Atlanta.  Your attendance and input at the meeting is valued and appreciated.
