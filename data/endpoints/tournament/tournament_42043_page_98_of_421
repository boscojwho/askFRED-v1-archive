Through our grant program, our organization identifies and supports exciting projects involving young people all throughout the nation. Bike & Build also supports local affordable housing organizations along each route through on the road donations.\r\n\r\nAll proceeds from this event will be donated to two young adults from Dayton, OH who will be biking from Boston to Santa Barbara this summer(starting June 20th) with Bike and Build. Along the way they will be stopping at communities to participate in affordable housing projects and educate the communities about the affordable housing crisis. Courtney Curtner and Ryan Schepers need to raise the full cost of the trip themselves and some of the funds will be used for the housing projects. Bike and Build even donates a portion to a local affordable housing charity, which is the Dayton chapter of Habitat for Humanity. These two have raised a majority of the funds but need our help to meet their goal.\r\n\r\nYou can learn more about them from their Bike and Build profiles here:\r\nhttp:\/\/bikeandbuild.org\/rider\/3865\r\nhttp:\/\/bikeandbuild.org\/rider\/3866\r\n\r\nYou can donate directly to them through their profiles as well. \r\n\r\nOn top of the tournament fee, there will be a donation jar where we will accept any amount.\r\n\r\nAnother way to donate is to Sponsor a Fencer! At this event you can pledge a certain amount of money per touch or per bout that fencer Peter McOwen gets. So if you pledge $1 per touch and I get 40 touches throughout the day, you will donate $40 to Bike and Build. The same applies per bout, if I win 10 bouts then you will donate $10 to Bike and Build!

Initially, we are scheduling a circuit of four tournaments starting in June and extending through July, August, and September.  Prizes will be awarded to top finishers for each tournament as well as to the top point-holder at the end of the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe Viper Cup tournaments are scheduled for Friday evenings starting at 6:30 PM and will end no later than 9:30. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to run fencing tournaments at an economical cost and a convenient time that will maximize the number of competitive bouts for all participants, both to develop fencing skills as well as to have fun.   Participation is limited to C-ranked fencers and below.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Entry & Fee<\/b>\r\nFencers can enter by registering at AskFred or by simply showing up the evening of the tournament.  In either case the entry fee is $10.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Dates and Times<\/b>\r\nThe inaugural series of the Viper Cup tournaments will be held on 6\/4, 7\/2, 8\/6, and 9\/3.  The tournaments will start at 6:30 PM.  However, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be closing check-in at any particular time, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running late, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still be able to fence as long as you arrive before 8:15 PM.\r\n \r\n\r\n<b>Competition Format<\/b>\r\nIn order to finish the competition in 3 hours, the Viper Cup tournaments will use a non-standard competition format.   There will be a single initial round-robin pool with 100% promotion followed by a single-elimination tableau.  \r\n\r\n<i>-Round Robin Pool<\/i>\r\nPool matches will start promptly at 6:30PM.  Any fencer arriving after 6:30 can still join the pool and begin fencing.  Pool matches will be fenced opportunistically instead of according to a pre-scheduled order.  Matches will be to 5 points and last three minutes.  The round robin pool will end either when all fencers have fenced everyone else in the competition or at 8:15 PM, whichever happens first.\r\n\r\n<i>-Seeding<\/i>\r\nSince not all fencers will necessarily have fenced the same number of bouts, we will use a nonstandard seeding method into the elimination tableau.  Seeding will be based on the number of victories followed by the touch differential.  Seeding ties will be resolved with preference to the fencer with more bouts fenced and then according to fewer touches received.\r\n\r\n<i>-Single-Elimination Tableau<\/i>   \r\nElimination matches will start at 8:30 PM, or 15 minutes after the end of the round-robin pool, whichever comes first.  Fencers will be ranked according to their results in the table and paired accordingly. All elimination matches will be 3 out 5 3-touch bouts, winning by 2 points to a maximum of 4.  Each three-touch bout in the match will have a time limit of 1 \u00c2\u00bd minutes, with a 30 second break in between.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Points and Prizes<\/b>\r\nThe top three places in each Viper Cup tournament will be awarded medals.  Viper Cup Circuit Points will be awarded to each finisher according to their place.  At the end of the circuit, the Viper Cup Circuit Champion will win a $50 gift certificate to Blue Gauntlet\/Absolute Fencing\/???.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Circuit Point Schedule:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPlace\tPoints\r\n1st - \t10\r\n2nd - \t8\r\n3rd - \t6\r\n5th to 8th - \t4\r\n9th to 12th - \t3\r\n13th to 16th -\t2\r\n17th and higher - 1\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Viper Cup point standings will be posted on AskFred.\r\n\r\n<b>Address and Directions<\/b>\r\nCobra Fencing Club\r\n4th Floor\r\nLackawanna Warehouse\r\n629 Grove Street, 4th Floor\r\nJersey, City NJ\r\nTel 201 882 2879\r\n\r\nFrom Manhattan by train: PATH train from Manhattan to Hoboken.
