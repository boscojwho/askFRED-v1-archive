Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73208,"tournament_id":17378,"tournament":"Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17141,"name":"Day of the Fencer","start_date":"2012-01-15","end_date":"","comments":"Join MTFC at the Tacoma Convention Center for a day of Saber!

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70499,"tournament_id":16661,"tournament":"Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-01-22T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17179,"name":"Youth-14 Summer Natl.

Because of the amount of no-call or no shows, it's difficult to compensate Directors who are confirmed in advance. To help promote the pre-payment option, we have reduced our rate to $20 if you use the pre-payment method.  Pre-payment is NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-TRANSFERABLE.  If you are not sure if you can make it, just pre-register without pre-pay.  You can always go back into your AskFred Account and pre-pay up until the cut-off date. AskFred charges an extra $0.99 fee.  \r\n\r\n*For those who pre-register, please UN-REGISTER yourself or email\/call us if you cannot attend our events. Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season. After the 3rd infringement, your registration will need pre-approval, and an additional fee of $10 will be collected and DONATED to the American Red Cross upon check-in.  \r\n\r\ne: hello[at]redstarfencing.com    \"@\" replaces [at]\r\np: +1 773 349 3074\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 12\/20\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on FRI 01\/20\/2012 at 11:59PM CT.\r\n","venue":{"name":"REDSTAR FENCING CLUB","address":"3735 W BELMONT AVE","city":"CHICAGO","state":"IL","zip":"60618","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":41.9391015,"longitude":-87.7212411,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":72846,"tournament_id":17270,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & VetFoil","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-01-22T08:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":72847,"tournament_id":17270,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & VetFoil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":14,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-01-22T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":72848,"tournament_id":17270,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & VetFoil","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-01-22T08:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":72849,"tournament_id":17270,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & VetFoil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":22,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-01-22T11:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":17289,"name":"Sword in the Snow C and Under","start_date":"2012-01-22","end_date":"","comments":"Come in out of the cold and have fun fencing!

The top 8 finishers in the senior events will qualify for Division I-A at Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that compete in the senior events will automatically qualify for the corresponding veteran event at Summer Nationals.  Competing in the veteran events on Friday evening WILL NOT qualify you for Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Schedule ----------\r\n\r\nFriday 1\/27\/12:\r\n6:00 pm - Doors open\r\n6:30 pm - Veteran Mixed Foil, Epee, and Saber\r\n\r\nSaturday 1\/28\/12:\r\n7:00 am  -- Doors open\r\n8:00 am  -- Senior Women's Foil & Senior Men's Saber\r\n11:30 am -- Senior Men's Epee\r\n\r\nSunday 1\/29\/12:\r\n7:00 am -- Doors open\r\n8:00 am -- Senior Men's Foil\r\nNoon    -- Senior Women's Epee\r\n2:00 pm -- Senior Women's Saber \r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.
