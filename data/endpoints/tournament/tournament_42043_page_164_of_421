Y10 and Y12 fencers who wish to fence at Summer Nationals must fence at least one RYC.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to fence at this RYC, please pre-register on FRED and pay your entry fee by Wednesday, October 31st. Late registrants will pay double fees!\r\n\r\nSABER FENCERS PLEASE READ: We will run any event that has at least two fencers in it. For saber fencers ONLY, if you want to fence but aren't sure if your event will happen, you may register on FRED, skip the payment portion, and pay at the door. You must still be on the list on FRED by Wednesday to avoid late fees, so we can plan for referees. If you have prepaid your entry fee and your event doesn't happen, your entry fee (not counting FRED's fee) will be refunded. We will notify you of any event cancellation by email.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in refereeing or helping with equipment checks, please let us know.\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info: -------------------\r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Regional Youth Circuit\r\nDate(s): 11\/03\/2012 - 11\/04\/2012\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n1776 136th Place NE\r\nBellevue, WA 98005\r\n(425) 747-6300\r\ninfo@raincityfencing.com\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 3rd\r\n9:00 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10 Epee, Y14 Foil\r\n11:00 AM - Y12 Epee\r\n1:00 PM - Y10 Foil\r\n2:00 PM - Y14 Epee\r\n\r\nSunday, November 4th\r\n9:00 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y12 Sabre\r\n11:00 AM - Y12 Foil\r\n12:00 PM - Y10 Sabre\r\n1:00 PM - Y14 Sabre\r\n\r\nAll times listed are close of registration. Events with simultaneous close of registration may not necessarily be fenced at the same time.\r\n\r\nAll events will be fenced mixed (boys and girls together). Separate awards for boys' and girls' placements will be given.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility:\r\n\r\nY10 - Fencers born in 2002-2005\r\nY12 - Fencers born in 2000-2003\r\nY14 - Fencers born in 1998-2001\r\n\r\nEquipment Requirements:\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark all lames, masks, and body cords. Weight testing and other weapon inspection will be done at the strip. Y10 fencers must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including fencing pants, long socks, and underarm protector, must be worn. Names on uniforms are not required. Fencers should bring a minimum of two working weapons and body cords to the strip. Rain City Fencing Center has equipment available for purchase.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil (or sabre) masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2012-2013) competitive members of USA Fencing (or Canadian Fencing Federation). You may join or renew your membership at the door. Please bring your card as proof of membership!\r\n\r\nFees and Registration:\r\n\r\nTournament entry fee is $20 (plus sales tax) per event entered. Entry fees should be prepaid on AskFRED (see links below) or at RCFC. Rain City Fencing Center accepts cash, checks, VISA, MasterCard, and debit cards.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Pre-registration deadline is Wednesday, October 31st. Registration is due by then to avoid double entry fees!\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19712\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/31\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Late registrations are triple the registration fee, payable at the door.\r\n\r\nIf you join the USFA at the venue, and are not listed on their official list, you will compete as an unrated fencer to avoid the risk of invalidating your event.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE POLICY\r\nTIME POSTED MAY CHANGE BASED ON PARTICIPATION.  Unlike typical local tourneys, qualifiers must include all applicable events on the schedule.  As it becomes clear which events must be fenced, the schedule will adjust for the benefit for all.  Keep checking back.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT POLICY\r\n\r\nZERO TOLERANCE FOR POOR CONDUCT. This applies to every human soul in the venue.

We go above and beyond to select the best referees the local community has to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFETY POLICY\r\n\r\nMasks and body cords will be tested as usual. Full fencing attire is required, including socks that meet the knee. If you show up with crew socks (or no socks), you will not be permitted to fence.\r\n\r\nConductive foil bibs are required for this qualifier, per the USFA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Tampa Fencing Academy","address":"5406 Hoover Blvd, Unite 3 & 4","city":"Tampa","state":"FL","zip":"33634","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.01574,"longitude":-82.5510469,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":83514,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Epee","short_name":"CdWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":83515,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Foil","short_name":"CdWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":83516,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":83517,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Foil","short_name":"CdMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":83518,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":83519,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":83520,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":5,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":83521,"tournament_id":20294,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-03T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":19554,"name":"NWFC Progressive #2","start_date":"2012-11-03","end_date":"","comments":"NWFC Progressive : Two series of 4 tournaments designed for beginner and intermediate fencers.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82492,"tournament_id":20013,"tournament":"FAP Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-04T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20021,"name":"2nd Annual Peter Folgner Memorial Sabre Tournament","start_date":"2012-11-04","end_date":"","comments":"2 Events: \r\nC and Under Senior Mixed Sabre. \r\nY14 Mixed Sabre.\r\n$25 entry fee.\r\n$35 entry fee if reg. on-site on day of the tournament.\r\nMust be a current member of the USFA","prereg_open":"2012-09-17","prereg_close":"2012-11-03","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Two events:\r\nY-14 Mixed Sabre \r\nC and Under Senior Mixed Sabre\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/17\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/03\/2012.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 10am.\r\n\r\n$25 entry fee if pre-registered.\r\n$35 entry fee if registering on-site on day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nMust be a current member of the USFA when pre-registering.\r\nMust present proof of USFA membership when registering at event.\r\n\r\n100% promotion to DE's.\r\nMedals for first, second, and tie for third. \r\nWinner also will earn a $25 gift certificate from Absolute Fencing Gear.\r\n\r\nLink for directions: http:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/K2kKD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"York Fencing Club at the York YMCA","address":"90 N.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"195 W 58 Street, New York, NY 10019","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661745,"longitude":-73.9794156,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82064,"tournament_id":19900,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #2 (Epee)","full_name":"BAbove Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"B+SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":16,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-11-04T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":18888,"name":"Cadet & Little Kid's Halloween Boogie","start_date":"2012-11-04","end_date":"","comments":"Compete for the laughing pumpkin trophy.\r\nCustom medals and laughing pumpkin trophies to 8 places $30 pre reg. $35 at door.$5 checkin fee at door.

Each year we focus on a different segment of our fencing population.  This year, it's adult fencers, from our older college students all the way to our oldest veterans, and from our adult beginners and recreational fencers through seasoned competitors.  Anyone who is too old for Junior age group events (i.e. born 1992 or earlier) is welcome to participate in this year's Development Day. \r\n\r\nYou don't have to participate in both the workshop and the tournament, but we really hope you will.  Cost if registered 5 days in advance: $10 for your first event (whether it's a workshop or a competition), $5 per additional event.  First event cost goes up to $20 if you register late.  Register for competitive events here, follow the links below to the \"Clinics\" section of AskFRED to sign up for workshops.\r\n\r\nThe day's schedule:\r\n\r\n10 a.m-noon. Clinic.  Experienced fencers will work one on one or in very small groups with less experienced fencers (from this fall's beginners through E rated competitors), to give you feedback on your technique and ideas for new things to try on the strip.  You will have a chance to take 5-6 mini-lessons with different mentors (or if you have less energy or an injury, you can choose to do less, and watch more...it's entirely up to you).  To sign up for this clinic, click here:\r\nwww.askfred.net\/Clinics\/whoIsComing.php?clinic_id=20039\r\n\r\n12:30 p.m.  Round Robin Foil and Epee Tournament.  This will consist entirely of 5-touch bouts (no elimination matches, so everyone gets to do the same amount of fencing).  USFA competitive membership is not required, and no ratings will be earned; however Champlain Cup points may be earned as usual.  This format will allow experienced fencers to coach newbies, and let adult beginners ease into competition in a fun, low pressure way.  You may fence just foil, just epee, or if you are really full of energy, you may do both, but be ready to run back and forth between them.\r\n\r\n5 p.m. Happy hour!  Pizza and drinks at a nearby restaurant.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Vergennes Union High School - middle school gym","address":"50 Monkton Rd","city":"Vergennes","state":"VT","zip":"05491","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":44.170219,"longitude":-73.242821,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":82,"name":"Green Mountain","abbrev":"GRMT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82579,"tournament_id":20038,"tournament":"GMD Development Day-\"Adults Only!\"","full_name":"Senior Mixed Round Robin Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":11,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"Round Robin","close_of_reg":"2012-11-10T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":82580,"tournament_id":20038,"tournament":"GMD Development Day-\"Adults Only!\"","full_name":"Senior Mixed Round Robin Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":12,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"Round Robin","close_of_reg":"2012-11-10T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20296,"name":"The Grizzly Open","start_date":"2012-11-10","end_date":"","comments":"The Grizzly Open is hosted by the Wadsworth Fencing Club.
