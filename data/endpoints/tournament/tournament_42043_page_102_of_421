Initially, we are scheduling a circuit of four tournaments starting in June and extending through July, August, and September.  Prizes will be awarded to top finishers for each tournament as well as to the top point-holder at the end of the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe Viper Cup tournaments are scheduled for Friday evenings starting at 6:30 PM and will end no later than 9:30. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to run fencing tournaments at an economical cost and a convenient time that will maximize the number of competitive bouts for all participants, both to develop fencing skills as well as to have fun.   Participation is limited to C-ranked fencers and below.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry & Fee\r\nFencers can enter by registering at AskFred or by simply showing up the evening of the tournament.  In either case the entry fee is $10.\r\n\r\n\r\nDates and Times\r\nThe inaugural series of the Viper Cup tournaments will be held on 6\/4, 7\/2, 8\/6, and 9\/3.  The tournaments will start at 6:30 PM.  However, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be closing check-in at any particular time, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running late, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still be able to fence as long as you arrive before 8:15 PM.\r\n \r\n\r\nCompetition Format\r\nIn order to finish the competition in 3 hours, the Viper Cup tournaments will use a non-standard competition format.   There will be a single initial round-robin pool with 100% promotion followed by a single-elimination tableau.  \r\n\r\n-Round Robin Pool\r\nPool matches will start promptly at 6:30PM.  Any fencer arriving after 6:30 can still join the pool and begin fencing.  Pool matches will be fenced opportunistically instead of according to a pre-scheduled order.  Matches will be to 5 points and last three minutes.  The round robin pool will end either when all fencers have fenced everyone else in the competition or at 8:15 PM, whichever happens first.\r\n\r\n-Seeding\r\nSince not all fencers will necessarily have fenced the same number of bouts, we will use a nonstandard seeding method into the elimination tableau.  Seeding will be based on the number of victories followed by the touch differential.  Seeding ties will be resolved with preference to the fencer with more bouts fenced and then according to fewer touches received.\r\n\r\n-Single-Elimination Tableau   \r\nElimination matches will start at 8:30 PM, or 15 minutes after the end of the round-robin pool, whichever comes first.  Fencers will be ranked according to their results in the table and paired accordingly. All elimination matches will be 3 out 5 3-touch bouts, winning by 2 points to a maximum of 4.  Each three-touch bout in the match will have a time limit of 1 \u00c2\u00bd minutes, with a 30 second break in between.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPoints and Prizes\r\nThe top three places in each Viper Cup tournament will be awarded medals.  Viper Cup Circuit Points will be awarded to each finisher according to their place.  At the end of the circuit, the Viper Cup Circuit Champion will win a $50 gift certificate to Blue Gauntlet\/Absolute Fencing\/???.\r\n\r\n\r\nCircuit Point Schedule:\r\n\r\nPlace\tPoints\r\n1st - \t10\r\n2nd - \t8\r\n3rd - \t6\r\n5th to 8th - \t4\r\n9th to 12th - \t3\r\n13th to 16th -\t2\r\n17th and higher - 1\r\n\r\nFinal Viper Cup Circuit Point Results:\r\n<table border=\".1\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<th>Rank <\/th><th>Name              <\/th><th>Club                <\/th><th>Point Total  <\/th><th>VC#1 <\/th><th>VC#2 <\/th><th>VC#3 <\/th><th>VC#4 <\/th><\/tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>1<\/td><td>Swansan, Lars<\/td><td>AFA<\/td><td>28<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>2<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>2<\/td><td>Wright, Rashad<\/td><td>NJFA<\/td><td>26<\/td><td>1<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>1<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>3<\/td><td>Chester, Bernie<\/td><td>Cobra<\/td><td>22<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>5<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>4<\/td><td>Yin, Matthew<\/td><td>Ridege HS<\/td><td>14<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>3<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>5T<\/td><td>Spiridakis, Tyler<\/td><td>Medeo II<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>2<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>5T<\/td><td>Mitreuter, Michael<\/td><td>NJFA<\/td><td>12<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><td>7<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>7<\/td><td>Sheehan, James<\/td><td>Cobra<\/td><td>9<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>6<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>8<\/td><td>Erbach, John<\/td><td>Cobra<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>3<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>9T<\/td><td>Gowda, Tejasvi<\/td><td>Tigerz FA<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>9T<\/td><td>Korn, Mark<\/td><td>Giv Liv HS<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>9T<\/td><td>Mangonello<\/td><td>Medeo<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>4<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>12T<\/td><td>Persaud, Javas<\/td><td>Cobra<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>5<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><tr>\r\n<td>12T<\/td><td>Chee, Andrew<\/td><td>Empire United<\/td><td>4<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>6<\/td><td>0<\/td><td>0<\/td><tr>\r\n<\/tr>\r\n<\/table>\r\n\r\nAddress and Directions\r\nCobra Fencing Club\r\n4th Floor\r\nLackawanna Warehouse\r\n629 Grove Street, 4th Floor\r\nJersey, City NJ\r\nTel 201 882 2879\r\n\r\nFrom Manhattan by train: PATH train from Manhattan to Hoboken.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/01\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48665,"tournament_id":11304,"tournament":"Open Sabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":19,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-09-11T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12347,"name":"2nd Annual LaBelle Buffalo","start_date":"2010-09-11","end_date":"","comments":"$15 per event.

If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Foil \r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/09\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519  Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48668,"tournament_id":11307,"tournament":"D Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":31,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-09-12T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12611,"name":"Bay Cup @ MTeam:  Y12MF, Y14MF","start_date":"2010-09-12","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-09-03","prereg_close":"2010-09-11","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nY12 Men's Foil\r\nY14 Men's Foil\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nHalberstadt Fencers' Club (hosted by MTEAM).\r\n\r\nFees:\r\nThis is a Bay Cup tournament.
