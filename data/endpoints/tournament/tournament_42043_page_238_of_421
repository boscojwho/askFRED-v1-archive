The division has specially designed dog tags as prizes for places 4-8, as well as its own Oregon Division medals to places 1-3. \r\n\r\nDepending on the age of the fencer, points earned at this event help qualify the fencer for Summer Nationals. Y10 fencers must only have some regional points. Note that currently all fencers in Regional Youth Circuits (RYCs) tournaments earn regional points. For Y12, the fencer must be in the top 50% for regional points (in his or her region), or finish any SYC in the top 40%. Only points earned at RYCs within a fencer\u0092s own region count towards qualification. Y14 qualifies by either (1) being on the Y14 national point standings, (2) being in the top 25% for Y14 regional points, (3) being in the top 16 of the Y12 national point standings, (4) being in the top eight of the Y12 regional point standings, or (5) placing in the top 25% in the Y14 Division qualifying competition for the current season. All events will be run separated by gender in an effort to maximize points for each gender\/weapon group since qualification for Summer Nationals can depend on RYC regional point totals. So unless there is only one entrant, we will not run mixed events.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: At least 2 athletes must compete (have fenced) in a given RYC age\/weapon event. Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed will not result in the athlete fulfilling the qualification requirement. \r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD! All fencers must be current USFA members and be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership. Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nFull USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or sabre, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. All Y10 fencers will be required to use size \"0\" or size \"2\" blades (i.e., less than 32.5 inches long). Foil events require conductive foil masks.\r\n\r\nDE Format: Y10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 hits or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. Y12 direct elimination bouts are for 15 hits or end when 3 periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period have passed. \r\n\r\nEquipment checks will be conducted . Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event. Limited types of replacement equipment are available at NWFC (venue). To facilitate the equipment check, we may be offering equipment checks on Friday night. If so, details will be posted on this website, and emails sent to the pre-registered fencers. Please make sure that AskFred has your current email.\r\n\r\nAge Requirements (2014-2015 Season only):\r\nY10: Birth years of 2004 - 2007\r\nY12: Birth years of 2002 - 2005\r\nY14: Birth years of 2000 - 2003\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFred is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Friday night, 3\/20\/2015 (i.e. ONE WEEK before the event) \r\n\r\nFees: \"on-time\" registration fees are $15 per fencer, plus $15 per event (i.e., a total of $30 for one event) for those that preregister on AskFred on time. After the close of regular pre-registration time to midnight of the day prior to the tournament (March 28), fencers are welcome at triple registration fee and double event fee, if the board was emailed that you plan to fence. The day of the event you may fence with a walk-in fee of double triple. However, we don\u0092t want that, so please just register on time and save yourself some money.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that we only accept cash or checks at Division events. CREDIT CARDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED. Please make checks out to the Oregon Division\/USFA. \r\n\r\nHealthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area. In the same building, Dorothy's Diner has affordable diner-style fare. Off-site food within 2 blocks has something for everybody: Uwajimaya (Japanese\/grocery), Togos (deli), Koreana (Korean), Round Table (pizza), KFC (fast food), Hawaiian Time (Hawaiian).  \r\n\r\nOn July 17th, 2013, the USFA Board of Directors adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines new requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. \r\n\r\nCome support our kids, families, and sport!

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they are pre-qualified as described below.)\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  All fencers must be US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\nIf you have already qualified for Div II\/III\/Y14 through another means (see below), you can still attend this event.  You won't \"take up\" a qualification since you are already qualified - instead, you'll help the numbers but will be skipped when awarding qualifications.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule by Weapon -----\r\n\r\nMen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 1:00pm Sunday\r\n\r\nWomen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 1:00pm Saturday\r\n\r\nMen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 1:00pm Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 12 noon Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 10:00am Sunday\r\n\r\nMen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 11:30am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 1:30pm Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 11:30am Saturday\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe registration fee is $20 per event.  \r\n\r\nRegistration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm PDT on Wednesday March 25th.  If you do not register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nEvent fees must be paid at the door.  We accept cash, check (made out to \"WWD\"), and credit cards.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=27049\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nEvents with 14 or fewer fencers will be run as a single round of pools followed by a direct elimination.\r\n\r\nEvents with 15 or more fencers will be run as TWO rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.  The combined results from the two pool rounds will be used to seed the DE tableau.  In events with more than 20 fencers, we will do a cut after the second round of pools based on the number of entries.\r\n\r\nThis two-rounds-of-pools format has proven to be popular with the fencers since it gives everyone a lot of fencing.  It also tends to \"smooth out\" the seeding - if you fence poorly in the first round of pools, you can redeem yourself by fencing well in the second round.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 2001 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 2000 - 2003\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14.  If you qualified for Division II at a Div II ROC like Bladefest, you are already qualified for Div II\/III.  Y14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event.\r\n\r\nThe USFA tracks who has already qualified on the Summer Nationals page on the USFA website.  Check the spreadsheet on that page for your name to see if you are listed as pre-qualified.  If you are unsure, ASK YOUR COACH!\r\n\r\nPre-qualified fencers are still welcome to fence at this event, since it helps the numbers and does not deny someone else a qualifier slot.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict (such as being out of town on business.)  \r\n\r\nContact chair@wwdfencing.org for more info on petitions.","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot behind building, enter from Glenside Avenue. We are Suite 201, Building C.  Bring food and drink, their are changing rooms but no showers.  The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0974096,"longitude":-75.1452389,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113952,"tournament_id":28780,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-29T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28014,"name":"North Shore Fencers Club (Y14-12) & Y10 Mixed Foil","start_date":"2015-03-29","end_date":"","comments":"Doors open 45 minutes prior to close of registration for the event.

RYC serve as a qualifying path for Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. The top 50% (Y12) and 25% (Y14) on each Regions RRPS will earn qualification to their respective event at that seasons Summer National Championships. (Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at SNs will be National Championships. The Y10 path to qualification remains participation in an RYC or SYC = qualification. Y12 has been adjusted from participation to a top 50% qualification standard. Y14 has been adjusted from the winner of an RYC earns qualification to the top 25% on the RRPS. NRPS earned at SYC or NAC tournaments remain a qualifying path as does the Y14 Divisional qualifier. The qualifying standards for the Youth NAC have NOT changed)\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Given the current number and concentration of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, it was determined that up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. For more details on this initiative, visit http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/3283\/2014-2015_Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative.pdf\r\n\r\nForeign fencers can compete at any RYC. If they compete out of Region they will not appear on that Region\u0092s Point List nor will points from an outside region transfer to an athletes point total in their home region. Railstation will sort them out. However, their participation will be counted in the overall entrants and be included when the points are calculated for the fencers who competed in their home region. A fencer can ONLY win the Regional Patch Award for the Region they reside in. \r\n\r\nQualification: \r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10\/12\/14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament requirements. \r\n\r\nQualification paths for Y10\/12\/14 are maintained in the Athletes Handbook (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook).\r\n\r\nSummer National Championships: Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, the Y10 and Y12 events at Summer Nationals will be designated as National Championship Events.

The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nY12\/Y14 DE format: Y12 and Y14 DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break between) During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\r\n\u0095 No fence-off for third place; Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc . Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout.

Proof of membership is required. You may verify your membership and division affiliation at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nPlease resolve any division issues directly with USFA on or before Friday, March 23 2015 so we can verify your eligibility. If you are a new member, you should be aware that you may compete in the division within which you live or the division within which your affiliated club is located.\r\n\r\nUSFA NATIONAL QUALIFIERS ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nAthletes are permitted to fence in their Division qualifying competitions only IF:\r\n1) The athlete is a U.S. citizen OR permanent resident and a current COMPETITIVE member of USA FENCING with an expiration date of 7\/31\/2015 or later AND\r\n2) The athlete is a member of that division AND\r\n3) The athlete represents the United States in international competition AND\r\n4) The athlete's birth year falls in that age bracket OR\r\n5) The athlete is on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket\r\n\r\nAny fencer who is a citizen or permanent resident who has represented another country in the last three years is NOT eligible for any Junior Olympic Fencing Championships competition, individual or team, including corresponding Division qualifying competitions. A foreign fencer who is in the US on a visa is NOT eligible to fence in any National Championships or the Division qualifying competition.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENT FEE STRUCTURE:\r\n\r\n$40 per event if pre-registered on or before 3\/23\/2015\r\n\r\n$80 per event if late registration (between 3\/24 \u0096 3\/27 inclusive); askFRED will not allow pre-registration during the \u0093late registration\u0094 period; you must use the \u0093email the organizer\u0094 feature in askFRED to register late at the $80 per event fee.\r\n\r\n$120 per event walk-in registration\r\n\r\nWe will allow walk-in registrations at the penalty rate of $120 per event. This will be allowed at the bout committee\u0092s discretion. We will not allow walk-ins if we cannot verify the fencer\u0092s eligibility from the information we download from USFA fencing on Friday 3\/27\/2015. If an event has been cancelled because there were three or fewer pre-registrants, we will not allow walk-ins.\r\n\r\nFees are payable by CASH or CHECK ONLY.\r\nCheck made payable to Central California Division USFA.\r\nWe DO NOT take credit or debit cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINING THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIERS:\r\n\r\nThe number of qualifiers is 25% of the entrants, ROUNDED UP (e.g. 13 fencers = 4 qualifiers) with a minimum of three. If there are three or fewer pre-registrants we will try to contact you. Unless we tell you before the tournament that the event is cancelled, you will need to come, however you might not need to fence. We will not cancel any event before the end of the late preregistration period.\r\n\r\nQualification paths are listed in Chapter 2 of the Athlete Handbook.\r\n\r\nIf the last qualifying spot is tied, there must be a fence off to determine qualification. \r\nFor regional qualifiers, if there is only one entrant the qualifier will not count and the fencer should use an alternate qualification path.\r\n\r\n*Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed or fenced mixed will not result in the athlete fulfilling the qualification requirement.\r\n** Events with 2 entrants will be cancelled and all 2 fencers in those events will auto-qualify.\r\n*** For events with 3 entrants, please show up to fence in this division even though all 3 fencers in those events will auto-qualify.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE OF DETERMINING THE QUALIFIERS:\r\n\r\n(If a fencer is already qualified, how would he\/she impact or change the qualifying event?)\r\n\r\nIn determining the number of qualifiers, the number of competitors is the total number of fencers who competed in the qualifying competition who are eligible to fence in the Championships. Once the qualifying competition is complete and the number of qualified athletes is determined, those who have already qualified to the Championships in that event (athletes determined to be automatic qualifiers) are skipped in determining those who have become qualifiers in that competition. For example, if there are 20 competitors \r\nin the qualifying competition, of whom four have already qualified for that particular championships event, those four are skipped in determining the five qualifiers from that competition. So, if the ones who are automatic qualifiers are 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, then the qualifiers from this competition are those who have placed 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIGIBLE BIRTH YEARS:\r\n\r\nYOUTH 14:  Y14:  BORN 2000-2003\r\n\r\nEXCEPTION TO AGE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (All other qualification criteria remains): \r\n\r\nYouth 14 \u0096 A fencer born after 2003 can fence in Youth 14 IF the fencer is on the National Youth 12 point standings at the time of the entry deadline for that tournament.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION AWARD:\r\n\r\nClassifications can be awarded at a qualifying competition. Classification changes and qualification will be based on the eligible fencers in the competition as submitted. Y14 events must attain a rating of C1 or greater for any classifications to be awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE QUALIFYING EVENTS:\r\n\r\nQualification status after these competitions is not final until confirmed by the National Office.\r\n\r\nThe USA Fencing National Championship Entry Form is posted on the USA FENCING website under Events on the Nationals Tournament web site or competitors may register online at: https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/USFencing\/. \r\nEntries remain pending until results from the qualifying competition are received and processed.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Summer National Championship, visit the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/389098?referrer_id=669372\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFIER EVENTS SCHEDULED:\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent starting times may be adjusted in order to minimize the interval between close of registration and the start of the event: please MAKE SURE YOUR ASKFRED EMAIL ADDRESS IS VALID AND CHECK YOUR EMAIL DURING THE WEEK PRIOR to the tournament.\r\n\r\nY14 Men's Foil: 9:00AM\r\nY14 Women's Epee 9:30AM\r\nY14 Women's Foil: 12:30PM\r\nY14 Men's Epee: 1:00PM\r\nY14 Women's Saber: 2:00PM\r\nY14 Men's Saber: 3:00PM\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/28\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/23\/2015.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"The Fencing Center of San Jose","address":"1290 South First Street","city":"San Jose","state":"CA","zip":"95110","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.31803,"longitude":-121.87484,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113235,"tournament_id":28577,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":32,"prereg_count":33,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-29T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113236,"tournament_id":28577,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":15,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-29T09:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113237,"tournament_id":28577,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":16,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-29T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113238,"tournament_id":28577,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":15,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-29T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113239,"tournament_id":28577,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-29T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113240,"tournament_id":28577,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-03-29T15:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28843,"name":"DVFC Unclassified\/Div 2 Foil","start_date":"2015-03-29","end_date":"","comments":"Born in or before 2001.

Make sure not to block any driveways or fire hydrants or your car may be towed.\r\n\r\nCheck-In\r\n\r\nFollow the signs for event entry to the entrance from the driveway off Village Park Road. The check in table will be just inside this door. Automated bar code check-in will be used so you MUST have your USFA membership card with you. Swipe your card to check-in for your event. Check-in for each event will be open one hour before the event. You must check-in for each event you are entered in when fencing more than one event. Proceed down the hall to the main fencing gym where you can store your bag.\r\n\r\nBag and Equipment Storage\r\n\r\nIn the main fencing gym there are two areas for bag storage. Along the back wall there is a bag storage railing similar to what you may have seen at Mission Fencing. Bags stored here are to be placed on end behind the railing. Bags may also be stored underneath the bleachers. The bags are to be slid in end first perpendicular with the bleachers. Follow these procedures and there is storage for over 170 bags at any one time. Bags left in the walking aisles will be removed by security to a central location. Do not bring your bag to the strip; bring only your spare weapons and body cords and water\/sports drink.\r\n\r\nWeapons\/Equipment Check\r\n\r\nBody cords, masks, lames, and gloves will be checked as per normal USFA qualifying tournament rules. The armorers running the equipment checks will be at the end of the central hallway. To maintain good traffic flow, proceed down the left side of the hallway and return to the fencing area on the right. There will be a divider in the hallway to help guide you. The armorers are there to test equipment, not to make repairs. There will be a commercial armorer on site for your repair needs.\r\n\r\nStrip Procedure for Fencers, Coaches, and Spectators\r\n\r\nFencers shall hook up to and unhook from the reels at the end of the strip whether using a box reel or overhead reel system. All those not actually fencing (coaches, spectators and waiting fencers) shall remain behind the warning zone of the strip. Referees will be instructed to award cards to any who refuse to heed this rule.\r\n\r\nFood\r\n\r\nDO NOT PACK your lunch: We are pleased to share the word that the ORIGINAL SOUPMAN (Seinfelds Soup Nazi - No Soup For You) SOUP MOBILE will be parked outside our facility.  Enjoy special delicious soups, lobster roll, and other fare. \r\n\r\nPro-Shop \r\n\r\nDid your mask fail the punch test? Did you forget your socks? Need a new glove or a fresh lame? Break a blade? Our Absolute Fencing Pro-Shop will be open in case you need to replace equipment, or add to your collection. http:\/\/www.absolutefencinggear.com\/\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMen's Epee\r\nY10

There will be foil events for all age groups, plus Y14 Epee. There is also a Y14 Novice Foil event, for fencers who have fenced two tournaments or fewer.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #3\r\nDate(s): 04\/04\/2015\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, April 4th, 2015\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y14 Epee, Y14 Novice Foil\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $15 including tax per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2014-2015 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 Novice event is for fencers who have never fenced a tournament before, or have only fenced one of our Novice events previously. Fencers will need to upgrade their USA Fencing membership to the Competitive version.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2000-2003\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=27729\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/03\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only). \r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 4\/1\/15) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\n***Cash & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2014-2015 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-Lambertville Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 12:00 PM (NOON) check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Restaurants and micro-breweries are varied and plentiful.  The Marriott Denver Tech Center is a brief RTD light rail trip to the Denver Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, the Pepsi Center, Coors Field, the newly opened History Colorado Center, and the Denver Art Museum.  In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly.  REI\u0092s flagship store, with its four story climbing wall, the Downtown Aquarium, and Elitch Gardens amusement park are about 1.3 mile walks from the downtown hotels and RTD stop.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to range a bit further, The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a can\u0092t miss attraction for lovers of all things dinosaur.  Next door to the Museum of Nature and Science is the Denver Zoo.  The new Elephant Passage exhibit recently opened.
