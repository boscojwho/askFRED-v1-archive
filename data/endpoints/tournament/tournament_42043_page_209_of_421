All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they are pre-qualified as described below.)\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  All fencers must be US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\nIf you have already qualified for Div II\/III\/Y14 through another means (see below), you can still attend this event.  You won't \"take up\" a qualification since you are already qualified - instead, you'll help the numbers but will be skipped when awarding qualifications.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule by Weapon -----\r\n\r\nMen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 10:00am Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 12:30pm Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12:30pm Sunday    *** UPDATED TIME ***\r\n\r\nMen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Sunday\r\n\r\nWomen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 10:00am Saturday\r\n\r\nMen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 2:00pm Saturday   *** UPDATED TIME ***\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Saturday\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe registration fee is $20 per event.  \r\n\r\nRegistration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm PDT on Wednesday March 26th.  If you do not register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nEvent fees must be paid at the door.  We accept cash, check (made out to \"WWD\"), and credit cards.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=25623\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nEvents with 14 or fewer fencers will be run as a single round of pools followed by a direct elimination.\r\n\r\nEvents with 15 or more fencers will be run as TWO rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.  The combined results from the two pool rounds will be used to seed the DE tableau.  In events with more than 20 fencers, we will do a cut after the second round of pools based on the number of entries.\r\n\r\nThis two-rounds-of-pools format has proven to be popular with the fencers since it gives everyone a lot of fencing.  It also tends to \"smooth out\" the seeding - if you fence poorly in the first round of pools, you can redeem yourself by fencing well in the second round.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 2000 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 1999 - 2002\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14.  If you qualified for Division I-A at a ROC like the Battle in Seattle, you are already qualified for Div II\/III.  Y14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event.\r\n\r\nThe USFA tracks who has already qualified on the Summer Nationals page on the USFA website.  Check the spreadsheet on that page for your name to see if you are listed as pre-qualified.  If you are unsure, ASK YOUR COACH!\r\n\r\nPre-qualified fencers are still welcome to fence at this event, since it helps the numbers and does not deny someone else a qualifier slot.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict (such as being out of town on business.)  \r\n\r\nContact dberke711@gmail.com for more info on petitions.","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"760 Harrison

If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF. You acknowledge you are entering this tournament at your own risk and release the USA Fencing and its sponsors, BCAF, and referees from any liability.

You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 3\/26\/14.

There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March and\/or July NACs. Y14 winners qualify for Y14 at SN. RYC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE license.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nQualification Path for Y10\/Y12 to the March and July NACs:\r\nFencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the March and July NACs.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nQualification Path to Nationals for Y14 from RYC: \r\nPlace first in the Y14 event at a current-season RYC tournament [BoD, October 2010] In mixed events, only the first place finisher is recognized as qualified.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRegional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be used for RYC events. End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region. Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS. Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List. Each participant gets Region 3 points at this RYC. The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. RYC tournaments will award points to all participants. See the regional guidelines for point allocations at (http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6318\/Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative__1_.pdf). Allocations depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS. \r\n<b>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>REGISTRATION AND EVENT FEES <\/b>\r\n\r\nEntry deadline is March 21.

There is an indoor pool and whirlpool and fitness center.  \r\n\r\nReservation link:  \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/resweb.passkey.com\/Resweb.do?mode=welcome_ei_new&eventID=10893924&utm_source=2092&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=26953282\r\n\r\nPlease make your reservations by March 16th if you wish to take advantage of this rate.\r\n\r\nThe hotel does not provide shuttle service to the airport.

In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly.  REI\u0092s flagship store, with its four story climbing wall, the Downtown Aquarium, and Elitch Gardens amusement park are about 1.3 mile walks from the downtown hotels and RTD stop.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to range a bit further, The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a can\u0092t miss attraction for lovers of all things dinosaur.  Next door to the Museum of Nature and Science is the Denver Zoo.  The new Elephant Passage exhibit recently opened.
