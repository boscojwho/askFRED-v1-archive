Thus we will not have to worry about strips and there will be strips available for any who would like to play with foil.\r\n\r\nThe floor fee is $20 for non-TFC members.\r\n\r\nBeing that children belong to the club we might delay the bringing out of any alcoholic beverages until a little later in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe event will be at TFC on Tuesday August 2nd. \r\n\r\nThe doors will be open at 7; fencing begins at 8\r\n\r\nIf you plan to come, please let us know by preregistering here.

Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Seeding for pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website at the time of the tournament will be used.

Please bring ONE of the following:\r\nA government issued photo ID with date of birth included OR\r\nA COPY of birth certificate, OR\r\nPassport.\r\nThis is not required if birth year has been verified by USFA and your permanent or temporary USFA card indicates:\r\n\u0093Birth Year Verified \u0096 Y\u0094\r\n\r\nNOTE: BIRTH YEAR ELIGIBILITY for events is determined by the 2016-2017 age eligibility schedule, NOT your age at the time of the event.\r\nYouth 10 event 2006-2009\r\nYouth 12 event 2004-2007 or on Youth 10 NRP List\r\nYouth 14 event 2002-2005 or on Youth 12 NRP List\r\n\r\nWe suggest PRIOR TO THIS EVENT, that if the membership card does not indicate \u0093Birth Year Verified \u0096Y\u0094 that you submit a copy of the fencer\u0092s birth certificate or passport to the USA Fencing National Office via mail, email INFORMATION@USFENCING.ORG or FAX, in a timely manner so they may verify the Date of Birth (DOB) and provide an updated membership card.\r\n\r\nWAIVER OF LIABILITY:\r\nA completed waiver form signed by a parent or legal guardian is required. To help speed up the registration process, please DOWNLOAD the waiver form, print it, read it, sign it, and bring it to the table with you. This is extremely important if the fencer does not have a parent\/guardian at check in. NO ONE WILL BE ALLOWED TO FENCE WITHOUT A SIGNED WAIVER\/Acknowledgement FORM. Click \u0093Download Waiver\u0094.\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY, FILMING, RECORDING or any other form of media of the athletes during the tournament can be used by the organizer (BFC and Maryland Division) and the USFA. Reference waiver form to opt out of this authorization.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nThe format for MARYLAND RYC Region 6 events is one round of pools with 100% of the fencers promoted to a direct elimination table. Details can be found in the Rulebook and Athlete Handbook at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695205-manuals\r\n\r\nOn-line tournament results: Live real-time posting of seeding, pool and strip assignments and results. Live tournament feed: http:\/\/ .com. (On Smartphones with BFC free Wi-Fi ). Note: prior to tournament any posted seeding is preliminary and NOT official.\r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\nSeeding is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter rankings, then by classification year. Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves. http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/5402\/Regional_Recognition_Initiative_Information_Document_2015-2016_-3.9.15.pdf\r\n\r\nRYC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USFA in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by organizers from USFA. This information will be downloaded on Wednesday, August 3, 2016. Check your current points at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. Fencers should verify their ratings prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USA Fencing. Only an official e-mail response from USA Fencing will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website.\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the bout committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS\r\nSAFETY AND EQUIPMENT POLICY\r\nRYC events are run in accordance with USFA rules and formats.\r\n\r\nFull fencing uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron, fencing knickers, knee length socks and glove. Additionally, chest protectors are required for girls. All USFA uniform requirements apply. Conductive bibs are required for foil fencers.\r\n\r\nEach fencer is required to have two working electric weapons, and two working body cords. Foil and saber fencers need two working mask cords and saber fencers must have over-glove conductive sleeves.\r\n\r\nALL Y10 fencers will be required to use size \u00930\u0094 or size \u00932\u0094 blades (less than 32.5 inches long). Blades labeled as \u00930\u0094 or \u00932\u0094 but are longer than 32.5 inches are not permitted.\r\n\r\nNames on uniforms are not required for RYC tournaments.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT CHECKS\r\nDuring the initial equipment inspection at check in, lames, masks, gloves, saber overgloves, body and mask cords, as well as any French grip weapons will be tested and marked (Stamp on mask, colored tape or other mark on cords) to show they pass inspection.\r\n\r\nMasks that do not pass the 12 kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is NOT APPROVED FOR USE.\r\n\r\nEquipment (using weights and shims) and uniforms will be inspected upon reporting to the strip for the pool round and each direct elimination bout to ensure the presence of underarm plastron, second weapon and cords, and weapon control marks.\r\n\r\nFailure to appear when called and with approved regulation equipment will subject fencer to penalties as defined by USFA rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nNote that vendors and armorers may be available to repair equipment for a fee per basis if time permits; but it is the ultimate responsibility of the fencer to have all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment checks on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly. \r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED\r\nSingle gender events may be combined if there are insufficient fencers within an age category. There must be FEWER THAN 5 ENTRIES IN ONE GENDER for the event to be combined. Fencers may only compete in one event per day (extraordinary exceptions require Bout Committee approval.)\r\n\r\nEvent schedule times may be changed depending on entries. Rely on email communication.\r\n\r\nIf there are six or fewer fencers in a gender specific competition and there is an opposite gender-specific competition in the same weapon on that day the two may be combined for one mixed competition. For competitions that have more than six fencers in each gender specific competition, the competitions shall remain separate.\r\n\r\nNOTE THAT ALL TIMES POSTED REPRESENT THE CLOSE OF CHECK-IN for the event. If all fencers for an event have checked in early, that event may start early (given availability of strips, referees, and readiness of the fencers to begin.)\r\n\r\nFencing usually commences approximately 20 minutes after the close of check in. Start times are subject to change- check ASKFred for details. It is recommended that fencers arrive at least one hour prior to close of check-in times. This should provide sufficient time to register and have equipment checked and be properly warmed up. If all fencers for an event have checked in early, the event may start early depending on the availability of strips, referees, and readiness of the fencers to begin.\r\n\r\nBFC doors open at 8:00 a.m. or one hour prior to close of registration.\r\n\r\nFencers must check in each day they compete within the indicated hours of check-in. Fencers who fail to check in before the published close of check in time will be removed from the event, and there will be NO entry fee refunds issued.\r\n\r\nAWARDS AND RECOGNITION\r\nAwards\r\nThere will be separate awards for the top 8 places if an event has 8+ fencers. If an age event is combined because there are fewer than 5 entries of one gender, medals will be awarded without distinction based upon the gender of any fencer- only the final placement in the event. Come prepared with bio information including your top three best fencing results and information for your local newspaper(s).\r\n\r\nAwards ceremonies will follow the National format. All award winners report to the awards presentation area immediately after the gold medal final bout for the event, wearing club uniform (warm ups) or fencing whites. (No shorts, flip flops, spandex, hats are permitted.) Please use your best judgment as you represent your club and are showing respect to the sport and participants.\r\n\r\nRegional recognition:\r\nAll region 6 athletes shall earn Regional Points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Please consult the Regional Recognition Initiative document at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources for details.\r\n\r\nSanctioned RYC tournaments serve as a qualifying path for Youth North American Cup and Summer National Championships. Please refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook for information on Youth Qualifying paths. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook .\r\n\r\nClassification changes will be awarded according to USFA rules. In applicable age groups, the competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification based on final results. Please refer to the USFA classification chart for more information.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS:\r\nNearest airport: Baltimore\/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport\r\nBWI (approximately 10 miles away from venue).\r\n\r\nNearby Hotels:\r\nHampton Inn Columbia\r\nSonesta ES Suites Columbia MD\r\nHampton Inn & Suites Columbia\/South\r\n\r\nFENCING BAG STORAGE\r\nFencing bags will not be allowed on the fencing floor. Please store fencing bags in the designated Bag Storage Area. The venue is not responsible for theft or damage to unattended equipment.\r\n\r\nCONDUCT POLICY\r\nZero tolerance for poor conduct. This applies to every person in the venue. Staff members and volunteers deserve respect and appreciation. USFA rules and penalties shall apply and be strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nPHOTOGRAPHY\r\nSpectators are encouraged to capture the fencing moment; however, spectator seating in the piste space is limited, so please be sensitive to the needs of the fencers. NO FLASH photography is permitted near ongoing competitions.\r\n\r\nUSFA RESOURCES:\r\nWe recognize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event.

These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register.

It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Novice Level events will be seeded at Random. Intermediate events will be seeded utilizing the Intermediate Series Points list. Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 12 attendees)\r\n3:00 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 12 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\n<b>The purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:<\/b>\r\n<ul><li>Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament<ul><li>signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n<li>what to bring to a tournament<\/ul><\/ul><ul><li>Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols <ul><li>registration <li>the importance of warming up<li>saluting opponents and referees<li>keeping score on a pool sheet\r\n<li>how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round<li>good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates)<li>shaking hands during the awards ceremony<li>not using a flash while taking pictures<li>appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?<\/ul><\/ul><ul><li>Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n<li>Show basic referee hand signals\r\n<li>Train new referees and bout committee <\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>The purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to<\/b>:<ul><li>Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n<li>Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n<li>Introduce fencers to complete armoury inspection\r\n<li>Explain how to properly maintain one\u0092s equipment\r\n<li>Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n<li>Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists<\/ul>\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nWe will hold six of these between August 2016 and June 2017, and the points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes).

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/3\/16.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/17\/16. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 8\/17\/16) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Membership\r\nexceptions for foreign fencers do apply. Athletes without proof of membership must complete\r\ncompetitive membership registration prior to competing.\r\nParents\/guardians should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age\r\nneeds verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to\r\ninformation@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nTo avoid bringing this documentation, USA Fencing has an age verification process.\r\nCurrent Verification Process:\r\nAn athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via\r\nemail (information@usfencing.org), mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the\r\ndatabase. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and\r\ntemporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nSEEDING:\r\nROC:\r\nSeeding: Seeding shall be based on the following order:\r\n1. Classification and year\r\n2. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who\r\nare seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\n Seeding should be based on the following order:\r\n&#61623; National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n&#61623; Classification and year\r\n&#61623; If athlete has neither National Points nor a weapon classification they are seeded on a random\r\nbasis with the other athletes in the same situation\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\n Seeding should be based on the following order:\r\n&#61623; Current National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n&#61623; Classification and year\r\n&#61623; Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who\r\nare seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS:\r\n\r\nROC:\r\n Competitions award regional points to the top 40%, rounding up, in the field.\r\nUp to the best 3 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional\r\nRank each season.\r\nAthletes may earn points at ROCs in any region.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for regional points. Points earned in a ROC tournament only appear in\r\nthe category in which they were earned. (For example: Div 1A do NOT trickle down to Div 2).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION between Div 1A and Div 2\/Div 3. Therefore, if a\r\nfencer qualifies in Div 1A and is age and classification eligible for Div 2 (Div 3), they earn\r\nqualification in that category as well. \r\n\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will\r\nearn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn\r\nregional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn\r\nqualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For more information on this Regional Points formula\r\nsee the Regional Recognition Initiative Document available http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources\r\nUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional Rank\r\neach season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior\r\ntournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional\r\npoints do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an\r\nolder age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as\r\nwell. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet,\r\nhe\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events.\r\nJunior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are also only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and\r\nJunior Olympic\/National Championships. \r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nRYC:\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RYC is\r\nheld will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their\r\nregion will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A\r\npercentage of athletes (Y12\/Y14) will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For\r\nmore information on this Regional Points formula see the Regional Recognition Initiative\r\nDocument available on http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources.\r\nUp to the best 3 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional\r\nRank each season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional\r\nYouth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12\r\nregional points do NOT trickle down to Y10).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer\r\nqualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn\r\nqualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the National\r\nChampionships in Y14 and is age eligible for Y12, he\/she will also qualify in Y12)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RYC events.\r\n(Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC\r\nto a maximum of 64 fencers and, depending on the size of the competitive field, to the top 32\r\nor 64 fencers (depending on field size) at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS:\r\nROC:\r\nThe ROC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Div 1A, Div 2, Div 3 and Veteran USA\r\nFencing National Championships.\r\nFor more information on ROC qualification paths refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook and the qualification table available under the\r\n\u0093Qualification\u0094 tab at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjccresources.\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\nThe RJCC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Cadet and Junior fencers to the Junior Olympic\r\nNational Championships and the USA Fencing Summer Nationals July Challenge.\r\nA percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National\r\nChampionships and for the Junior Olympic Championships in Junior and Cadet.\r\nFor more information on Cadet and Junior qualification paths refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook and the qualification table available under the \u0093Qualification\u0094\r\ntab on the RJCC resources page at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjccresources.\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth\r\nNAC and for Y10\/12 and 14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\nA percentage of regional point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer\r\nNational Championships in Y12 and Y14.

RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the\r\nregular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the\r\nYouth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATIONS:\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the\r\nscoring of touches is used.
