If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**Mailing Address for All Locations**\r\n- P.O.

You must be an active member of Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Kitsap Fencing Club, or Washington Fencing Academy to participate.\r\n\r\nA current 2017-2018 membership to the US Fencing Association (non-competitive membership is fine) is also required for this event due to insurance and liability requirements.\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: Jack Sparrow In-House Foil and Epee Tournament\r\nDate: May 26, 2018\r\nClose of Registration: 10:00 AM\r\nLocation: Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Tacoma, WA\r\n\r\nWe are right next to Olympus Women's Health Club and across the street from H-Mart. Our address is 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 10:00 AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $25 for the event.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE DISCOUNTS (may be combined): $5 off if preregistered on AskFRED because everyone should use AskFRED, $5 off for fencers with a classification (rating) as we want to encourage our most experienced members to participate as well and be role models for our beginners, and $5 off for rated referees who will help referee during this event.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. Adults and children with all different levels of experience will be fencing together. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (our Mateys will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Anyone trying to fence in flip flops or shorts will walk the plank.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nBeginners are welcome to use club electric equipment. Competitive fencers are expected to use their own equipment. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools and a direct elimination round with 100% promoted.\r\n\r\nThere is a special twist for scurvy pirates. You will be issued a Nerf gun with a limited number of shots. If you successfully shoot your opponent during a bout it counts as an automatic touch. But be forewarned. You have a limited number of shots for the whole tournament. Pirates, shoot their opponent's booty to help win tournament booty. Referees may also be issued Nerf guns and may shoot you (giving your opponent a point) if you start a mutiny on the plank.\r\n\r\nIf less than 8 people are signed up for Epee by Friday, May 25, the two events will be combined into Foil only.  \r\n\r\nREFEREEING\r\n\r\nThe rounds will be self-directed by fencers who are rated referees and claim their $5 discount.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU\r\nSpecial thanks to Buzz Bee Toys for donating the Air Warriors GEM Dart Guns for use at our event.

or later\r\nY14 = birth year 2003 or later\r\nCadet = birth year 2001 or later\r\nJunior = birth year 1998 or later\r\n\r\nTournament Structure:\r\nAll times are close of registration, fencing to commence immediately afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a stoppage at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events will be sanctioned and require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nY8, Y10 and Y12 events require a minimum of 4 fencers.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events require a minimum of 6 fencers for sanctioning.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of fencers of each gender.\r\n\r\nFees:\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\nTournament Rules:\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\nCFF Licenses:\r\nAll participating fencers will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\nFencing Equipment:\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 5\/23\/18. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).<\/b>\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n<b>$50 at the door for late registrations (after 5\/23\/18) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY). <\/b>\r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>**Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs. Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated. If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get good with blade-work. Visualize every bout starting with you being backed up to the end of the strip. Try it - you'll like it! Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.   \r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Utah Swords Academy Fencing Club","address":"3536 South West Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","zip":"84115","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":40.6945331,"longitude":-111.8949921,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":12,"name":"Utah-Southern Idaho","abbrev":"UT-SID","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":158504,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed CANCELLED Any-Age, Walk & Roll Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"CANCELLED Any-Age, Walk & Roll","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158505,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed CANCELLED Any-Age, Walk & Roll Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"CANCELLED Any-Age, Walk & Roll","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158506,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Any-Age, Walk and Roll Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"Any-Age, Walk and Roll","close_of_reg":"2018-06-02T11:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158507,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y8 Mixed CANCELLED Saber","short_name":"Y8MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"CANCELLED","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158508,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y10 Mixed CANCELLED Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"CANCELLED","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158509,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed COMBINED W\/ Y14 Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"COMBINED W\/ Y14","close_of_reg":"2018-06-02T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158510,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed COMBINED W\/ Y12 Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"COMBINED W\/ Y12","close_of_reg":"2018-06-02T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158511,"tournament_id":39837,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #10, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Senior Mixed CANCELLED Sanctioned DIV1A Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"CANCELLED Sanctioned DIV1A","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":38321,"name":"Freehold Fencing's Div II Epee","start_date":"2018-06-01","end_date":"","comments":"Div2 Mixed  Epee start at 6:00 pm.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2003-2006\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=38282\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/01\/2018\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
