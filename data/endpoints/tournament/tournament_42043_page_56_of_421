If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.

There will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the\r\n\r\nUSFA 2008-2009 age requirements:\r\nYouth-8: born in 2000-2003\r\nYouth-10: born in 1998-2001\r\nYouth-12: born in 1996-1999\r\nYouth-14: born in 1994-1997\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Youth Progressive #4 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8. Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil,\r\nYouth-12 Foil,Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.\r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1. Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event. If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2. Events are mixed (boys and girls). Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender. (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3. Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments. Point standings will be posted at http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4. The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series. For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"NorthWest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Aveue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.48434,"longitude":-122.782564,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":28964,"tournament_id":6402,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-10-18T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":28965,"tournament_id":6402,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-10-18T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":28966,"tournament_id":6402,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-10-18T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":28967,"tournament_id":6402,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-10-18T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":28968,"tournament_id":6402,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":28969,"tournament_id":6402,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-10-18T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6924,"name":"High Desert Duel","start_date":"2008-10-18","end_date":"2008-10-19","comments":"The High Desert Duel in Bend Oregon is back in the fall.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"waiting\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Waiting list policy:<\/b>\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"policy\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nYouth Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/18\/2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30750,"tournament_id":6862,"tournament":"Novice Youth","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-10-19T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":31917,"tournament_id":6862,"tournament":"Novice Youth","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6607,"name":"NEUSFA - Mixed Sabre Round Robin @ Moe FC","start_date":"2008-10-19","end_date":"","comments":"Mixed Sabre Round Robin (Y14+). $30 total - $10 with AskFred Prereg., $20 more at the door.

The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or higher are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.

The purpose of these events is to allow youths to gain experience in larger \"USFA-style\" competitions without having to travel out of their local region. At each RYC, events will be held in all three weapons (foil, epee, and sabre).  For each weapon and age category, awards will be given to the the top three boys and top three girls.  For Y10 and Y12 fencers, attending an RYC will qualify that individual for the Summer Nationals (in the respective event and age category that they fenced in).      \r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current USFA members. You must bring your membership card, or become a USFA Member at the door. Full USFA uniform is required, including mask, jacket, plastron, fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove.  Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or sabre, as appropriate), and two working body cords.  All Y10 fencers will be required to use size \"0\" or size \"2\" blades (i.e., less than 32.5 inches long).\r\n\r\nEquipment checks are conducted at RYC events.  Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lame's are in good working order.  Limited types of replacement equipment are available at NWFC (Beaverton) - please call NWFC  for availability. Please ensure that your equipment is in good working order prior to the event.\r\n   \r\n Age Requirements: \r\n\r\nY10: Birth years of 1998 - 2001\r\n\r\nY12: Birth years of 1996 - 1999\r\n\r\nY14: Birth years of 1994 - 1997\r\n \r\nEach event is $10.00.
