Please plan to arrive at least 15 minutes before your check-in time.\r\n\r\n------------------  COVID Policy: ------------------- \r\n\r\nPer King County's mandate, we will require proof of vaccination or a negative COVID test result for all fencers 12 and older, as well as anyone else over 12 who will stay on site more than a few minutes.\r\n\r\nYou may email a photo of your vaccination card to tournaments@raincityfencing.com, or show it at the front desk when you check in. We will record the vaccination confirmation in an internal. (We will not save any images of vaccination cards.) We will accept proof of at least the first dose as sufficient.\r\n\r\nIf you already verified vaccination status for our RJCC\/ROC tournament in September or the RYC in October, we have that recorded, so you do not need to send it again. If not, you may submit this information before the event if you like.\r\n\r\nAnyone 12 or older who is not vaccinated will need to show a negative PCR test result from within 72 hours. The King County mandate does not allow us to accept self-administered rapid test results.\r\n\r\nThis requirement does not apply to anyone who is only in the building briefly (picking up, dropping off, or making a quick equipment purchase).\r\n\r\nKids under 12 are not required to provide a test result.\r\n\r\nEveryone in the venue must wear a face mask at all times (except when drinking water during a DE break), including under the fencing mask.\r\n\r\n------------------  Event Details: ------------------- \r\n\r\nEvents may be fenced mixed or boys and girls separate, depending on number of entries. Format will be pools of 5 and 6, 100% promotion to direct elimination, with medals for the top 4.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $30 per event. RCFC members: if you would prefer to have the entry fee billed to your account, let us know and we will add the bill to your account.\r\n\r\nEntries are limited to 30 fencers per event, so pre-register early! If you register but cannot attend, please cancel as soon as possible to let others in.\r\n\r\nCurrent (2021-2022) USA Fencing membership is required. A Competitive membership or the new Access level membership is sufficient. If necessary, please join or renew online at https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ before the event, to speed up check-in.\r\n\r\nAll fencers and spectators must wear face coverings at all times, including while fencing, regardless of vaccination status. The exception is while drinking water during a DE break. Fencers are required to salute after each bout, but may tap blades in lieu of a handshake.\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants and long socks, is required.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale. Epee fencers may not use a foil or saber mask with any conductive surface.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use an FIE-approved padded protector. We have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.\r\n\r\nAge eligibility:\r\n\r\nYouth-8: born 2013-2016\r\nYouth-10: born 2011-2014\r\nYouth-12: born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-14: born 2007-2010\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=48796\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/05\/2021\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":190186,"tournament_id":48796,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-11-06T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":190187,"tournament_id":48796,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":24,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-11-07T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":190188,"tournament_id":48796,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":29,"prereg_count":29,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-11-06T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":190189,"tournament_id":48796,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-11-06T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":190190,"tournament_id":48796,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":30,"prereg_count":32,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-11-07T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":49056,"name":"Friends of DCFC Saturday Night Y14 Mixed Epee","start_date":"2021-11-06","end_date":"","comments":"Join us at DCFC for our Saturday Night Mixed Epee Y14 Event.

Winners usually can win small prizes.  For the last few Saturdays, winners were awarded Allstar-Uhlmann tournament socks.  While waiting for their turn, kids are encouraged to sit in the same general area, socialize, and have fun!\r\n\r\nOnce this event gets big enough, larger prizes will be awarded.  And, winners' names will be published in the Patch, the Star-Ledger, and other publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Background Information.<\/b>  With the increased number of fencing clubs these days, young fencers have found some difficulty finding similarly aged or skilled opponents at their clubs.  COVID has made this worse as some classes have gone from 20 kids to 4.  Many fencers have turned to tournaments to overcome these shortcomings but they have some drawbacks.  Fencers wait long times to fence with only a limited number of bouts.  They can also be overly competitive and stressful.  The costs can also be prohibitive.\r\n\r\nThis weekly fencing event attempts to remedy this.  It brings kids from all over NJ and NY to come together and just fence for fun.  It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter what club you are affiliated with as it is open to all.\r\n\r\nMany fencing coaches have expressed concern that this is an attempt to poach their students.  This is not the case.  To let you know, I am a father who is simply creating a venue for his 2 middle-school children to have fun fencing.  I am not affiliated with NJFA or any other club.  I don't get paid for this as the $5 daily fee directly goes to NJFA for facility usage.  I firmly believe that private lessons at your fencing club are essential for becoming a good fencer so please do not quit your club, thinking this event is sufficient for your growth!\r\n\r\nThis event also will not derail your coach's technique.  If this was true, then official tournaments would be harmful as well.  The more you practice, the better you become.  The more varied opponents you practice against, the more experience you gain.  This is what this weekly meet aims to accomplish in an enjoyable atmosphere.  Instead of fencing the same practice partners at your local club, you get to fence kids from all over the NY metro area.  You'll get to meet people with many different styles and various levels of skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cost.<\/b>  $5 per visit (which is really cheap!).  The first time is free so you can try it out.  Venmo, Zelle, or other alternative payment options are available.  (My Venmo is @EdwinKim777.)  If you would like to donate, please do so.  I'll put the extra money into bigger prizes!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Help Wanted.<\/b>  I would love any help regarding this activity.  If you would like to officiate bouts or help oversee things, please let me know.  When I fenced in high school, Masters was the largest and the most successful club.  It succeeded because the kids had a lot of fun.  This made them want to come more often, which in turn made them better fencers.

There are a number of food options near our club.\r\n\r\nCOVID Compliance: Event is capped at 30 total fencers.\r\nAll fencers must register upon arrival and certify that they and their parent answer negative to the COVID screening questions. Fencers and their parent will have their temperature screened upon arrival. Any fencer or guest who has been exposed to COVID or is feeling ill should stay home.  \r\n\r\nFencers and their parent must wear a USA fencing approved mask at all times while at the tournament both inside and outside. The only exception is that fencers may lower their mask for a water break while stationary and at least 6 feet from others. Per USA Fencing, face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and inserts that clip into the fencing mask and do not fully contact the athlete's face are not permitted. Fencers and parents who arrive without an approved mask will be offered a surgical mask.\r\n\r\nThere will be no eating inside the tournament area (indoors or outdoors) and masks may be removed for water breaks only when stationary and maintaining 6 feet of distancing.\r\n\r\nMinor aged fencers may have one parent or adult accompany them to the event.  Non-Fencers will be asked to watch from outside through the large picture windows.  Dress warmly!  \r\n\r\nThe awards ceremony will be brief and held outdoors for safety.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules -------------------\r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current access or competitive members of the USFA for the 2021-2022 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership. Go to http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership to join.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, lame, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Chest protectors are required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations.

Please email edwinkim777@gmail.com to register.*\r\n\r\n\r\nMini-tournaments are held every Saturday.  Starts with a round-robin round followed by direct elimination.  Winners usually can win small prizes.  For the last few Saturdays, winners were awarded Allstar-Uhlmann tournament socks.  While waiting for their turn, kids are encouraged to sit in the same general area, socialize, and have fun!\r\n\r\nOnce this event gets big enough, larger prizes will be awarded.  And, winners' names will be published in the Patch, the Star-Ledger, and other publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Background Information.<\/b>  With the increased number of fencing clubs these days, young fencers have found some difficulty finding similarly aged or skilled opponents at their clubs.  COVID has made this worse as some classes have gone from 20 kids to 4.  Many fencers have turned to tournaments to overcome these shortcomings but they have some drawbacks.  Fencers wait long times to fence with only a limited number of bouts.  They can also be overly competitive and stressful.  The costs can also be prohibitive.\r\n\r\nThis weekly fencing event attempts to remedy this.  It brings kids from all over NJ and NY to come together and just fence for fun.  It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter what club you are affiliated with as it is open to all.\r\n\r\nMany fencing coaches have expressed concern that this is an attempt to poach their students.  This is not the case.  To let you know, I am a father who is simply creating a venue for his 2 middle-school children to have fun fencing.  I am not affiliated with NJFA or any other club.  I don't get paid for this as the $5 daily fee directly goes to NJFA for facility usage.  I firmly believe that private lessons at your fencing club are essential for becoming a good fencer so please do not quit your club, thinking this event is sufficient for your growth!\r\n\r\nThis event also will not derail your coach's technique.  If this was true, then official tournaments would be harmful as well.  The more you practice, the better you become.  The more varied opponents you practice against, the more experience you gain.  This is what this weekly meet aims to accomplish in an enjoyable atmosphere.  Instead of fencing the same practice partners at your local club, you get to fence kids from all over the NY metro area.  You'll get to meet people with many different styles and various levels of skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cost.<\/b>  $5 per visit (which is really cheap!).  The first time is free so you can try it out.  Venmo, Zelle, or other alternative payment options are available.  (My Venmo is @EdwinKim777.)  If you would like to donate, please do so.  I'll put the extra money into bigger prizes!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Help Wanted.<\/b>  I would love any help regarding this activity.  If you would like to officiate bouts or help oversee things, please let me know.  When I fenced in high school, Masters was the largest and the most successful club.  It succeeded because the kids had a lot of fun.  This made them want to come more often, which in turn made them better fencers.  Help me replicate that same environment here.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested or have additional questions, please feel free to email me at edwinkim777@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEddie","venue":{"name":"NJFA","address":"","city":"Maplewood","state":"NJ","zip":"07040","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7312956,"longitude":-74.2707509,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":189332,"tournament_id":48562,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":189333,"tournament_id":48562,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":189334,"tournament_id":48562,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":48834,"name":"ISU Cantaloupe","start_date":"2021-11-13","end_date":"2021-11-14","comments":"Registration is $15 plus $5 per event.\r\nFirst place for each event receives a cantaloupe, second gets an orange, third gets a banana, and anyone who iron mans the tournament receives a mango.","prereg_open":"2021-09-14","prereg_close":"2021-11-14","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Welcome to ISUFC's fourteenth annual Cantaloupe, the first of our two annual tournaments.

Proof of age is required if USA Fencing Membership card does not show \"Age Verified\".\r\n\r\n<b>COVID Protocol:<\/b>\r\n\r\nEveryone in the venue must wear a surgical or double cloth mask covering nose and mouth at all times when in the venue including while fencing. Anyone entering the building must allow their temperature to be scanned at the door.\r\n\r\nIn order to keep all persons safe, each fencer is allowed a maximum of one (1) guardian in attendance in addition to their coach. Parent\/guardian must remain in designated area. No exceptions. Only coaches (those with a Current USA Coach Membership) and fencers will be allowed on the fencing floor during pool rounds.\r\n\r\nYou must abide by and comply with all safety measures required by the tournament organizer. Anyone (fencer or guardian) refusing to comply with safety protocols will be escorted from the venue. If you cannot comply do not register for this tournament. Protocols will include, but are not limited, to the following:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Self-monitor and be symptom-free for at least 10 days prior to tournament. Stay home if you have had close sustained contact in last 10 days with anyone who was sick or known or believed to have COVID-19. Stay home if you are sick or do not feel well. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Wash and sanitize all your fencing equipment. Consult the manufacturer for proper cleaning instructions to avoid possible damage to equipment. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fencers should come to the tournament already dressed in freshly washed fencing uniform. Changing in bathrooms will not be permitted, so you will need to come dressed to be able to comfortably change in other areas (socially distanced in the venue or outdoors). \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Everyone in the venue must wear a surgical or cloth mask covering nose and mouth, even under fencing masks, except when drinking or eating. We ask parents to please go outside if eating - fencers may have a snack inside. Mask must cover nose and mouth. There is no exception to this requirement. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Everyone must practice social distancing. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Guardians must remain in designated seating areas off the fencing floor. Fencers should be comfortable with basic tournament procedures (including how to hook up) and troubleshooting, as no one besides athletes, officials, coaches (current USA Fencing coach membership required) will be allowed on the fencing floor. Tournament staff will be on the fencing floor in case some assistance is needed. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 All warm-up activity must be done in designated areas. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Refrain from contacting other participants and attendees (handshakes, body contact, etc.) \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your elbow if you cough or sneeze. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Avoid touching your face, eyes or mouth with unclean hands. \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Do not share equipment such as weapons, body cords, fencing masks, gloves or uniforms, with
