Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73946,"tournament_id":17578,"tournament":"Y12 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-11T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16313,"name":"St. Valentine Massacre USFA Sectional Event","start_date":"2012-02-11","end_date":"","comments":"This is a USFA Indiana Division Great Lakes Sectional event to take place at Culver High School.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73950,"tournament_id":17582,"tournament":"Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":15,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-12T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15536,"name":"Open Mixed Aged Teams","start_date":"2012-02-12","end_date":"","comments":"Come fence a team event.\r\nAll teams will be picked at random 30 minutes before close of registration.\r\nEach team will be composed of a youth, senior and vet fencer\r\nUSFA rules apply","prereg_open":"2011-07-25","prereg_close":"2012-02-11","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":15,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"All USA rules apply\r\nUSFA membership required - one day membership acceptable.\r\nA team will consist of three fencers in one weapon.\r\nEach team will be pulled from a mask 30 minutes befor the close of registration.
