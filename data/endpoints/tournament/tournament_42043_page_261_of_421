If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 1\/27\/16. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 1\/27\/16) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>**Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Have the cab take Observer Highway West and turn left on Grove St. The Lackawanna Warehouse is on the right-hand side between 18th and 16th St. \r\n\r\n PARKING INFORMATION: \r\n To avoid possibility of your car being towed, note these parking instructions:\r\n\r\n Parking is available in lot directly across street and also the parking lot at the southwest corner of 18th\/Grove Streets. Once the main parking lot is filled there are 3 other parking locations:\r\n 1. You can park nose into the cyclone fence on 16th Street between Grove St. and Marin Blvd. DO NOT park in front of the sliding gate however.\r\n 2. There is a parking lot at the corner of Grove Street and 18th St.\r\n 3. You can go up the ramp located on Marin Blvd between 18th and 16th street. DO NOT block access to the truck bays. Stay to the right. If you are parking here we suggest you drop off your fencer with a parent to check in. It's about a 10 minute walk down the ramp and around the block to the Lackawanna Warehouse.\r\n\r\n If you arrive at Cobra and are unable to find parking either in the lot directly across the street, nose in along the fence on 16th Street between Grove and Marin (excluding the sliding gate entrance which is marked with cones), or the parking lot on the corner of 18th Street and Grove St. you should:\r\n 1. Drop off your fencer and a parent at the building entrance with their equipment so they can go up to the fourth floor and check in. \r\n 2. Drive to the corner of Grove St and 18th St. Turn left and proceed about 200 yards until you see a yellow post at an open entrance on the left. You can turn in and park as long as you stay well right. Do not block any truck bays or construction areas. Do not go left into The Cake Boss\u0092s parking area.

Here is a link to a campus map: https:\/\/www.jmu.edu\/parking\/_files\/parkingmap.pdf\r\n\r\nWe suggest parking in lots: G, C9, or P. The location where we will be fencing on the map is labeled University Recreation Center. Follow the path through \"Duke Dog Alley\". It is a tunnel that will lead you to the gym. Since it is basketball season, parking in lots by the Convocation Center is off-limits. (There will be a basketball game Sunday afternoon at 3PM.) Do not park in Convo lots E and B or else you will get a ticket. But Convo lot F will be available to park in as well.\r\n\r\nUREC has recently went under some construction, so for those of you who have been there before, getting to the gym will be a bit different. When you walk through the main door, you will see the rock wall. Behind the rock wall is a staircase. Take the staircase to the second floor, and keep going straight. Follow the signs to the UREC Crossroads (Through the old gym). When you exit the gym, turn left and follow the hallway all the way to the end to MAC 3 Gym. There will be signs.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Mixed Epee\r\nMixed Epee\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\nMixed Foil\r\nD & Under Mixed Saber\r\nMixed Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens

We're honoring the life of this superstar with a tournament that's equally weird.  This tournament will be like nothing you've ever fenced in before, and guarantees EVERY fencer lots of fencing and equal number of bouts.  Are you ready to \"turn and face the strange\"?\r\n\r\nSince this is a modified format, it is unsanctioned and rating cannot be given.  However, this also means that USA Fencing Memberships are not required, so anyone and everyone can join us for a great day of fencing!\r\n\r\nThe \"Weird\" Format\r\n-----------------------\r\n(This example is based on a 20 person tournament)\r\n\r\nInitially there will be two rounds of 4 pools of 5 fencers. These small pools should allow the competition to progress quickly and keep hanging around to a minimum. There is no elimination after either round of pools, all fencers proceed to the next stage of the competition. This is where things get weird.\r\n\r\nInstead of the conventional direct elimination table, all fencers are promoted into a final pool based on their results from the pools.  Fencers seeded 1-10 are placed into Final Pool A, fencers seeded 11-20 are placed in Final Pool B. All fencers in each pool will fence each other to 5 touches using the same rules as a traditional pool bout.  Fencers in Final Pool A will earn places 1-10 and fencers in Final Pool B will earn places 11-20.\r\n\r\nThe results will be calculated by the fencer with the most victories, then highest indicators, then hits scored. If two fencers are tied after these parameters then the result of the fight between the two fencers in question will decide the position.\r\n\r\nThis competition is designed to give the maximum fencing experience.  Each fencer will fence the same number of fights irrespective of their final position. In addition to this, each Final Pool bout should be highly competitive as the more skilled fencers will be placed in Final Pool A and the less experienced fencers placed in Final Pool B depending on their results in the earlier pools. This should prevent easy fights for the more skilled fencers and whitewashes for the less skilled fencers.\r\n\r\nThe number of fencers in each initial round of pools, the number of Final Pools and the numbers in each Final Pool are subject to change and each Final Pool may have differing numbers of fencers. The exact numbers and format cannot be confirmed until after check in has closed. Therefore the examples given above are for an ideal number and should be taken as a guide The exact number of bouts cannot be guaranteed. This competition format CAN guarantee much more fencing than the traditional open.\r\n\r\nNow that you understand the format, sign up, and Let's Fence!\r\n\r\n\u0093I don't know where I'm going from here, but I promise it won't be boring.\u0094 \r\n&#8213; David Bowie\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/18\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/06\/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.174205,"longitude":-86.662146,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":128378,"tournament_id":32512,"tournament":"Let's Fence: A David Bowie Tribute Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":16,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-07T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":32513,"name":"GFA Youth foil & sabre","start_date":"2016-02-07","end_date":"","comments":"$35 paid pre registration.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 2\/3\/16.

THANK YOU!\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nUSFA MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED (GET IT BEFORE February 5, 2016)\r\n\r\nThe Central California Division Y14 Summer National Qualifiers are only open to USFA members registered in the Central California Division. Proof of membership is required. You may verify your membership and division affiliation at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nPlease resolve any division issues directly with USFA on or before Friday, February 5, 2016 so we can verify your eligibility. If you are a new member, you should be aware that you may compete in the division within which you live or the division within which your affiliated club is located.\r\n\r\nUSFA NATIONAL QUALIFIERS ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nAthletes are permitted to fence in their Division qualifying competitions only IF:\r\n1) The athlete is a U.S. citizen OR permanent resident and a current COMPETITIVE member of USA FENCING with an expiration date of 7\/31\/2016 or later AND\r\n2) The athlete is a member of that division AND\r\n3) The athlete represents the United States in international competition AND\r\n4) The athlete's birth year falls in that age bracket OR\r\n5) The athlete is on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket\r\n\r\nAny fencer who is a citizen or permanent resident who has represented another country in the last three years is NOT eligible for any Junior Olympic Fencing Championships competition, individual or team, including corresponding Division qualifying competitions. A foreign fencer who is in the US on a visa is NOT eligible to fence in any National Championships or the Division qualifying competition.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENT FEE STRUCTURE:\r\n\r\n$40 per event if pre-registered on or before 2\/05\/2016\r\n\r\n$80 per event walk-in registration\r\n\r\nWe will allow walk-in registrations at the penalty rate of $80 per event. This will be allowed at the bout committee\u0092s discretion. We will not allow walk-ins if we cannot verify the fencer\u0092s eligibility from the information we download from USFA fencing on Friday 2\/05\/2016. If an event has been cancelled because there were three or fewer pre-registrants, we will not allow walk-ins.\r\n\r\nFees are payable by CASH or CHECK ONLY.\r\nCheck made payable to Central California Division USFA.\r\nWe DO NOT take credit or debit cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINING THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIERS:\r\n\r\nThe number of qualifiers is 25% of the entrants, ROUNDED UP (e.g. 13 fencers = 4 qualifiers) with a minimum of three. If there are three or fewer pre-registrants we will try to contact you. Unless we tell you before the tournament that the event is cancelled, you will need to come, however you might not need to fence. We will not cancel any event before the end of the late preregistration period.\r\n\r\nQualification paths are listed in Chapter 2 of the Athlete Handbook.\r\n\r\nIf the last qualifying spot is tied, there must be a fence off to determine qualification. \r\nFor regional qualifiers, if there is only one entrant the qualifier will not count and the fencer should use an alternate qualification path.\r\n\r\n*Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed or fenced mixed will not result in the athlete fulfilling the qualification requirement.\r\n** Events with 2 entrants will be cancelled and all 2 fencers in those events will auto-qualify.\r\n*** For events with 3 entrants, please show up to fence in this division even though all 3 fencers in those events will auto-qualify.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE OF DETERMINING THE QUALIFIERS:\r\n\r\n(If a fencer is already qualified, how would he\/she impact or change the qualifying event?)\r\n\r\nIn determining the number of qualifiers, the number of competitors is the total number of fencers who competed in the qualifying competition who are eligible to fence in the Championships. Once the qualifying competition is complete and the number of qualified athletes is determined, those who have already qualified to the Championships in that event (athletes determined to be automatic qualifiers) are skipped in determining those who have become qualifiers in that competition. For example, if there are 20 competitors \r\nin the qualifying competition, of whom four have already qualified for that particular championships event, those four are skipped in determining the five qualifiers from that competition. So, if the ones who are automatic qualifiers are 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, then the qualifiers from this competition are those who have placed 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\nELIGIBLE BIRTH YEARS:\r\n\r\nYOUTH 14:  Y14:  BORN 2001-2004\r\n\r\nEXCEPTION TO AGE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA (All other qualification criteria remains): \r\n\r\nYouth 14 \u0096 A fencer born after 2004 can fence in Youth 14 IF the fencer is on the National Youth 12 point standings at the time of the entry deadline for that tournament.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION AWARD:\r\n\r\nClassifications can be awarded at a qualifying competition. Classification changes and qualification will be based on the eligible fencers in the competition as submitted. Y14 events must attain a rating of C1 or greater for any classifications to be awarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE QUALIFYING EVENTS:\r\n\r\nQualification status after these competitions is not final until confirmed by the National Office.\r\n\r\nThe USA Fencing National Championship Entry Form is posted on the USA FENCING website under Events on the Nationals Tournament web site or competitors may register online at: https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/USFencing\/. \r\nEntries remain pending until results from the qualifying competition are received and processed.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Summer National Championship, visit the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/389098?referrer_id=669372\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFIER EVENTS SCHEDULED:\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent starting times may be adjusted in order to minimize the interval between close of registration and the start of the event: please MAKE SURE YOUR ASKFRED EMAIL ADDRESS IS VALID AND CHECK YOUR EMAIL DURING THE WEEK PRIOR to the tournament.\r\n\r\nY14 Men's Foil: 9:00AM\r\nY14 Women's Epee 9:30AM\r\nY14 Women's Foil: 12:30PM\r\nY14 Men's Epee: 1:00PM\r\nY14 Women's Saber: 2:00PM\r\nY14 Men's Saber: 3:00PM\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"The Fencing Center of San Jose","address":"1290 South First Street","city":"San Jose","state":"CA","zip":"95110","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.31803,"longitude":-121.87484,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":128073,"tournament_id":32428,"tournament":"CenCal 2016 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":11,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-07T09:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":128074,"tournament_id":32428,"tournament":"CenCal 2016 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":16,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-07T14:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":128075,"tournament_id":32428,"tournament":"CenCal 2016 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-07T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":128076,"tournament_id":32428,"tournament":"CenCal 2016 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":15,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-07T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":128077,"tournament_id":32428,"tournament":"CenCal 2016 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":25,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-07T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":128078,"tournament_id":32428,"tournament":"CenCal 2016 Youth 14 Summer National Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-07T15:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":32430,"name":"For the Love of Fencing","start_date":"2016-02-07","end_date":"","comments":"February is the Month of Love.

If there are less than 8 teams in an event, the format will be round-robin with all of the teams fencing each other. If there are 8 or more teams in a particular event, we will alter the format (by creating pools and a bracket) so the event will be limited to a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\nTeams may be mixed gender. Teams may also compete in more than one event. If you do not have a full team, feel free to register with a partial team. There will probably be extra fencers at the event who will be available to complete teams. The competition will be self-directed, but referees may be available to help if needed. Nick Nockel will be assisting with foil.\r\n\r\nThis event is co-hosted by University of Minnesota Fencing Club and St Thomas Fencing Club. The venue is McCarthy Gym at St Thomas - find it on the campus map: http:\/\/webapp.stthomas.edu\/campusmaps\/#nogo. We will be starting a little later due to venue restrictions, but will be able to stay in the gym until the event is completed, whenever that is.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The St Thomas legal department is asking that all participants sign a liability waiver. We will have some paper waivers available, but it would be very helpful if you could bring a completed copy to the tournament so we can save time on what will be a very packed day. For minors, please note that your parent or guardian also needs to sign.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

The objective is to provide Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers with individual club fencing qualification based on the series of tournaments throughout 2015-2016 fencing season. Each participant will be awarded with a number of points earned in a specific event at each competition. Each age group belongs to a specific Maximum Points bracket:\r\n\r\nAge Group Max. Points\r\nY10 50\r\nY12 100\r\nY14 200\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the earned Points at each event is as follows:\r\n\r\n((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x Maximum Points\r\n\r\n1st place receives the Maximum Points, while all consecutive places will receive the corresponding Points calculated through the above formula. All points will be rounded-up in case of the results with decimals. Below are several examples:\r\n\r\nY10 event of 10 fencers:\r\n1 = 50\r\n2 = 45\r\n3 = 40\r\n...\r\n10 = 5\r\n\r\nY12 event of 8 fencers:\r\n1 = 100\r\n2 = 88\r\n3 = 75\r\n...\r\n8 = 13\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of earned points for the Cup Series will be a sum of points earned in each competition, but will be limited to a specific age group and a weapon (if a fencer participates in several age group and weapon events).\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.
