Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2016-17 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2017, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 2000-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1998-2004 and for the cadet events 2001-2004.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"191 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.766135,"longitude":-73.9793606,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":144296,"tournament_id":36425,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #4 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Mixed Epee","short_name":"B+MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-02T09:45:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":34892,"name":"DCFC Champagne Challenge #5","start_date":"2017-04-02","end_date":"","comments":"Please join us for the fifth Champagne Challenge of the season.

Where there are 13 or more fencers in the final results, third place does not have to be fenced.\r\n\r\nWe will not fence an event if 3 or fewer fencers are signed up as all three will qualify. Fencers will be listed as DNF (did not fence). \r\nPer USFA guidelines, to qualify you must still pay registration and event fees and be present at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: Event format is one round of qualifying pools and 100% to direct eliminations.

Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using most current USFA membership data. Fencers\/Parents, please ensure YOUR email and not your coach's email is in the Askfred database. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door.

The eligibility guidelines are taken from the Athlete Handbook. RCCs and RJCs held after the Junior Olympic Championships will only accept entries from athletes for which the tournament serves as a qualification path: Therefore the birth years are as follows:\r\nDiv IA: Born 2003 or before (or on the Junior National Rolling Points List), with any rating \r\nEligibility is based on birth year, regardless of the specific day\/month\r\nCadet: Born in 2001 through 2004\r\nJunior: Born in 1998 through 2004\r\nFencers with Youth-14 National points are eligible to fence in Cadet events.\r\nFencers with Cadet National points are eligible to fence in Junior events.\r\n\r\nROC events function as qualifiers to the National Championships Division I-A, Division II and Veteran Categories, and may qualify fencers to other events, depending upon classification and status. The USFA Athlete Handbook contains detailed information on qualifying pathways and should be consulted as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\nROC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses; however, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USA Fencing National Championship events. An athlete can fence at any ROC and may earn points at any ROC. Regional points are awarded to 40% of the competitive field. In the event that a foreign fencer finishes within the qualifying group, the foreign fencer will be skipped. \r\n\r\nQualification Path to Div1A Nationals from the D1A ROCs\r\nPlaced in the top 8 at the previous season's Div1A National Championships, OR\r\nPlaced in the top 4 at the previous season's Div2 National Championships, OR\r\nBe on the current season's Div1A ROC Regional Point Standings, OR\r\nBe in the top 8 of the Div2 ROC Regional Point Standings\r\n\r\nQualification Path to Div1 July Challenge from the ROCs\r\nBe in the Top 16 of the Div1A ROC points\r\nBe in the Top 4 of the Div2 ROC points\r\n\r\nRegional Points \u0096 The ROCs award points to the top 40% of the competitive field at each ROC event.

Fees will NOT be refunded if an event is not fenced because everyone automatically qualifies.\r\n\r\nPre-payment on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Wednesday, April 5th. Registrations and payments made at the door will be DOUBLE the online price.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to register and pay online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=34642\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nAll events will be run as a single round of pools with 100% promoted to the direct elimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names are not required on jackets, lames, or knickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 2003 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 2002-2005\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nThe qualification rules for Division II\/III have changed slightly this year. \r\n\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14.  If you finished in the top 40% at a Div II ROC like Bladefest, you have earned Div II Regional Points and will be qualified for Div II\/III.  If you finished in the top 40% of a Div II NAC, then you are also qualified.\r\n\r\nY14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event.  Y14 fencers may also be qualified if they have sufficient Y14 regional points.\r\n\r\nFencer with Div II Regional Points are NOT skipped when calculating the qualifiers at this event.  This means that if you have regional points (and are therefore already qualified) but fence and finish in the top 25%, you will \"take up\" a qualification slot that could otherwise go to another fencer.  So you may not want to fence at this event so as to let other people qualify.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict (such as being out of town on business.)  \r\n\r\nContact chair@wwdfencing.org for more

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of four separate tournaments spread throughout the season, each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on the size of the tournament and where they finish, with the Grand Finale Tournament providing \"bonus\" points to competitors. \r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\nIn the inaugural season (2015-16) for The Music City Series, we awarded each of the Overall Series Champions (both in Foil and Epee) with the Grand Prize of a brand new Special Edition Epiphone electric guitar & guitar stand. This year's Grand Prizes haven't been announced, but we promise you won't be disappointed! \r\n\r\nMedals will be given to finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/13\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/31\/2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695342,"longitude":-86.6757895,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":138307,"tournament_id":34948,"tournament":"The Music City Series #4: The Grand Finale","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":37,"prereg_count":54,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-08T10:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":138309,"tournament_id":34948,"tournament":"The Music City Series #4: The Grand Finale","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":17,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-09T10:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":36486,"name":"MFG UCM Fencing Club Tournament","start_date":"2017-04-08","end_date":"2017-04-09","comments":"The Midwest Fencing Guild's April 2017 tournament.

Armorer will be on-site for repairs (for fee).\r\nName is NOT required on uniform.\r\nMedals awarded to top 8.\r\n100% advances to DE after pool results.\r\n\r\nPoints for RJCC\r\n=============\r\n-\tAll athletes whose USA Fencing's membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For more information on this Regional Points formula see the Regional Recognition Initiative Document available http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources\r\n-\tUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer's Regional Rank each season.\r\n-\tThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional points do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\n-\tThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet, he\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\n-\tThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events. Junior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and Junior Olympic\/National Championships.\r\n\r\nHost Hotel\r\n===========\r\nHoliday Inn Express & Suites Small Logo\r\nO'Fallon\/Shiloh\r\n3396 Green Mount Crossing Drive,\t\r\nShiloh, Illinois,\t\r\n62269, United States \r\n\r\nReservation link;\r\nhttps:\/\/www.ihg.com\/holidayinnexpress\/hotels\/us\/en\/reservation\/book?qRef=df&qRpn=1&qChld=0&qSrt=sBR&qSHp=1&qSmP=3&qGRM=0&qSlH=ofail&qRms=1&srb_u=1&qAdlt=1&qPSt=0&qRtP=6CBARC&qCiMy=032017&qHtlC=ofail&qCoD=09&qCiD=07&qGrpCd=FEN&qCoMy=032017&qRRSrt=rt&qRpp=20&qBrs=hi.ex.rs.ic.cp.in.sb.cw.cv.6c.vn.ul.ki&qWch=0&method=roomRate&icdv=99801505#roomratestitle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTournament Staff:\r\n\r\nTournament Director:\r\nCoach Hossam Hassan\r\nMcKendree University fencing head coach \r\n314-494-8689\r\n\r\nFOC:\r\nAbdelwahab Abdelaziz\r\n551-221-2211\r\n\r\nArmorer:\r\nChris Green\r\n\r\nBout Committee Chair:\r\nRasha Abdellatif \r\n314-494-8689\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Mckendree University","address":"701 College rd","city":"Lebanon","state":"IL","zip":"62254","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":38.6076721,"longitude":-89.8157017,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":36,"name":"St. Louis","abbrev":"STL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":135022,"tournament_id":34199,"tournament":"McKendree RJCC -

Two non profit entities that were important to Chuck were the Amarillo Competitive Fencing Association and The Bridge Children's Advocacy Center. You know about ACFA, but please visit http:\/\/www.bridgecac.org\/ to find out more info about The Bridge. \r\n\r\nChuck Slaughter started his fencing odyssey with his son, Jared, in Coach Howard's adult continuing education classes at Amarillo College. After developing a passion for fencing, Chuck started the youth fencing continuing education class in 2001. In his time as a coach and instructor at Amarillo College and the Amarillo Competitive Fencing Association he taught hundreds of ordinary adults and kids how to be better athletes and better members of society. Chuck expanded his fencing knowledge by earning certification with the United States Fencing Coaches Association and by learning one-on-one with an Olympic coach. The fencers Chuck taught ranged from weekend warriors, NCAA fencers, multiple national finalists, and a national champion. He spent countless hours coaching and teaching fencing three times a week for 15 years. He even traveled with his fencers to tournaments on his own dime all across the country and even to Europe. \r\nIn 2006, he was selected as the United States Fencing Association Volunteer Coach of the Year. In the same year he was also a finalist for the United States Olympic Committee Volunteer Coach of the Year. In 2009, he was awarded a United States Fencing Coach Medal when he coached Juleah Nusz to a national championship. He was even featured on an episode of Texas Country Reporter.\r\nChuck didn't coach for fame or money; he coached because he loved to teach and he loved his fencers. So many current and former AC fencers can trace life lessons back to what they learned from Chuck and the experiences they shared with him. There is no way any of us can replace Chuck or his passion. We each have our own Chuck stories. Early in the youth program, at an RYC in El Paso someone from Dallas asked Chuck what European style he taught. His answer: Amarillo style. His student went on to win the tournament.\r\n\r\nDATE\r\nApril 8, 2017\r\n\r\nVENUE\r\nAmarillo College\r\nCarter Fitness Center & AC Fencing Salle\r\nCorner of 24th Street & Washington\r\nAmarillo, TX 79109\r\n\r\nBOUT COMMITTEE AND FOC\r\nBout Committee Contact Info: bary.nusz@live.com (806) 553-0115\r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED\r\nFencing will commence for each event as soon as possible after close of registration.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60.

Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.

(I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply.

We encourage you to pre-register.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a qualifier, it is open ONLY to members of the Metropolitan Division.  If USA Fencing lists you under New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester, Alaska, or any other division you won't be able to fence in this event.\r\n \r\nYou must belong to USA Fencing with proof of membership in order to compete.  Join or renew at http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership.  If you need to join USA Fencing on-site, you will need a separate check or credit card # for their form. \r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y14 points will be allowed to fence Cadets.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Metropolitan Division sanctioned event. Ratings will be awarded where earned.\r\n\r\nPlease bring a check or cash if you don't prepay using AskFred; no credit cards accepted at the door for entry fees.\r\n\r\nNo refunds! If you need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail (info@brooklynfencing.com) by midnight on Friday, 4\/7, to receive a credit for a future event.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetition Format\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination; for 12 or fewer fencers, third place qualifying spot will be fenced off.\r\n\r\nNEW LOCATION 600 Degraw Street (between 3rd & 4th Ave) - Closest train is the R at Union Street, three blocks away.

However, any RYC held before the March NAC but AFTER the deadline for entry will NOT be considered for qualification to this tournament.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) The Y10 and Y12 events at SN this season will be National Championships. The Y10 path remains participation in an RYC = qualification.  For Y12, the RYC path is the top 50% of the fencers on their Regions point standings will qualify.  Foreign Fencers will be skipped and the next eligible fencer will qualify as these events are now National Championships. The SYC\/NAC NRPS points path remains the same.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3) The winner of a Y14 RYC will NO longer earn automatic qualification to SNs.  Rather, at the end of the season, the top 25% on each region's list will qualify.  The SYC\/NAC NRPS path remains the same and the division qualifiers for Y14 are still in place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are fewer than 5 fencers in any gender for that age\/weapon.\r\n\r\nPreregistration Closing Date \/$ 30\/is 4\/5\/2017\r\nEvent fee $ 25 will be collected at the door\/cash or check only\/.\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble registration fee\/$ 60\/,and events fees \/$ 50\/ will be collected at the door\/ cash or check payments only\/.\r\n\r\n2016-2017 Age Classification USFA restriction rules:\r\n\r\n YOUTH 14..........YOUTH 12.........YOUTH 10\r\n 2002-2005.........2004-2007........2006-2009\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSunday , April 9\r\n\r\n9:30 am Y 10 epee\r\n9 am Y 14 epee\r\n2 pm Y 12 epee\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note:  The above times are the close of registration.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an \u0093incomplete\u0094 registrant on FRED\u0092s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nFencers competing in Div 2\/3 events must follow the rating restrictions set forth by the USFA. Only fencers with a rating of C or lower are eligible to fence at these qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform.\r\n\r\n800N SABRE GLOVES ARE REQUIRED THIS SEASON. As of October 1st, 2015, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the 800N Sabre Glove. Gloves will be checked at the armory prior to competition. For more information, please see the following: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/537287?referrer_id=669372-usa-fencing-news \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778. They can be contacted at 631-821-1131 for directions or assistance. A map can be found at http:\/\/bit.ly\/mfcmap Mission is in the same shopping center as Kohl\u0092s, Michael\u0092s, and PETCO.

Ample parking can be found around the back of the shopping center, near the main entrance to Mission.\r\n\r\nMission does have a store with limited stock of fencing equipment.

Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

She began competing at the international level in the late 1970\u0092s. A pupil of the great Maestro Livio Di Rosa, she first participated in the World Championships in 1977, at the age of 13. She won the Italian youth title the following year, and the prestigious New York Martini Trophy.\r\n\r\nAt 16 Dorina competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, placing 4th in individual and 5th in team. In 1981 she won the World Cup, followed a year later by her first of several European and World Championships. She continued her Olympic careers in Los Angeles (Bronze), Seoul Korea (Silver) and 1992 Barcelona (Gold). After the bronze in the World Cup team of 1993, Dorina left competition, only to return in 1998 to win the Italian title.\r\n\r\nDorina began to devote herself to competitive cycling in 2000, taking many marathon victories and winning a master Italian title in the world category.
