The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.  These ranking systems mirror that of the National Governing Body, USA Fencing, and the International Governing Body, Federation International de\u0092 Escrime (FIE).  Each tournament in the JOC will award fencers in the final four with medals.  Each tournament in the ICC will award the final eight fencers with medals.

There will be foil events for all age groups, plus Y12 Epee.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #4\r\nDate(s): 06\/04\/2016\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, June 4th, 2016\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y12 Epee\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $15 including tax per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2015-2016 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2003-2006\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2001-2004\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=31374\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/03\/2016\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

We always strive to begin an event within 30 minutes of close.\r\n\r\nFencers in multiple events WILL NOT BE GIVEN BREAK TIME between pool or DE bouts in different events.  This severely delays the tournament, and the USFA only requires a 10 minute break between DE bouts in the same event.\r\n\r\nAll events are sanctioned USFA events.  Membership is required.  Please join the USFA, if needed, prior to the tournament.\r\n\r\nDirect Eliminations will be fenced for all events. Senior events with more than 6 fencers of each gender will be separated. \r\n\r\nZERO TOLERANCE FOR POOR CONDUCT. This applies to spectators, fencers and coaches.

Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.\r\n\r\nCFC is a member of the CT Division of the USFA \r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nCFC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at:http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 3 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

There will be no exceptions to this policy. Any refunds will be net of surcharges from Ask Fred.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS:\r\n\r\nUSFA uniform requirements apply. Names are NOT required on your uniform. Fencers must wear the required clothing regulation fencing jacket and pants, underarm protector (plastron), knee socks and a fencing glove that covers half the forearm. The electric foil bib is required. Women must wear breast protectors. In epee and foil, a full jacket is required (i.e., a jacket with croissard \/ groin strap). \r\n\r\nWarm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing uniforms or gloves must not have any rips, tears, holes, etc. USA Fencing allows uniforms of a single pastel color or designs on the rear (unarmed) arm and leg. As the purpose of uniform color or design is for audience interest, such designs should be in good taste. For safety and insurance purposes, fencers must wear full fencing attire while participating in drills, lessons or warm-up.\r\n\r\nBlade Length: Y8 & Y10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches (\u00930 & 2's\u0094). Parents and fencers are advised that blades marked as \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however some blades labeled as #2 have exceeded 32.5 inches, these blades will not be permitted.\r\n \r\nEQUIPMENT CHECK \r\n\r\nParents and fencers should plan accordingly and arrive at least 1 hour prior to the close of check in, there may be significant lines for equipment check.   Please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nFencers must present to the armorer for testing of mask, lame jacket, gloves (saber) and body cords. Items passing inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\nAll events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary inspection will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE to ensure the presence of the following equipment: underarm plastron, weapons, body cords and all appropriate weapons check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met. \r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other required equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules. \r\n\r\nFencers will only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the tournament. \r\n\r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords. Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition. \r\n\r\nNote that Blue Gauntlet Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\n\r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.\r\n \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\n\r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\nY10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 touches or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. \r\n\r\n(The rules for handling ties in score at the end of regulation, awarding of cards and non-combativity will apply as currently written.)\r\n\r\nMEDALS: \r\n\r\nIn the Y8 events, medals will be given to the Top 8 finishers.
