Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY14 Mixed Saber\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519  Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48091,"tournament_id":11163,"tournament":"Youth 14\/12 Foil","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-03-28T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":48641,"tournament_id":11163,"tournament":"Youth 14\/12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":20,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-03-28T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11164,"name":"Youth 12 Foil","start_date":"2010-03-28","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-03-01","prereg_close":"2010-03-25","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 03\/01\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/25\/2010.\r\nThis event is Sunday, March 28th only.

Be early, peeps!\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1) Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older (1996 or earlier birthdate) are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/01\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48643,"tournament_id":11285,"tournament":"Open Sabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-03T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9765,"name":"Midwest Youth Quarterly at Olympia","start_date":"2010-04-03","end_date":"","comments":"Fence like an Olympian at the Midwest Youth Quarterly for Youth Foil,Sabre and Epee.  $25 for the first event and $10 for the second.

Proof of USFA membership is required. If you are auto-qualified for the SN, you are still encouraged to fence!

Full USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove.  Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or sabre, as appropriate), and two working body cords.  \r\n \r\nEquipment checks are conducted at qualifying events held in the Oregon Division.  Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lame's are in good working order prior to the event.  \r\n \r\nFees: Registration fees are $15 per fencer, plus $10 per event (i.e., a total of $25 for one event) for those that preregister on AskFred. Preregistration will be closed TWO days before the event (i.e., WEDNESDAY nights).  Late registration fees (at the door) will increase to $35, plus $10 per event.  Also, please remember that we only accept cash or checks at Division events. CREDIT CARDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT TEAM INFO:\r\nTeams must preregister in advance (by April 7) to determine if a fence-off is needed (we can qualify up to four clubs without a fence-off).  We will notify you by email on April 8, 2010 if we need your team to show up and fence.

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they qualified at Sectionals or the Battle in Seattle.)\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  All fencers must be US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced (and event fees will be refunded) since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\nIf you have already qualified for Div II\/III (by qualifying for Div I-A at the Battle in Seattle or at Sectionals), you can still attend this event (if you're rated C or under.)  You won't \"take up\" a qualification since you are already qualified - you'll help the numbers but will be skipped when awarding qualifications.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule -----\r\nSaturday 4\/10\/10\r\n10:00 am - Men's Foil & Women's Epee\r\n1:00 pm - Women's Saber\r\n\r\nSunday 4\/11\/10\r\n10:00 am - Men's Epee & Women's Foil\r\n1:00 pm - Men's Saber\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe entry fee is a flat $20 per event.  \r\n\r\nRegistration AND payment on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm PDT on Wednesday April 7th.  If you do not register and pay by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.   \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=11177\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nALL events will be run as two rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.  The combined results from the two pool rounds will be used to seed the DE tableau.  Depending on how many fencers attend, we may do a cut after the second round of pools. \r\n\r\nThis two-rounds-of-pools format has proven to be popular with the fencers since it gives everyone a lot of fencing.  It also tends to \"smooth out\" the seeding - if you fence poorly in the first round of pools, you can redeem yourself by fencing well in the second round.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nAll fencers must have been born in 1996 or earlier to fence in this event.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict (such as being out of town on business.)  \r\n\r\nContact chair@wwdfencing.org for more info on petitions.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"760 Harrison Street","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","zip":"98109","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6222207,"longitude":-122.3416157,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48123,"tournament_id":11177,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - Div II\/III Events","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-10T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":48124,"tournament_id":11177,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - Div II\/III Events","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-11T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":48126,"tournament_id":11177,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - Div II\/III Events","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":19,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-11T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":48127,"tournament_id":11177,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - Div II\/III Events","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-10T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":48128,"tournament_id":11177,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier - Div II\/III Events","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-11T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":10929,"name":"Prise de Fer Girls' SYC with Y-14 Team Events","start_date":"2010-04-10","end_date":"2010-04-11","comments":"PLEASE NOTE VENUE CHANGE: NEW VENUE - PRISE DE FER FENCING CLUB\r\n\r\nRegular registration has closed \r\n\r\nLate registration will be open from 3\/10 - 4\/07\/2010.

Based on the times for each event, and the crossovers which will occur, some guidelines will be implemented and enforced.\r\n \r\nIn order to keep the pace of the tournament moving, and to avoid inconvieniencing all fencers by creating delays, the following format will be used:\r\n \r\nIf your 2nd (or 3rd) event begins prior to your completion of the previous, Directors will be instructed to skip your bouts for as long as possible.  A bout committee member will then inform you when your presence will be required at the 2nd\/3rd event.  You will be given at least a 2-4 bout cushion (depending on weapon) in order to gather the proper equipment\/apparel.  Your current event will continue to fence until you are required again.  When your bout comes up, if you are called and fail to show, a yellow card will be given, a second call will be made after 1 minute, failure to show, a red card will be issued, after a final one minute, failure to show will result in your removal from that event.  There will be only 1 exception, you are within a couple of minutes of fencing a DE, DEs will take priority.\r\n\r\nThis is not set in stone. Each circumstance will be reviewed and considerations MAY be made.  The decision of the Bout Committee will be final.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 03\/01\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/09\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Victor Valley High School","address":"16500 Mojave Dr.","city":"Victorville","state":"CA","zip":"92395","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":8,"name":"San Bernardino","abbrev":"SNBER","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":43009,"tournament_id":9915,"tournament":"Haake & Slasche","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-10T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":47951,"tournament_id":9915,"tournament":"Haake & Slasche","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":36,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-10T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":47952,"tournament_id":9915,"tournament":"Haake & Slasche","full_name":"Women's Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-10T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":47953,"tournament_id":9915,"tournament":"Haake & Slasche","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":24,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-10T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":47954,"tournament_id":9915,"tournament":"Haake & Slasche","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-10T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11209,"name":"2010 San Diego Fencing Center Challenge RYC","start_date":"2010-04-10","end_date":"2010-04-11","comments":"2010 RYC hosted at San Diego Fencing Center in Escondido California.\r\n","prereg_open":"2010-03-05","prereg_close":"2010-04-08","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":30,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"2010 San Diego RYC event.
