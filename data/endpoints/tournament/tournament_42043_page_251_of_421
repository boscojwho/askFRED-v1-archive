If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

As a youth of 18, while vacationing with his parents, he was challenged to a duel by an Italian nobleman who mistakenly assumed he had designs on a young lady.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.

Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event.

We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2003-2006\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2001-2004\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=31371\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/09\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

The objective is to provide Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers with individual club\r\nfencing qualification based on the series of tournaments throughout 2015-2016 fencing season. Each participant will be awarded with a number of points earned in a specific event at each competition. Each age group belongs to a specific Maximum Points bracket:\r\n\r\nAge Group Max. Points\r\nY10 50\r\nY12 100\r\nY14 200\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the earned Points at each event is as follows:\r\n\r\n((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x Maximum Points\r\n\r\n1st place receives the Maximum Points, while all consecutive places will receive the corresponding Points calculated through the above formula. All points will be rounded-up in case of the results with decimals. Below are several examples:\r\n\r\nY10 event of 10 fencers:\r\n1 = 50\r\n2 = 45\r\n3 = 40\r\n...\r\n10 = 5\r\n\r\nY12 event of 8 fencers:\r\n1 = 100\r\n2 = 88\r\n3 = 75\r\n...\r\n8 = 13\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of earned points for the Cup Series will be a sum of points earned in each competition, but will be limited to a specific age group and a weapon (if a fencer participates in several age group and weapon events).\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please register for an additional event in a different category that you ARE age eligible to participate in, and then email the organizers with the name of the athlete, and the events that need to be switched around. Please verify your eligibility via NRPS BEFORE doing this! No refunds will be given for ineligible fencers who mistakenly enter.\r\n\r\nWAIVER OF LIABILITY:\r\nA completed waiver form signed by a parent or legal guardian is required.

Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\n\r\nSEEDING: Seeding for Youth Events shall be based on the following order:\r\n1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nSeeding for Regional Cadet Events will be posted when the Tournament Committee designates how these events will be seeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT:\r\nAll RYC events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per RYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\nNo fence off for 3rd place.\r\nFor Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nFor Y12, Y14, Cadet, Junior events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nAll events serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments; therefore, no events may be combined regardless of number of entrants.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS:\r\nPlease see the Athlete Handbook for the latest details on points for Regional Youth Circuit events, as well as qualifications to National Events.\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday or Sunday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday or Monday of this tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents

That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event.

RJCC events function as qualifiers to the Junior Olympic Fencing Championships.    The USFA Athlete Handbook contains detailed information on qualifying pathways and should be consulted as the appropriate reference document.    RJCC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses; however, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in Junior Olympic Fencing Championship events. \r\n\r\nThe RJCC point standings are calculated according to the following guidelines: In each RJCC category (Junior and Cadet)the size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of region. Regional RJCC Points are only earned in the fencers own region (for this event, regional points will be awarded to each competitor residing in Region 3 - your Region is assigned based on Division affiliation).  RJCC uses this formula:  ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points).  The winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.  Best 2 results from RJCCs within the athlete\u0092s region count toward Regional point totals on a rolling point basis.

Drop off your fencer and a parent at the building entrance with their equipment so they can go up to the fourth floor and check in. \r\n 2. Drive to the corner of Grove St and 18th St. Turn left and proceed about 200 yards until you see a yellow post at an open entrance on the left. You can turn in and park as long as you stay well right. Do not block any truck bays or construction areas. Do not go left into The Cake Boss\u0092s parking area. Walk back to Grove Street along 18th St.\r\n\r\n===========================================HOTELS===========================================\r\nNearby Jersey City Hotels:\r\nThe Doubletree Hotel; rates start appx. $150\r\n455 Washington Boulevard \r\nJersey City, NJ 07310\r\nTel: 1-201-499-2400 \r\nhttp:\/\/doubletree1.hilton.com\/en_US\/dt\/hotel\/EWRWTDT-Doubletree-Hotel-Jersey-City-New-Jersey\/index.do\r\n\r\nHyatt Regency; rates start at appx. $200\r\n2 Exchange Place\r\n201-469-1234\r\nhttp:\/\/www.jerseycity.hyatt.com\/hyatt\/hotels\/index.jsp\r\n\r\nWestin Jersey City Newport; rates start at appx. $225\r\n479 Washington Blvd\r\n201-626-2900\r\nhttp:\/\/www.starwoodhotels.com\/westin\/property\/overview\/index.html?propertyID=3049 \r\n\r\n================================ABOUT COBRA FENCING CLUB=================================\r\nLocated at: 629 Grove Street; Jersey City, NJ (http:\/\/www.cobrafencing.com)\r\n\r\nSteve Kaplan - Club owner\/Coach \r\n\u0095 (U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Fencing Master)\r\n\u0095 1976 U.S. Olympic Team Member \u0096 Sabre.\r\n\u0095 1975 Pan American Games Silver Medalist.\r\n\u0095 4 time U.S. National Team Champion.\r\n\u0095 1971 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All American \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Varsity Head Fencing Coach NYU 1980-1986.\r\n\u0095 Elected to NYU Athletic Hall of Fame 1996.\r\n\u0095 Founded Cobra Fencing Club in 2002.\r\n\r\nDemetrios \u0093Mitro\u0094 Valsamis \u0096 Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 Under-19 U.S. Foil Champion 1979, 1980.\r\n\u0095 Cadet Sabre Champion 1976, 1977.\r\n\u0095 1983 NCAA Foil Champion \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Foil Coach at Cobra since 2003.\r\n\r\nRaskyrie (Ras) Davidson - Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 2005, 2006, 2007 United States Junior World Team Member\r\n\u0095 2006 World Cadet Saber Bronze Medalist\r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Cadet Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Junior Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2004 United States National Cadet Saber Champion\r\n\r\nCobra Fencing Club is a member of the NJ Division of USA Fencing (http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org). \r\n","venue":{"name":"Cobra Fencing Club","address":"629 Grove Street","city":"Jersey City","state":"NJ","zip":"07310","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7335248,"longitude":-74.0413617,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":118372,"tournament_id":30130,"tournament":"NO-Cobra Challenge RJCC (Region 3)","full_name":"Div1A Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv1ASrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div1A","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-17T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"},{"id":118373,"tournament_id":30130,"tournament":"NO-Cobra Challenge RJCC (Region 3)","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-18T08:15:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"},{"id":118374,"tournament_id":30130,"tournament":"NO-Cobra Challenge RJCC (Region 3)","full_name":"Div1A Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"Dv1ASrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div1A","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-10-18T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"60.00"}]}]}
