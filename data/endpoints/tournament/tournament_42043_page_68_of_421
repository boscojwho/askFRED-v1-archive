Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes

With regard to safety, each fencer must wear full fencing clothing, including a plastron (under-arm protector), knickers, and long socks. Masks will be punch-tested for safety at the event. \r\n* We understand that electric equipment can be a difficult issue for youth fencers and their parents, but in order to keep the meet running smoothly, each fencer should have his\/her own lame (foil\/saber), electric mask (saber), and primary body cord and weapon. USFA rules require each fencer to have a second body cord and a second weapon by the strip; these may be shared amongst teammates\/friends, however each fencer should know where his or her secondary equipment is. \r\n* Blade length for Y10 fencers must be 30\" or 32\" inches long","venue":{"name":"Minnesota Sword Club","address":"4744 Chicago Ave So","city":"Minneapolis","state":"MN","zip":"55418","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":44.9165569,"longitude":-93.2627998,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":35,"name":"Minnesota","abbrev":"MN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":32518,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":1,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32519,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32520,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32521,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32522,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32523,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32524,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32525,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":32526,"tournament_id":7310,"tournament":"Aramis Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-29T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":8091,"name":"BCAF Foil Open","start_date":"2009-03-29","end_date":"","comments":"This is a Philadelphia Division mixed, senior, open event.

It was once one of the largest fencing events in the Southeastern U.S. (comparable to the Crescent City Open), drawing competitors from Florida, as well as international fencers from Latin America and Europe. Its name comes from, obviously, the color of the UF mascot, but also the event's proximity to St. Patrick's Day. The last consecutive annual tournament was held in 1999. The event was revived on its 40th Anniversary in 2006. 2009 will mark the 43rd Anniversary of the Green Gator Classic.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Fees<\/b>\r\n<i>Pre-registration<\/i>\r\n$25 First event; $20 Additional events\r\n\r\n<i>Door<\/i>\r\n$35 First event; $20 Additional events\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Location, Directions, and Parking<\/b>\r\nThe tournament will take place in the Florida Gym, which is located on Stadium Road next to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium (\"The Swamp\").\r\n\r\nFrom I-75, take exit 387, Newberry Road.

This is a qualifying event for Division 2, Division 3, Jr. Team & Sr. Team events to summer nationals. All fencers must be born 1995 or earlier, be current USFA members and have all required gear. If you sign up for membership online please, bring the confirmation page with you to the tournament. \r\n\r\nSome details about the tournament:\r\nDivision 2 events are for fencers C & under. The top 25% (minimum of 4 fencers) will qualify\r\nDivision 3 events are for fencers D & under. The top 25% (minimum of 4 fencers) will qualify\r\nBecause we hold these events together then the top 25% of the fencers in the total event will qualify for Division 2. The top 25% of the remainder will qualify for Division 3 only. Those fencers who qualify for Division 2 will automatically qualify for Division 3 as well.\r\n\r\nTeam events require a minimum of 3 fencers per team fielded. Fencers must all be from the same club for that club to fence. A fielded team that qualifies to nationals does not have to consist of the team that was present at the qualifier. The qualifier is solely for qualifying teams to the nationals. The fees to field a team at the qualifier is $15\/team. All fencers must meet minimum age requirements and be USFA members. \r\n\r\nSince often times there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough fencers from one club to field a team, if there are less than 2 teams registered on the day of the event, a mixed team match will be fenced for fun and those teams registered will automatically qualify.\r\n\r\nTimes listed are CLOSE OF CHECK IN.
