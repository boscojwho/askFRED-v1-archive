I'll put a real start time up by Nov 24, fencing will start 30 minutes after registration closes.\r\n\r\nDON'T try to sign up as a team for Random Draw Team.  It's not that sort of team event.  See the 'Random Draw' part?  We'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from Men's, Women's and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  It's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nThe Random Draw Team event will show that it is an E1 or a D1 event, or perhaps even a C2 or, God forbid, a C3, but that of course will not hold, since it's a team event.  Sorry.  You'll have to get your rating in the Men's or Women's.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it\u0092s about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.  After you cross the railroad tracks look for the college on the left.  We\u0092ll have some signs up to guide you to the gym.  Depending on where in Houston you\u0092re coming from it\u0092s about an hour drive.  \r\n\r\nMap:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/tinyurl.com\/bcfal\r\n\r\nIf you get lost call me on my cell - 979 848 7433\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/24\/2005.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/25\/2005.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brazosport College, Lake Jackson TX","address":"","city":"Lake Jackson","state":"TX","zip":"77566","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":29.0620369,"longitude":-95.4882679,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":6126,"tournament_id":1433,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge D and under Epee","full_name":"Div3 Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv3ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":21,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2005-11-26T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":6127,"tournament_id":1433,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge D and under Epee","full_name":"Div3 Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv3WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2005-11-26T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":6646,"tournament_id":1433,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge D and under Epee","full_name":"Mixed  Random Draw Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":" Random Draw","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":1437,"name":"Fleur de Lys Turkey Tourney 2005","start_date":"2005-11-26","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2005-10-24","prereg_close":"2005-11-25","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"FRED Announces the Fleur de Lys Turkey Tourney\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nThe Fleur de Lys Turkey Tourney\r\nDate: Saturday, November 26, 2005\r\n\r\nLocation: Magnolia Community Center, \r\n2550 34th Avenue West, Seattle\r\n\r\nWeapons: Mixed Foil and Mixed Saber\r\n\r\nTime: Mixed Foil--check in at 10:00 a.m., fencing begins at 10:30 a.m.\r\n\r\nMixed Saber--check in at 1:00 p.m, fencing begins at 1:30 p.m.\r\n\r\nEntry Fee: $10.00 per weapon\r\n\r\nFormat will depend on the number of competitors.

If you are interested in competing in this tournament, you must meet all age and citizenship qualification requirements, as well as qualify through your Division if you are not an automatic qualifier.  This means that if more than 3 fencers from the Alabama Division are interested in competing in the same event (e.g., Junior Women\u0092s Sabre) at Junior Olympics, then a qualifying competition must be held at the Division level.\r\n\r\nThe top 25% of the competitors at the qualifying tournament (no fewer than 3) will be eligible to compete in the Junior Olympics competition.  If it is necessary to hold a qualifying event for the Alabama Division, it will be held on Sunday, December 4, 2005.  The cost will be $25.00 to register for the first event and $10.00 to register for each additional event.  The tournament will be held at the Birmingham Fencing Club, 1425 Montgomery Hwy., Ste. 25, Birmingham, Alabama 35216.  Directions to the Birmingham Fencing Club can be found on the club website at http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org.\r\n\r\nTo fence in the Cadet events, a fencer must have been born in 1989-1992, or be on the Y14 National Point Standings for that weapon. \r\n\r\nTo fence in the Junior events, a fencer must have been born in 1986-1992, or be on the Cadet National Point Standings for that weapon.\r\n\r\nComplete details concerning the qualification procedure and requirements are set forth in the 2005-2006 Athlete Handbook, the full text of which is available on the USFA website at www.usfencing.org.\r\n\r\nYou must pre-register by November 25, 2005 in order to compete in this competition.  Your entry form and payment must be received by the Alabama Division Secretary no later than November 25, 2005.  You may pre-register on AskFred.net.
