This year, there will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2007-2008 age requirements: \r\nYouth-8:  born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12: born in 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14: born in 1993-1996\r\n\r\n(Fencers who are on the USFA national point standings in one age bracket are also eligible to compete in the next higher age bracket.)\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.  The first series will end at Youth Progressive #4 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4; the second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8.  Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil, Youth-12 Foil, Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.  \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1.  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event.  If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2.  Events are mixed (boys and girls).  Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender.  (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3.  Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments.  Point standings will be posted at www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4.  The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series.

Receipts from clubs or other tournaments are not acceptable as these membership forms may not have been submitted. Membership forms will be available at the venue. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (bring separate checks for the tournament and membership).\r\n\r\nAll participants must have a WAIVER OF LIABILITY and CONSENT FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT FORM properly signed by a parent or guardian.\r\n\r\nParticipants are required to fence in proper fencing attire; current USFA rules will apply.

This is a charity event and as such all participants will receive proper paperwork verifying their charitable donation.  Come out, fence, support Barbara Lynch and the NOCC, and have fun at what will be a great event. \r\n\r\nBarbara Lynch is a well known figure in the Local and National fencing arenas.  She has given tirelessly to the sport and is well known as an advocate for youth fencers. Barbara was diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year and underwent treatment which led to remission, but recently found out that more treatments are necessary.  It is time to honor and thank her for her work on behalf of young fencers.\r\n\r\nThis RYC fulfills the qualifying path for Y10\/12 fencers wishing to compete at Summer Nationals or Y10\/12 NAC. Attending a RYC will qualify that individual in the respective event and age category fenced. \r\n\r\nRatings can be awarded, however youth events do not use the E1 or D1 classifications; these events are NR until they reach C1 level or higher.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----Fencers will receive a goodie bag including commemorative patch and t-shirt.  \r\n----Silent Auction \r\n----Prizes for top finishers\r\n\r\nMoney is also being raised to purchase Barbara her own Lifetime USFA Membership. Donate at www.escrimeinternational.com\/barbara\/barbara.html.  You can also make donations at the event. \r\n\r\n*NJFA Youth Cup points will also be awarded toward 2007-08 NJFA Youth Cup Series prizes. All youth events held at NJFA from September 2007 through June 2008 are eligible for Youth Cup series prizes.  Points will be awarded for first 5 places in each event (there is no fence-off for third at this RYC so third place points will be awarded to both fencers).  Cup points are cumulative and prizes will be awarded to top 3 point finishers in each event at the last tournament of the series (more info at njfencingalliance.com)\r\n\r\n<b>FEES<\/b>\r\nRegular fee entry deadline Thursday, December 20, 2007 - $25 registration fee\/$20 per event.\r\nAfter December 20 and walk-in fee - $25 registration fee\/$35 per event \r\n\r\nPayment can be made through FRED or at the door (preferred).
