Our goal is to create a positive tournament experience and setting for every fencer, while providing a level of professionalism expected of an elite fencing center.\r\n\r\nThe SFSFL incorporates two Circuits within its infrastructure, The Junior & Open Circuit (JOC) and The Individual Challenge Circuit (ICC).  The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.  These ranking systems mirror that of the National Governing Body, USA Fencing, and the International Governing Body, Federation International de\u0092 Escrime (FIE).  Each tournament in the JOC will award fencers in the final four with medals.  Each tournament in the ICC will award the final eight fencers with medals.  These circuits also provide seasonal awards for Overall Ranking Champions and Individual Champions, as well as MVP, Coaches Awards, etc.\r\n\r\nEVENTS INCLUDE:\r\nOpen Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nJunior Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nDivision-3 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-12 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-10 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-8 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE: (all times = close of registration)\r\nSaturday JANUARY 23:\r\n2pm \u0096 Division-3 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-8 Mixed Sabre\r\nSunday JANUARY 24:\r\n10am \u0096 Open Mixed Sabre\r\n10am \u0096 Youth-12 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Junior Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-10 Mixed Sabre\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\nSabre Outreach Network\r\nDuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center\r\n3017 NW 60th St\r\nFort Lauderdale, FL  33308\r\n\r\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\r\n954-990-0090\r\nMitchB5659@comcast.net\r\nDan.Berliner@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/29\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/24\/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"DuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center","address":"3017 NW 60th St","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state":"FL","zip":"33309","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":26.2007656,"longitude":-80.1860775,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":120290,"tournament_id":30565,"tournament":"Winter Beaches Classic - SFSFL #5","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-01-23T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120291,"tournament_id":30565,"tournament":"Winter Beaches Classic - SFSFL #5","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y8MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-01-23T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120292,"tournament_id":30565,"tournament":"Winter Beaches Classic - SFSFL #5","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-01-24T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120293,"tournament_id":30565,"tournament":"Winter Beaches Classic - SFSFL #5","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-01-24T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120294,"tournament_id":30565,"tournament":"Winter Beaches Classic - SFSFL #5","full_name":"Junior Mixed Saber","short_name":"JrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":0,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-01-24T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120295,"tournament_id":30565,"tournament":"Winter Beaches Classic - SFSFL #5","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-01-24T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":31081,"name":"SAS Saber #4: Y10, Y12, Y14, Open","start_date":"2016-01-23","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2015-08-27","prereg_close":"2016-01-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"<b>SAS SABER #4: Y10, Y12, Y14, Open<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE<\/b>\r\n11:30am -- Y10 Mixed Saber\r\n11:30am -- Y14 Mixed Saber\r\n12:30pm -- Y12 Mixed Saber\r\n1:30pm -- Senior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\n<b>ENTRY<\/b>\r\nThis event is sanctioned by the Western Washington Division and ratings can be awarded.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USFA competitive membership is required.

Fencers must show proof they are COMPETITIVE members of the USFA. \r\n\r\nFencers must check-in with their membership card or a letter of good standing. Athletes without proof of membership must fill out all appropriate forms to pay for membership. Payment will be returned if membership can be verified.\r\nUSA Fencing is working towards an age verification process. An athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via email, mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the database. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and temporary membership cards.\r\nThis season, parents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to: information@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nYou will not be allowed to fence, no matter what events you participated in last season, without proof of USFA competitive membership and age verification.\r\n\r\nBirth Year Eligibility 2015-2016 season:Y10 2005-2008\r\nY12 2003-2006 (or on Y10 NRPS list)\r\nY14 2001-2004 (or on Y12 NRPS list)\r\nCadet (U17) 1999-2002 (or on Y14 NRPS list)\r\nSpecial Notes about Birth Year vs National Points List to determine Eligibility: The North Texas Roundup SYC and Cadets uses birth year eligibility for the 2014-2015 season. Age eligibility for events is determined by BIRTH YEAR, not age at time of participation.\r\nIf you are not eligible by BIRTH YEAR, but have NATIONAL POINTS for the age group younger than the event you want to enter, you are eligible to fence in that age group. For example, if you are born in 2002, you may only enter CADET if you are on the Youth 14 National Points List for the same weapon.\r\n\r\nAt this time, askfred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible. If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please register for an additional event in a different category that you ARE age eligible to participate in, and then email the organizers with the name of the athlete, and the events that need to be switched around. Please verify your eligibility via NRPS BEFORE doing this! No refunds will be given for ineligible fencers who mistakenly enter. Please help us to process all of the registrations efficiently by paying for the different event before emailing the organizers. \r\n\r\nAwards will be given to the top eight finishers in each event\r\n\r\nEvents by Close Registration Times\r\nRegistration for ALL events opens 1 hour prior to close\r\nThe armoury will be open for equipment inspection starting at 6pm at the Convention Center on Friday, September 4th.

Registrations not paid by a registration deadline will be deleted from the askfred fencer list for this tournament. Fencers who register after the close of regular registration on August 14 are not guaranteed to have their names included in the t-shirt list.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT GUIDELINESStandard fencing uniforms; cannot have any rips, tears, or holes. Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing glove must cover half of the forearm. Names on uniforms are not required per SYC guidelines.\r\nStandard fencing plastron; required with every uniform; women must wear chest protector.\r\nMask: 12K punch test. Sewn-in or channel (Leon Paul X-change style) bib. Conductive Bib in foil is required. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\nThe maximum blade length permitted for Y10  competitions is 32.5 inches. This requirement shall be strictly enforced. Y12, Y14 and Cadet competitions, standard blade length of 30-35\u0094 permitted.\r\nAny attachment to a weapon's handle must fix the hand in one position such that the top of the thumb is no more than 2 cm from the inner surface of the guard.\r\nEpee wiring must meet the current standards in effect as of August 1, 2013. For more information, please see http:\/\/www.fencingofficials.org\/blog\/2013\/05\/wiring-epees\/\r\n\r\nSEEDING:Seeding for Youth Events shall be based on the following order:1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nSeeding for Regional Cadet Events will be posted when the Tournament Committee designates how these events will be seeded.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nAll events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations.  Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per SYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau.  Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\nNo fence off for 3rd place.\r\nFor Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nFor Y12, Y14 and Cadet events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nAll events serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments, therefore, no events may be combined regardless of number of entrants.<\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS:\r\nPlease see the Athlete Handbook for the latest details on points for Super Youth and Regional Cadet Circuit events, as well as qualifications to National Events\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday or Sunday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday or Monday of this tournament.\r\n\r\nBout Committee\r\nBrenda Waddoups - Bout Committee Chair\r\n\r\nArmourer\r\nOvy Waddoups - Head Armorer\r\n\r\nReferee Cadre\r\nDavid Sierra - Referee Coordinator coach@cuttingedgefencing.com\r\nMark Stasinos - Head Referee\r\nFernando Delgado\r\nAhmed Fayez\r\nZach Brown\r\nNelly Evanyk\r\nAdam Brewer\r\nSusan Borgos\r\nAbdelwahab Abdelaziz\r\nPeter Burchard\r\nMarcus Balog\r\nAnnamaria Lu\r\nHussain Tolba\r\nNathan Schlesinger\r\nJackson Temple\r\nEshan Gupta\r\nAndrew Lambdin-Abraham\r\nAlia El Ghamrawy\r\nAli Chamberlain\r\nJulian Mallet\r\nLaura Decker\r\nVladimir Lilov\r\nAndrew Foster\r\nReghan Ward\r\nHisham Abdelaziz\r\nTyler Jacobson\r\nBrad Baker\r\nBrycen Rushing\r\nJerry Benson\r\nAbbas Fadel\r\nBobby Gibbs\r\nDevin Donnelly\r\nVitalily Boksiner\r\nBob Fiegel\r\nGary VanderWege\r\nAaron Wheatley\r\nTommy Manly\r\nMatt Goode\r\nJacob DeWeese\r\nDaniel Diep\r\nVivian Ting","venue":{"name":"Irving Convention Center","address":"500 W Las Colinas Blvd","city":"Irving","state":"TX","zip":"75039","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8777052,"longitude":-96.9431448,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":126132,"tournament_id":31961,"tournament":"Winter Games of Texas - Foil\/Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"Y10 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y10WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-01-24T08:00:00-06:00","fee":"120.00"}]},{"id":31962,"name":"Winter Games of Texas - Foil\/Epee\/Sabre","start_date":"2016-01-23","end_date":"2016-01-24","comments":"We are proud to partner with the TAAF and the City of Frisco to host the Winter Games of Texas.Fencers from ALL states are welcome to compete.Reg closes Jan 8th.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament.

NJFA has helped enrich the lives of hundreds of young children and their families. Along the way our students have experienced exceptional success both athletically and academically.  NJFA is proud to have assisted so many students to earn scholarships for colleges including Division I programs not to mention the hundreds of students that have utilized the NJFA network to assist in college acceptance and employment.\r\n\r\nEVENT\r\n\r\nDr. D'Ambola is a legend in US fencing. He is an outstanding left handed fencer and was a member of the undefeated Seton Hall University team, several times state champion in individual and in team events. He coached Essex Catholic High School for 14 years. During his time, his fencers won nine team state championships, 8 Cetrullo Tournament Championships and 2 greater New York Championships. Dr. D'Ambola is an inducted member of the National Fencing Hall of Fame, Seton Hall University Hall of Fame, Newark Athletic Hall of Fame, Essex Catholic High School Hall of Fame and was inducted into the NJSIAA hall of fame last year.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) is sanctioned by USA Fencing and their Youth Development Committee (YDC). RYCs are a group of events in each region throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y10, Y12, and Y14 age categories in all three weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn regional points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families.The Y8 events listed are additional approved events and not part of the RYC.\r\n \r\nRYC's are one of the possible qualification paths for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\n\r\nThe USFA has made significant changes with respect to eligibility and qualification paths.  \r\nWe are providing the following information \/ schedule, for your convenience.  \r\n\r\nBeginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at the Summer Nationals will be National Championships. \r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) has been instituted to recognize participation and accomplishments of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. \r\nYouth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. The USFA has approved an abundance of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, only their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. \r\nFor more details please visit http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/5402\/2014-2015_Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative.pdf\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC.
