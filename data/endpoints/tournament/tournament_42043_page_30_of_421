This one time could include the same day on which the team event occurs.  Individuals do not qualify for teams, clubs qualify for teams with the potential for individual fencers who represent the club at nationals to be completely different from those who represent the club at the qualifier.  Five clubs are allowed to qualify without fencing, therefore, if less than 6 clubs pre-register, all qualify and no fencing will occur.  To help defray tournament expenses, no trophies will be given to non-contested events.  Team events are seeded according fencer classification of the same weapon.   No division patches are given for team events, but will be awarded for non-contested individual events.  For further information, please check the complete rules for qualifiers in the electronic news sent to each USFA member or the confirmation materials included with registration for national events, or contact the division secretary.\r\n\r\nTeam captains who wish to qualify their team must check-in with the names of their team members at the appropriate times.  For Saturday's events, check is is by 10 a.m. Saturday (for Saturday's events.)  For Sunday's events, check-in closes at 3 p.m. on Saturday for Sunday's events.  If the captain does not check-in with the names of the team at or before the correct time, the team will forfeit.  If less than 6 teams pre-register by the deadline (April 20) the events will not be fenced, but team captains still must submit team members. \r\n\r\nTHERE ARE NO COMBINED TEAMS... YOU MUST REPRESENT THE SAME PRIMARY CLUB\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive (i.e., Junior, Life, Senior, Veteran) members of the USFA and citizens or permanent residents of the United States.  Fencers may join the USFA at the door.  Please bring your completed USFA membership form and signed waiver with you.  USFA cards must be presented at check-in if you do not appear on or if your classification is different from the Current Members List online.   Fencers under 18 must have a waiver signed by parents.  Waiver may be downloaded from the website and signed by parents prior to the tournament.  Coaches\u00a1\u00a6 signature is not valid and will NOT be accepted.  \r\n\r\nYou may also mail your registration information and pre-payment to:  \r\nALM Divisional  10000 Chase Island Shreveport, La.  71118 \r\nFax to:  318-686-9975 ATTN: Terry Harkey or call (318) 458-3779\r\n\r\nDIVISION\/SECTION\/SUMMER NATIONAL QUALIFYING COMPETITIONS AGE RESTRICTIONS\r\nDiv 2\/3 - 1993\r\nY14 - 1992-1995\r\nCadet - 1991-1994\r\n(or on NRPS for the next younger age bracket)\r\n\r\nTeams are considered Div 1\/2\/3 (open) fencers must be born in 1993 or earlier or be on the NRPS in the Junior category of the same weapon.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Sword Sports","address":"447 N.

Especially 2.5 (Eligibility to Compete); 2.7 (What is a Qualifier); 2.8 (Appeal\/Petition Process); and 2.11 (Specific Events). We also recommend that you know, by heart, the qualifying paths for any events you want to fence in at nationals, which can be read on pages 19-29 of the Athlete's Handbook.\r\n<li>You MUST show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and WILL NOT be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration. BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n<li>As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse. We will be highly unsympathetic towards any excuses short of natural disaster, war and\/or death (and for those at war, you technically belong to the National Division, so even that won't work!).\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/01\/2007.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/27\/2007.","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"180 Central Park South","city":"New
