Teams of 3 or 4 people limited to 6 teams. \r\n\r\nFencers must create teams of 3 fencers, they may optionally include 1 alternate.\r\n\r\nFor pools fencers assign their strongest fencer to their A spot, their mid fencer to their B spot, and their weakest to their C spot. \r\n\r\nAll A spot fencers fence in a pool, B slot fencers in a pool, and C slot fencers in a pool.

Example, Team 1 versus Team 4, each fencer fences a five touch bout against each fencer on the other team. The first team to win 5 bouts wins and advances to the next round. \r\n\r\nIf an alternate is present the alternate must be subbed in permanently in the pool round. No fencer may fence in more than one slot (A,B,C). \r\n\r\nSubstitutions may be in and out in the DE round so long as no fencer fences the same person twice. Substitutions must be announced at least one bout before the bout where the substitution will occur.\r\n\r\nDuring DEs each team is allowed 1 time out of 30 seconds per bout. Time outs may be called between \"halt\" and \"fence\" but not during fencing action. \r\n\r\nTeams may have 1 non-fencing captain or coach in attendance.

Each team member will fence the other team's representative in their weapon, i.e. your epeeist will fence the epeeist on the other team. Just like a normal Team bout, first to a certain number wins! 15 touches is the goal. \r\n\r\nThis is always a good time, and the members of the winning team will have their names put on the Mile High Team Trophy.\r\n\r\nPlease form a team before preregistration ends and email your team name, club, and team members' names and weapons to frontdesk@denverfencingcenter.com Remember that each team must have 1 foil, 1 epee, and 1 saber fencer, and must have at least 1 female and 1 male on the team.  \r\n\r\nIf you would like to fence but you're having trouble finding a team, email frontdesk@denverfencingcenter.com with your information and tell John you would like to be a floater.  \r\n\r\nTo check on teams and available floaters, see the following Mile High Team Tournament Google Doc: \r\nhttps:\/\/bit.ly\/30WIu3o\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/31\/2021.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/10\/2021.","venue":{"name":"Denver Fencing Center","address":"1930 South Navajo Street","city":"Denver","state":"CO","zip":"80223","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":39.6817055,"longitude":-105.0037848,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":48,"name":"Colorado","abbrev":"CO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":189788,"tournament_id":48690,"tournament":"Mile High 3 Weapon Team Tournament @ DFC","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-09-11T11:45:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":48707,"name":"Foiled again Epee","start_date":"2021-09-11","end_date":"","comments":"Open Foil and Epee and Youth Foil and Epee\r\n\r\nThese events will be self directed!","prereg_open":"2021-08-31","prereg_close":"2021-09-10","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Join us for the Foiled Again Epee event.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY10 & Y12 Mixed Epee\r\nY10 & Y12 Mixed Foil\r\nSenior Mixed Epee -

No cash refunds.\r\n\r\n@@Screaming@@\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/15\/2021\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Important: Please provide contact information (name, telephone, e-mail) at the table, so that buyers may be in touch with sellers. Many new fencers may be looking to purchase used equipment for the first time.
