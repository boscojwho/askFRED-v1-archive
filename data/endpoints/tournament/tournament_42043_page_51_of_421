Turn left at this light and immediately turn right onto Hwy. 41 North (turn right before going under the bridge) After about 2 miles (after the traffic light,) turn right to exit onto Hwy. 411 South\/Hwy. 20 West.\r\n\r\nAfter about 18 miles and 4 traffic lights, get in the right lane and take the middle exit ramp (the sign above the ramp says \"Rome\") This road turns into Turner McCall Blvd as it goes into town.\r\n\r\nStay on Turner McCall Blvd. for about 3.5 miles. At this point (at the intersection of Horseleg Creek Rd,) the road changes names to Shorter Ave.\r\n\r\nLess than 1\/4 mile from the intersection at Horseleg Creek Rd, turn left at the traffic light onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign here also says \"Shorter College.\" After turning, take an immediate left, and go through the security gate.\r\n\r\nThe road will fork shortly after the security gate. Stay to the left. You will go around an \"S\" curve. You will see a large parking lot after going around the curve. The Winthrop-King Center will be on your left, downhill from the parking lot.  \r\n________________________________________\r\nComing From Huntsville \r\nTake Highway 72 to the Tennessee River (Scotsboro.) Go over the river (I think the bridge over the river is Highway 35.) After going over the river, take Highway 40 to I-59. Go over I-59 and take Highway 117 through Hammondville and Mentone and into Georgia. After you reach Cloudland, GA, take Highway 48 to Summerville. From Summerville, take Highway 27 South, which goes into Rome.\r\n \r\nAfter you pass the traffic light at Mount Berry Square Mall and the one at Berry College, Highway 20 will turn into Martha Berry Blvd. Stay on Martha Berry Blvd. until you get to Turner McCall Blvd (Wallgreens will be on your right.) Turn right, and go through two traffic lights. Less that 1\/4 mile after the 3rd light (Horseleg Creek Rd,) turn left onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign here also says \"Shorter College.\" After turning, take an immediate left, and go through the security gate.\r\n\r\nThe road will fork shortly after the security gate. Stay to the left. You will go around an \"S\" curve. You will see a large parking lot after going around the curve. The Winthrop-King Center will be on your left, downhill from the parking lot.  \r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\nComing From Birmingham \r\nTake I-59 to Gadsden (via I-759) After I-759 ends, take Highway 411 North\/East to Centre. From Centre, take Highway 20 East into Rome. Highway 20 turns into Shorter Ave. Take Shorter Ave. through town. After you pass Sams Club and Wal Mart (on your left,) keep going for a little over two miles. Take a right at a traffic light onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign at here also says \"Shorter College.\" (Buffalo's Restaurant will be on the left shortly before you turn.)

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"waiting\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Waiting list policy:<\/b>\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"policy\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24740,"tournament_id":5417,"tournament":"Philadelphia Novice Y14\/Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-01T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":24741,"tournament_id":5417,"tournament":"Philadelphia Novice Y14\/Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-01T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":27883,"tournament_id":5417,"tournament":"Philadelphia Novice Y14\/Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5706,"name":"Liberty Cup June 1st","start_date":"2008-06-01","end_date":"","comments":"$35 if paid through asfred, $45 at the door.

This year, there will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2007-2008 age requirements: \r\nYouth-8:  born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12: born in 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14: born in 1993-1996\r\n\r\n(Fencers who are on the USFA national point standings in one age bracket are also eligible to compete in the next higher age bracket.)\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.  The first series ended at Youth Progressive #4 and was based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4; the second series will end at <b>this tournament<\/b> and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8.  Trophies will be awarded at <b>this tournament<\/b> for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil, Youth-12 Foil, Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.  \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1.  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event.  If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2.  Events are mixed (boys and girls).  Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender.  (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3.  Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments.  Point standings will be posted at www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4.  The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series.  For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n------------------\r\nSchedule (close of registration times & award ceremony times):\r\n\r\n9:00am: Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n10:30am Y8 Foil\r\n12:30pm Awards ceremony for Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee & Y8 Foil\r\n\r\n1:00pm: Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil\r\n2:30: Y12 Epee\r\n5:00pm Awards ceremony for Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil & Y12 Epee\r\n-------------------\r\nCost: $10 preregistration fee ($15 at the door), plus $10 per event.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for fencers born in 2000 or earlier years, and can be purchased or renewed online or at the door.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2007.\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/13\/2008.","venue":{"name":"NorthWest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Ave","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.48434,"longitude":-122.782564,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":20167,"tournament_id":4391,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #8 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-14T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20169,"tournament_id":4391,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #8 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-14T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20170,"tournament_id":4391,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #8 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-14T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20171,"tournament_id":4391,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #8 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-14T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20172,"tournament_id":4391,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #8 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-14T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5421,"name":"Philadelphia Open Sabre","start_date":"2008-06-14","end_date":"","comments":"Limit - 36 fencers.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24745,"tournament_id":5421,"tournament":"Philadelphia Open Sabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":22,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-06-14T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5939,"name":"EUF Epee Open","start_date":"2008-06-14","end_date":"2008-06-15","comments":"$35 if paid through AskFred.
