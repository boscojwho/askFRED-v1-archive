Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/17\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35936,"tournament_id":8064,"tournament":"Novice Cadet & Adult Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-19T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":8323,"name":"RCFC Youth #4 (08-09)","start_date":"2009-04-19","end_date":"","comments":"RCFC presents another youth foil tournament.

You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 1998-2001\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1996-1999\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=8323\r\nPreregistation closes on 04\/18\/2009\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

All paid registrations are manually approved and do not show immediately in the registration list.  We check secondary club or school affiliation, USFA member status and USFA member #.  If you will be joining at the door, just put in a single digit in the USFA membership # field.\r\n<li>Registration CLOSED at midnight on Monday, April 20.\r\n<li>Refund requests should be sent to Club Treasurer Patric Wallace at patric@thewallacegroupinc.com. Refund requests will only be considered from those who cancel BEFORE the tournament in enough time that it doesn't cost the Club money because of contractual arrangements with officials.\r\n<li>Check-in closes promptly at 6:00pm.  Fencing does not have access to the school until 5:15.  Please do not enter the school before then.\r\n<li>Full uniform including knickers, long socks and plastron required.\r\n<li>Check your weapons; weights and shims will be used.\r\n\r\nQuestions?

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/23\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35937,"tournament_id":8065,"tournament":"Open Sabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":29,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-25T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":8077,"name":"Wyoming State Divisionals Individual & Teams","start_date":"2009-04-25","end_date":"","comments":"$15 for first weapon, $10 for each additional weapon.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Foil \r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/24\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35938,"tournament_id":8066,"tournament":"\"D\" Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":17,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-04-26T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":8324,"name":"Full Circle Foil","start_date":"2009-04-26","end_date":"","comments":"Preregistration deadline: April 21.

York Athletic Club<\/div>\r\n\r\nPlease read the following information carefully to ensure a happy qualifying event for everybody!\r\n\r\nYou must pre-register AND complete online payment by the entry deadline (04\/30\/09) to be fully registered.\r\nYou CAN register at the door, however there is an extra $10 late fee PER EVENT. After you register and complete online payment, confirm that your name appears under the correct events in the \"Whose Pre-registered\" list.\r\n\r\n<b>To compete in Metropolitan Section\/Division Qualifiers, you must:<\/b><br>\r\n<ol><li>Bring your USFA card with you to the eventBe on time. Don't bother trying to call us... you are either there or you aren't. We will not be holding up events for you.<br>&nbsp;<br><li>Belong, as stated on the USFA card you will have with you and\/or the USFA membership list, to the Metropolitan Division\/Section. If your USFA card and the USFA membership list do not show that you belong to the Metropolitan Division\/Section, we absolutely positively will not let you fence. We don't care where your family lives, where you go to school, what club you occasionally practice at, who you talked to at the national office, or what your favorite ice cream flavor is...<br>&nbsp;<br><li>Be of the correct age for the events you are participating in:<br>\r\n\r\nAge Restictions for National Championships\r\nPer chapter 2.5 of the Athletes Handbook (Eligibility to Compete):\r\n\r\n<div style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Event (Birthyear)<\/div>\r\nD1A \/ D2 \/ D3 \/ Senior Team (1995 or earlier)\r\nJunior \/ Junior Team (1990-1996)\r\nCadet (1993-1996)\r\nYouth 14 (1994-1997)\r\nYouth 12 (1996-1999)\r\nYouth 10 (1998-2001)\r\n\r\nThere is no leeway for \"close\" in the above guidelines. If your birthday was December 31st before the minimum year or January 1st after the latest year of the event you want to be in, tough cookies.\r\n<\/ol>\r\n<b>Division 3 Qualification to National Championships<\/b><br>\r\nPlease note that per USFA guidelines there are no Division 3 qualifying events. Qualification for Division 3 events is through qualification in Div 1A, Div 2, U19 or U16 in the same weapon, or by placing in the top 25% of D & Under fencers in the Division 2 qualifying event that don't otherwise qualify. Therefore if you want to qualify for Division 3 events, it is recommended that you enter the Division 2 qualifying event in the same weapon.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Notes<\/b><br>\r\n<ul><li>We strongly recommend that all fencers interested in attending national championships read chapter 2 in the Athletes Handbook. Especially 2.5 (Eligibility to Compete); 2.7 (What is a Qualifier); 2.8 (Appeal\/Petition Process); and 2.11 (Specific Events). We also recommend that you know, by heart, the qualifying paths for any events you want to fence in at nationals, which can be read on pages 19-29 of the Athlete's Handbook located here: http:\/\/usfencing.org\/content\/index\/3812\r\n<br><li>You MUST show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and WILL NOT be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration.<br>&nbsp;<br><li>BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n<\/ul><br>As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse. We will be highly unsympathetic towards any excuses short of natural disaster, war and\/or death (and for those at war, you technically belong to the National Division, so even that won't work!).\r\n\r\n<b>Location<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe New York Athletic Club is located at 180 Central Park South, in Manhattan. Please use the 58th Street Entrance at the NE corner of 58th St and 7th Ave, under the green NYAC awning.\r\n\r\n<b>Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nSeveral garages in the area give discounts to NYAC guests, including most on 58th street both east and west of 7th avenue. Make sure to look for the NYAC winged foot sign at the garage entrance, and ask the NYAC desk guard to validate your ticket before you leave the club.\r\n\r\nNote: This info is to help you... we do not guarantee any discounts whatsoever. If you are looking for free street parking, we recommend the Upper West Side between 63rd and 70th, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th St around 10th Ave.","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic
