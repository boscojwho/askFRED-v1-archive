You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale or rental. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2011-2014\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2005-2008\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=44836\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/17\/2020\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":177485,"tournament_id":44836,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #3","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-18T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177486,"tournament_id":44836,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":14,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-18T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177487,"tournament_id":44836,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #3","full_name":"Y12 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y12WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-18T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177488,"tournament_id":44836,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #3","full_name":"Y12 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y12MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-18T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177490,"tournament_id":44836,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":24,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-18T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":45888,"name":"Great Lakes Junior Varsity Championship","start_date":"2020-01-18","end_date":"","comments":"Registration closes at 11:59 PM on Thursday, January 16.

All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome!

The rules for the tournament will be posted down below. The rules may be subject to change before the tournament so please be sure to check them periodically. \r\n\r\nAll participants will have to sign a waiver before partaking in the tournament, you do not need a USFA membership to compete.\r\n\r\nThis is a dry tournament! Although you may use your electric weapons there are no scoring machines and the bouts are visually judged.\r\n\r\nIf you arrive late we may be able to squeeze you into the pools. However, if you arrive after the pool bouts have ended then we can't fit you into that section of the tournament. \r\n\r\nEach event is done one at a time, meaning when we finish one event we move onto the next event.\r\n\r\nIf there are any questions please contact me here: redhatroger0@gmail.com\r\n\r\nGeneral Rules: \r\n1. Do not argue with the referee!-the refs we get are volunteers and will not tolerate a rude fencer\r\n2. No yelling on the strip.-screaming after receiving a touch is obnoxious, we aren't at the Olympics or world championships so there is no need to like you are.\r\n3. The clock doesn't stop for anything.-each bout is five minutes long and time will continue to expire even when the director calls halt. So I would reconsider arguing for points.\r\n4. No pistol grips in small sword.-you can only use a french grip in the small sword tournament.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

She battled and defeated navies from the British Empire, the Portuguese Empire, the East India Trading Co. and the Qing Dynasty before eventually being granted amnesty by the Chinese emperor and retiring to a life of luxury with all of her pirated riches.\r\n\r\nAs Pirate Queen, she enacted a strict code of laws governing the behavior of her pirates toward towns that helped them, the orderly sharing of any seized loot, and the behavior of her pirates toward any women who were captured.\r\n\r\nBuccaneer Blades Fencing is hosting this women-only tournament to celebrate women in fencing and raise awareness about domestic violence. \r\n\r\n\r\nRegistration: $20\r\nSanctioned Events: $20\r\n\r\nUnique Prizes awarded to 1st, 2nd and 3rd places!\r\n\r\nChing Shih T-shirts will be available for $15.\r\n\r\nFor local hotel reservations, you can use the Group Code \"BUC\" at the Wentzville Hampton Inn: https:\/\/www.hilton.com\/en\/hotels\/stlwzhx-hampton-st-louis-wentzville or by calling 636-445-3780. \r\n<b>Group rates only good through January 17th.<\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Women's Epee\r\nSenior Women's Foil\r\nSenior Women's Saber\r\nUnsanctioned Women's Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/24\/2020.","venue":{"name":"Buccaneer Blades Fencing","address":"1236 Continental Dr.","city":"Wentzville","state":"MO","zip":"63385","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":38.8102788,"longitude":-90.8394047,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":36,"name":"St. Louis","abbrev":"STL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":174191,"tournament_id":44045,"tournament":"3rd Annual Ching Shih - Pirate Queen (Women Only)","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Women's Foil","short_name":"U-WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-26T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":174192,"tournament_id":44045,"tournament":"3rd Annual Ching Shih - Pirate Queen (Women Only)","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-25T11:00:00-06:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":174193,"tournament_id":44045,"tournament":"3rd Annual Ching Shih - Pirate Queen (Women Only)","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-01-25T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":45840,"name":"AIC Saturday Night Foil","start_date":"2020-01-25","end_date":"","comments":"Please join us for the AIC Saturday Night events.
