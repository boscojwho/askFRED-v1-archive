Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10021","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661675,"longitude":-73.9793986,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":126684,"tournament_id":32084,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":126685,"tournament_id":32084,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":126686,"tournament_id":32084,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":126687,"tournament_id":32084,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-04-17T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":33116,"name":"FVFA Novice Foil Youth Team Tournament","start_date":"2016-04-17","end_date":"","comments":"$15 per fencer.

This team will be headed by one or two coaches, chosen from all of that school district\u0092s coaches.  Normally there is a participation limit of one girls team and one boys team per school district, but this year we are waiving this rule in order to field as many teams possible.  Therefore each school district may enter as many teams and fencers as they wish for the All-State tournament.  \r\n\r\nAs an example of how we in the San Francisco High School District choose our All-State team.  We select our team members at our S.F. All-City Tournament, which is held at the end of the fencing season at an individual boys and girls event.  For the boy\u0092s team, up to an additional four boys are voted by all coaches as the All-City Team.  At the end of the All-City Meet, a boy\u0092s team and girl\u0092s team plus coaches are selected from all of our high schools to represent San Francisco in the All-State Tournament.\r\n\r\nThe All-State tournament this year will host girls and boys individual events.  We encourage each district to field any number of girls they wish in a girl\u0092s individual tournament.  The format for both the boys and girls events will be pools, followed by direct eliminations with fence-off for third, where points will be earned by the final placing.  The total points for the top three placing girls or boys from each district will be added together to determine the first place school districts in the girls and boys teams event.  \r\nThe first place team trophy for boys and the first place team trophy for girls are perpetual trophies, which have been in the school systems for years.\r\n\r\nTo enter a team, a letter requesting a seat in the All-State tournament is needed from each school district wishing to participate. \r\nThis letter is requested, along with $30.00 (to cover the costs of prizes and gym rental).  Please make out the check to Pannonia Athletic Club, and bring both to the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst place boys team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\nFirst place girls team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\n\r\nThere will also be 24 medals awarded for:\r\n\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place teams (boys and girls, 3 medals per team)\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place individual(boys and girls)\r\n\r\nNO USFA membership is required, no ratings will be awarded. \r\nAll other USFA rules and regulations apply.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Halberstadt Fencers' Club","address":"621 S.

That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event.

Additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals. The top 40% of finishers in D1A and D2\/3 will receive points. Any fencer who accumulates points over the course of the season will qualify.  If a fencer qualifies via points for Div1A and is rating eligible, they will also qualify for Div 2\/3.Fencers who qualify for Div II and meet classification requirements for Div III will also qualify for Div III. Foreign fencers with a current FIE license can participate but foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USFA national championships.\r\nThe Athlete\u0092s Handbook:(http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698380-athlete-handbook) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for summer nationals and should be used as the appropriate reference document. \r\nThis particular ROC is in honor of Coach Jeff Wolfe. It is with a heavy heart that we must inform everyone that Coach Wolfe has passed away. This event is now held in his memory. Jeff Wolfe, a longtime coach at Brentwood High School, fenced at New York University. After graduating he became a teacher at Brentwood High School where he began both a Boys' Team and a Girls' Team. The Girls' Team was the first girls' varsity program on Long Island. During his tenure (1971- 1998) the Girls' Team had 18 undefeated seasons, 19 League Championships and 18 Sectional Championships. The team set a N. Y. State record winning 98 consecutive dual meets. Jeff Wolfe's W-L record at Brentwood was 388-14. Eight of his fencers became collegiate All- Americans. Four represented the United States in international competition. In 1987, he was the first recipient of the NFCAA Regional Coach Of the Year Award. In 1988 he was named to coach the US Cadet Team at the Continental Cadet Championships and the World Cadet Championships. Coach Wolfe was a highly respected member of the fencing community, and is greatly missed by all those who knew him.\r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net.

Event time(s) for each event will be set not later than 4\/20\/16.\r\n\r\nPlease see the USA Fencing Athlete Handbook for qualification paths and requirements.  \r\n\r\nRegistration is now closed.  There is NO walk-in registration for this tournament. USA Fencing and Indiana Division membership required.\r\n \r\nEvents will be fenced ONLY if there are more than three competitors. The direct elimination round will be fenced to determine each place (no tie for third). If three or less fencers register for the event, and even though the event will not be fenced those eligible fencers will be considered qualified. \r\n\r\nThere is a $10\/event charge for events (if fenced).\r\n\r\nBe advised, USA Fencing rules allow qualification for VET events at Summer Nationals via division qualification. Qualification occurs by \"competing\" in a DIV II\/DIV III event for the weapon you would be interested in fencing for VET's at Summer Nationals. Qualification is limited to DIV II\/DIV III eligible fencers rated C and Below. Qualification for VET events is not dependent on your placement in the DIV II\/III qualifier (and is therefore automatic based solely on participation). However, any placement within the top 25% would additionally qualify you to compete in a DIV II\/DIV III event as allowed by your placement and classification. Therefore, a separate VET qualifier is not necessary, and will not be fenced. \r\n\r\nYour registration is now being reviewed to ensure it complies with the requirements for participation and qualification through this event, to include - current season USFA Membership, ability to represent the USA with proper citizenship, Indiana Division designation, and proper rating or age status for events in which you are seeking to qualify.\r\n\r\n As the registration is now closed, but, subject to final verification, based on initial participation, the following events will not be fenced on Saturday.\r\n\r\n Women's DIV II\/III Epee\r\n Women's DIV II\/III Foil\r\n Women's DIV II\/III Sabre\r\n NO Y14 Men or Women's Foil\/Sabre\/Epee\r\n\r\nThe fencers who were pre-registered for these events are now considered auto qualified, provided they meet the qualification requirements of participation in Summer Nationals or July Challenge this summer.\r\n\r\nAll qualifying events that will be fenced - DIV II\/III Men's Epee, DIV II\/III Men's Foil - will be afternoon starts approximately 30 - 45 minutes after the conclusion of their weapon counterpart event in the Firebird Cup. \r\n\r\nTherefore, here are the approximate start times for the following events:\r\n\r\nDIV II\/III Men's Epee - 1P\r\nDIV II\/III Men's Foil - 3P\r\n\r\nIf you are fencing in the Firebird Cup, you will already be at venue in advance of these times so further planning is unnecessary; however, if you are not fencing in Firebird Cup, you should plan to be at venue at least 30 minutes prior to the above posted times to allow for variations in the approximated times.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fencer in any of the qualifying events, you should ensure that you are in compliance with the requirements of participation and qualification as noted above. Your failure to do so could invalidate your ability to qualify in this event for Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nFinal results, if applicable, and ALL qualifying notices with instructions for registering for Summer Nationals with USA Fencing will be sent to qualifying fencers NLT Sunday, April, 24, 2016.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you may contact me, if by email at larry@indianafencing.org or by phone at 317-344-9088.\r\n\r\nThank you and good luck,\r\n\r\nLarry Shipp\r\n\r\nLarry Shipp\r\nChair, Indiana Division USA Fencing \r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/20\/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Indianapolis Fencing Club","address":"7606 E 82nd Street","city":"Indianapolis","state":"IN","zip":"46256","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9059342,"longitude":-86.033889,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":19,"name":"Indiana","abbrev":"IN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":129893,"tournament_id":32932,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Women's DIV II\/III Foil","short_name":"Dv2WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":129894,"tournament_id":32932,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Women's DIV II\/III Saber","short_name":"Dv2WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":129895,"tournament_id":32932,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Men's DIV II\/III Epee","short_name":"Dv2ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":129896,"tournament_id":32932,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Men's DIV II\/III Foil","short_name":"Dv2MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":129897,"tournament_id":32932,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Men's DIV II\/III Saber","short_name":"Dv2MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":129900,"tournament_id":32932,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":129902,"tournament_id":32932,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":32933,"name":"Firebird Cup","start_date":"2016-04-23","end_date":"","comments":"Join us this spring for the 5th annual Firebird Cup at Indianapolis Fencing Club's fencing facility in Indianapolis.

If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.

It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.\r\n \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.
