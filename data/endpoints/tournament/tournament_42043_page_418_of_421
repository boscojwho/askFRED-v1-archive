In order for fencers to grow as athletes, boundaries and guidelines must be set regarding the expectations of how parents, coaches and spectators will act.\r\n\r\n<b>Marx Fencing Academy Conduct Standards<\/b>\r\n\r\nOur competition will strictly adhere to USA Fencing Codes of Conduct, as well as SafeSport Guidelines including MAAP resources. In addition, our tournament has a specific set of guidelines outlined below. Every individual within our facility is expected to be familiar with, and adhere to these behavior expectations:\r\n\r\n<li>Show encouragement to all fencers.\r\n<li>Keep comments positive.\r\n<li>Respect personal and professional boundaries of fencers, referees and coaches by providing space and keeping safe distances away from the fencing floor.\r\n<li>Allow coaches and team leaders to coach, support and give advice to their fencers.\r\n<li>Volunteer if you want to be more involved: bout committee, food runs, photography or becoming an armorer are just a few ways our community can be supported.\r\n<li>Leave officiating to the officials.\r\n<li>Avoid or ignore drama and unnecessary controversy that is unproductive.\r\n<li>Help make our events a positive experience for us all.\r\n<li>Report disruptions of these agreements to any tournament staff member.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Marx Fencing Academy, visit: https:\/\/www.marxfencingacademy.com\/\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Notes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>You can reach Marx Fencing by email at michael@marxfencingacademy.com.<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>If you would like to register for the Vivo event visit: https:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/moreInfo.php?tournament_id=53102","venue":{"name":"Marx Fencing Academy","address":"19 Keefe Road","city":"Acton","state":"MA","zip":"01720","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":42.4729725,"longitude":-71.407069,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":206461,"tournament_id":53160,"tournament":"June 4 @ Marx Fencing Foil NE Developmental","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":16,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-06-04T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":206462,"tournament_id":53160,"tournament":"June 4 @ Marx Fencing Foil NE Developmental","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":22,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2023-06-04T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":207806,"tournament_id":53160,"tournament":"June 4 @ Marx Fencing Foil NE Developmental","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":53165,"name":"NSFC Vladimir Gofman Memorial Senior M\/W Epee","start_date":"2023-06-04","end_date":"","comments":"Doors open 1 hour prior to close of registration for the event.
