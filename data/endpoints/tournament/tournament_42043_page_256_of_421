So allow time for that check. Due to the early checkin, the armory will be open starting Friday, Feb 20. If you live in the area and can come by early for armory checks please do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Nationals and Point System: Regional Youth Circuit guidelines found here:\r\nhttp:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0071\/9470\/2015_2016_RYC_Guidelines_Final.pdf\r\ndetail these relationships.\r\n\r\nAbout the area:\r\nThere are several restaurants within easy walking distance, Denny's, Wendy's, Starbucks, Togo's, Jack In The Box and a Mexican taqueria. But there are numerous restaurants within a short drive including Vietnam Town, an Asian themed shopping district with many fine restaurants and \"Plant Shopping Center\", your familiar large outdoor mall.\r\n\r\nAuto Parking: TFC has 50 parking spots. The curb directly in front of the building is a bicycle lane and tickets are issued for parking there. The Walmart Market just down the street has graciously allowed us to use their parking lot. They are approximately a 8 minute walk from TFC. Please park toward the street and avoid their customers or the north wall where their associates park. It is suggested that fencers be dropped off with their gear at the front of the venue before parking cars. Note that the Walmart is a grocery outlet and carries full line of sport drinks, fruits and snacks.

See USFA ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\n\r\n\u0095 SYC Competitions award points to the top 40% of the field regardless of where the cut off occurs, within a pool round of a direct elimination bracket. For example, if there are 17 fencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8. Only the top 6 finishers, not the top 7 finishers, earn points. \r\n\r\n\u0095 CADET events are not qualifiers and do not award regional points.   \r\n\r\n\u0095 Format for all events is one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. \r\nPools: All events will use pools of six or seven whenever possible. In events with fewer than 11 entrants, the BC may elect to have two rounds of pools followed by 100% promoted to a DE (direct elimination) tableau. There is no fence-off for third place.

DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. \r\n<i>Y10 DE format: <\/i>10-touch bouts (two periods of 3 minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period). The first period ends either at the expiration of 3 minutes or when the score reaches 5 touches on one side, whichever comes first.

During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n<i>Cadet DE format: <\/i>15 touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute break between). During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Seeding for SYC pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. Seeding for CADET pool round will use National Cadet ranking within classification, then classification\/year. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. No classification or affiliation changes will be made at the event. Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during tournament: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT PREPARATION GUIDES<\/b>\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\nThese guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments.\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html (courtesy of fencing.net)\r\nParents Guide to Fencing: http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html (courtesy of Fencing.net)\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n<b>ABOUT COBRA FENCING CLUB<\/b>\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\nLocated at: 629 Grove Street; Jersey City, NJ (http:\/\/www.cobrafencing.com)\r\n\r\nSteve Kaplan - Club owner\/Coach \r\n\u0095 (U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Fencing Master)\r\n\u0095 1976 U.S. Olympic Team Member \u0096 Sabre.\r\n\u0095 1975 Pan American Games Silver Medalist.\r\n\u0095 4 time U.S. National Team Champion.\r\n\u0095 1971 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All American \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Varsity Head Fencing Coach NYU 1980-1986.\r\n\u0095 Elected to NYU Athletic Hall of Fame 1996.\r\n\u0095 Founded Cobra Fencing Club in 2002.\r\n\r\nDemetrios \u0093Mitro\u0094 Valsamis \u0096 Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 Under-19 U.S. Foil Champion 1979, 1980.\r\n\u0095 Cadet Sabre Champion 1976, 1977.\r\n\u0095 1983 NCAA Foil Champion \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095 Foil Coach at Cobra since 2003.\r\n\r\nRaskyrie (Ras) Davidson - Coach\r\n\r\n\u0095 2005, 2006, 2007 United States Junior World Team Member\r\n\u0095 2006 World Cadet Saber Bronze Medalist\r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Cadet Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2005 Junior Olympics Junior Saber Champion \r\n\u0095 2004 United States National Cadet Saber Champion\r\n\r\nCobra Fencing Club is a member of the NJ Division of USA Fencing (http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org). \r\nSince Cobra\u0092s inception it has sought to foster the development of youth fencing.

So if you're coming, get your friends to sign up! Get the number of entries over 12 and win an epee!\r\n\r\nWe will run the Mixed Random Draw Team Epee if people still want to fence some more.  It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  No Y12 fencers in the team event, sorry.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  If we have a lot of people signed up we may use some imagination in the format; last year, for example, we ran a pool of teams, each round to a multiple of 3 rather than 5, each round to a max of 1 minute rather than 3.  At any rate, it will be a lot of fencing but will not go on until midnight.  \r\n\r\nIt's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gulfcoastfencing.org\/GCwaiverconsent.pdf\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it's about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.

Y10 events must use #2 blades.\r\n\r\nUPDATED USFA Y 10\/12\/14 RYC  RULES:\r\n\r\n1) For Y10 and Y12, any fencer competing in an RYC with at least 2 fencers in their event, will continue to meet the qualification standard for the March NAC. However, any RYC held before the March NAC but AFTER the deadline for entry will NOT be considered for qualification to this tournament.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) The Y10 and Y12 events at SN this season will be National Championships. The Y10 path remains participation in an RYC = qualification.  For Y12, the RYC path is the top 50% of the fencers on their Regions point standings will qualify.  Foreign Fencers will be skipped and the next eligible fencer will qualify as these events are now National Championships. The SYC\/NAC NRPS points path remains the same.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3) The winner of a Y14 RYC will NO longer earn automatic qualification to SNs.  Rather, at the end of the season, the top 25% on each region's list will qualify.  The SYC\/NAC NRPS path remains the same and the division qualifiers for Y14 are still in place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are fewer than 5 fencers in any gender for that age\/weapon.\r\n\r\nPreregistration Closing Date 11\/22\/2015\r\n\r\n2013-2014 Age Classification USFA restriction rules:\r\n\r\n YOUTH 14..........YOUTH 12.........YOUTH 10\r\n 2001-2004.........2003-2006........2005-2008\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 28, 2015\r\n9:00 a.m.:  Y14 Foil \r\n2:00 p.m.:  Y14 Epee\r\n1:00 p.m.:  Y14 Sabre\r\n3:00 p.m.:  Y10 Foil\r\n9:00 a.m.:  Y10 Epee\r\n4:00 p.m.:  Y10 Sabre\r\n\r\nSunday, November 29 , 2015\r\n9:00 a.m.  Y12 Epee\r\n12:00 a.m.  Y12 Foil\r\n2:00 p.m.  Y12 Sabre \r\n\r\nPlease note:  The above times are the close of registration.

The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n     \r\n    The conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\n    In order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\n    The conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Windy City Fencing Club","address":"1535 N Dayton

fencing to commence immediately afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in multiple sessions, but only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a stoppage at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12 and Y14 event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 and Y10 events will use #2 or #0 weapons.\r\nY12 and Y14 will use #5 weapons.\r\nThe same age events may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum of 4 fencers of each gender.\r\nY14 events will require foil masks with bibs and head-wires.\r\nWe will be testing weapons in Y14 events.\r\nY14 events will be CFF sanctioned, so CFF memberships will be required.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All Saints Elementary School Gymnasium","address":"1405 Como Lake

If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Friday before the Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in. Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in. Please bring your USFA card or proof of membership or be prepared to join at the competition. There will be no exceptions to this rule. Registration fee is $20 + $20 per event if done before the day of the event. PLEASE NOTE: Registration\/Registering at the door for this qualifier is $40 + $40 per event.

No charge cards accepted.\r\n\r\nIf you sign up for more than one event and they happen to actually be scheduled to fence then be prepared to fence both events at the same time if they overlap. If you are called to the strip and you do not arrive by the third call you will be scratched and there is no refund.\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA qualifying event so all fencing gear must conform to all USFA rules and regulations. Including the name on your leg or back and no holes in your uniform, mask, pants, and gloves. Under arm protectors are required by all and chest protectors also for all women.\r\n \r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095 You absolutely, positively must be a Nevada division member in order to compete in qualifying events. You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing). If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete. Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter. Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Nevada division's qualifiers. If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (director@redrockfencingcenter.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (702-222-1901). \r\n\r\nEntry\r\n\r\nAll events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event. Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Pacific Time) on the Saturday before the Sunday events. If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $20 and $20 per event. There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration and per event fee(s) or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations. All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change) or check.\r\nNo refunds! If you need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail by 11\/01 to receive credit towards a future event. \r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age. For the 2015-16 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2016, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event. Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1999-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event. After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1997-2003 and for the cadet events 2000-2003.\r\n\r\n\r\nFormat: One round of pools with 100% promotion to Direct Elimination.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event. \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in. If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in. Events generally start fencing about 10-20 minutes after close of registration.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

There are two ways to be sure you are affiliated with South Texas PRIOR to the qualifier:\r\n\r\n 1. Go to http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\/current-membership-listing and select the South Texas Division from the center dropdown menu at the bottom of the page. If your name appears, your affiliation SHOULD be correct.\r\n\r\n 2. Visit https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/Login.aspx?Redirect=Profile.aspx?returnurl=default.aspx and access your user profile. Verify that your division listing is correct. Take the time to verify your club information as well, since that club affiliation is what we are required to use to seed the events.\r\n\r\n If either or both of these methods do not show you affiliated with South Texas Division, but you feel you should attend our qualifiers, contact the National Office by phone or email to request your information be updated.\r\n\r\n Notes:\r\n Masks, body and mask cords, lames and saber manchettes\/gloves will be tested.\r\n\r\n Fencers may and are encouraged to fence in all events on a given day, but in order to keep the tournament on schedule, no three- or ten-minute rest will be given in one event for a bout just fenced in a different event.\r\n\r\n Events will be fenced as one round of pools (if there are at least four non-autoqualified fencers) with 100% promotion to DEs. If fewer than four non-auto-qualified fencers register for an individual event, the organizers reserve the option not to conduct any fencing for the event, and declare all fencers to have qualified. Would-be qualifiers must show up and pay their event fee in order to be considered qualified, even if no fencing is conducted.\r\n\r\n All participants must sign a Waiver of Liability. Anyone under age 18 must have a parent's or legal guardian's signature on this form (not a coach). The Waiver form will be available at the tournament or here: http:\/\/media.wix.com\/ugd\/7ff74c_e144125795a64b6fbaa79cfe1569de4c.pdf\r\n","venue":{"name":"Texas Fencing Academy","address":"8227 N.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels. Fencers will fence in Y10, Y12 or Y14 of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements.\r\n\r\nAll participants will earn a certain number of Points at each event throughout the series. The maximum number of points (MaximumPoints) is based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group      Max. Points\r\n\r\n  Y10 -\t\t     50\r\n  Y12 -\t\t    100\r\n  Y14 -\t\t    200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EventSizeRatio:\r\n  \r\nEventSizeRatio = NumberOfEntries \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event are calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NumberOfEntries \u0096 Place + 1) \/ NumberOfEntries) x MaximumPoints x EventSizeRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES:\r\n\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for the Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.
