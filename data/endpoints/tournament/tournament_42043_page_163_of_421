Circuit runs from Sept-May, 1 per month.\r\nOne point for each person that placed below you in a tournament. Only your top 7 tournament placings (out of a total of 9) will count to your final score. If you miss 2 tournaments, they won't count against you. If you make all 9, your lowest 2 scores will be dropped.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCornell Specific Info:\r\n\r\nPlease note that the venue will be different from last year. We will fence at the YMCA of Ithaca.\r\nGraham Road West, Ithaca NY 14850\r\n\r\nPlease print off and bring your USFA membership card, which can be printed from the USFA website. This will show your official USFA letter ranking and that you have valid membership on the day of the tournmanet. Receipts for membership do not show letters, so please click on the button that says print your membership card. Please add your membership number to your AskFred profile if you haven't already.\r\n\r\nCornell will be checking masks for safety and enforcing USFA rules including that you must wear an underarm protector, knickers, and socks that go to the knee. Weapons will be checked for weight resistance, shims, and screws, etc. \r\nPlease bring more than one weapon and body cord per fencer in case you have a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease bring proof of USFA Membership including your USFA membership number because we will not have internet access to verify from the USFA website.

If you do purchase 1-day membership, bring a printed receipt with the date of the tournament.

Any requests for refunds due to outstanding and unusual circumstances are at the discretion of the organizers and will be processed after the tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nTournament Organization\r\nAll events will be fenced electrically.\r\nMasks, body cords AND LAMES! will be subject to equipment control. Sabre cuffs are required. Seeding will be according to standard guidelines for ROC events. It is the responsibility of the fencer to notify the Bout Committee at the time of registration if they are on the NRPS. One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches. Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash.

Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiver of Liability\r\nThe Louisiana Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82491,"tournament_id":20012,"tournament":"FAP Unclassifed Sabre","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-10-28T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20041,"name":"Atlantic Fencing Academy - Div 2 Epee","start_date":"2012-10-28","end_date":"","comments":"USFA NJ Division sanctioned event for fencers with C, D, E or U classification.","prereg_open":"2012-09-17","prereg_close":"2012-10-27","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":10,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Atlantic Fencing Academy Div 2 Epee \r\nSunday, October 28. 2012\r\nVenue: Atlantic Fencing Academy\r\nOne Sheila Drive, Tinton Falls, NJ 07724\r\n\r\nSchedule:\r\n\r\nDiv 2 MIXED Epee --- Sunday   9 AM\r\n\r\n     [CANCELED: Div 2 Women's Epee 12 PM]\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.
