Should the tournament be cancelled, fees will be held as a credit for use in future Long Island Division qualifier events. \r\n\r\nVenue and Safety Protocols:\r\n- Only athletes, tournament staff, and coaches who hold a valid USFA Coach membership will be allowed to enter the fencing floor. Spectators must remain in designated spectator areas. (Carpeted areas or seating areas.) \r\n\r\n- Your USFA membership card (or digital membership card) will be required of all athletes and coaches in order to gain entry to the venue and fencing floor.\r\n\r\n- No personal chairs or alternative seating options are allowed on the floor. Fencers may bring a small tripod to record their bouts or stream to an outside party but placement of the tripod may not be in any place that will cause a safety concern or hinder the running of the event. These concerns will be determined by the referees, and final discretion lies with the Bout Committee. Tripods and phones\/cameras are at your own risk. The Division, venue, tournament, etc. will not be responsible for any broken equipment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCost Information:\r\nRegistration Fee = $10\r\nEvent Fee = $40 per event\r\n\r\nWalk-In Fees (After April 11th)\r\nRegistration Fee = $50\r\nEvent Fee = $120 per event\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an incomplete registrant on FRED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.

Below is a copy of that email.  Especially note:\r\n-No youth epee\r\n-All unrated, veteran and senior mixed competitors must have US Fencing membership of Access level or higher.\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to the 28th annual Middlebury Open!\r\n\r\nIf you are receiving this email, you are registered for the tournament this weekend.  Please read on for lots of important information about the tournament.\r\n\r\nIf you signed up and find you can not make it, please remove your name from the registration list so that we have an accurate idea of who to expect.  Two ways to withdraw:\r\n1. Log in to AskFRED.  Select \"My FRED\".  You will see a list of events you are registered for, with a red X next to each one.  Click the X to remove yourself from the event.\r\n2. If you are unable to access AskFRED, email me (vfox@gmavt.net@gmavt.net) and I will do it for you.\r\n\r\nIf you must withdraw on Saturday or Sunday due to illness (thank you for staying home if you are sick) or other reasons, please text me at 802-779-6530.   I will not be able to text you back but that's the best way to at least let us know not to expect you.\r\n\r\nThe Youth Epee event is cancelled due to not enough kids signing up.  \r\nOpen (senior mixed) Epee is currently full (cap of 56 fencers because that is all we have space in the gym for).  If you know you won't make it, please withdraw so that someone else can take your place.\r\n\r\nTournament location is Middlebury Union Middle School, 48 Deerfield Lane, Middlebury Vt..  You may pull into the bus circle to quickly unload, but then please move your car to the parking lot.  Please do not track water or mud onto the gym floor - remove wet shoes at the door.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule\r\nSaturday April 15 (Foil)\r\n8 a.m. Doors open, begin set up\r\n9:30 am Youth Foil, Veterans Foil\r\n11:30: Unrated Foil (separate male and female events if we have enough of both, otherwise a single mixed event)\r\n1:30 pm: Open Foil\r\n\r\nSunday April 16 (Epee and Saber)\r\n8:30 a.m Doors open (equipment will be left set up overnight)\r\n9:30 am Veterans Epee\r\n11:30: Unrated Epee (separate male and female events if we have enough of both, otherwise a single mixed event), Open Saber (note: you may not sign up for both Unrated Epee and Saber as they will be at the same time)\r\n1:30 pm: Open Epee\r\nEnd of open epee (best guess 6:30 pm): clean up\r\n\r\n\r\nFor all events except for Youth Foil, US Fencing membership at the Access or higher level is required.  This includes collegiate and Canadian fencers (Dartmouth club in particular-there are several of you without current memberships according to the US Fencing database).  If your membership is not current you must join or renew at usafencing.org before this weekend.  We can not do it for you at the tournament.\r\n\r\nPlease bring your membership card with you, or download it to your phone for display.  To print or download your card, log in to usfencing.org.   Please make sure your membership is up to date.  Not sure what kind of membership you have, or whether it is current?  Go to usafencing.org, click on \"membership\" and \"current member list\" and search for yourself.  It will show your membership type and expiration date (you may need to scroll sideways to see the expiration date).\r\n\r\nCanadian visitors: US Fencing requires you to have US Fencing membership to compete in US tournaments (I know, not fair, Canadian tournaments allow Americans to compete with no extra requirements).  The least expensive way to meet the requirement is to purchase an Access membership ($25) at usafencing.org.  If you join US Fencing for the first time after April 1, this membership will be good through all of next season.   Access membership is for participation in local (divisional) tournaments only - to compete in NACs or ROCs you will need a full competitive membership.   For entry fees, we accept Canadian cash at par if you bring exact change.   (For snacks, raffle tickets and t-shirts, we accept Canadian cash at the current exchange rate).\r\n\r\nFor this tournament, masks (the covid kind, not the fencing kind!) are optional.  While we are no longer checking vaccination cards, we expect all participants to be fully vaccinated for covid.   As always, err on the side of caution and do not come to the tournament if you are sick,  Wear a mask if you suspect you were recently exposed to covid from a close contact.  Please do your part to help the whole fencing community keep covid in check.\r\n\r\nEntry fees: $10 registation fee, plus $10 per event if registered by midnight April 10, with a $15 late fee if you signed up after that.  Please bring exact change, or check payable to VFA (no credit cards or phone payment apps).   When you arrive, go to the registration table to sign in, show your membership card and pay your entry fee.\r\n\r\nNew for this season!:  Fully certified refs who agree to ref within self-reffed events, allow us to list their names as official refs for the tournament, and serve on a bout committee if one is needed, get a $20 discount (ie. free entry into their first event of the tournament).   This is in addition to earning GMD coupons if you volunteer as a dedicated ref (not fencing yourself at the same time) for a complete U or youth event.\r\nFully certified means:\r\n-Referee rating of L2 or higher in one of the weapons you are fencing\r\n-Checked (Safesport training and background check) status if age 18+ - or Coach membership which includes the check\r\n-Signed the referee contract and marked \"Good to go\" in the US Fencing referee database\r\nIf you are a fully certified ref, please let us know when you check in at the registration table.\r\n\r\nIn recent years, gym rental costs have gone up.   Please don't be surprised that we are trying to pack maximum fencing action into mimimum gym rental time!   That means:\r\n-Doors open at 8 Saturday and 8:30 Sunday morning (please do not enter the school before that)\r\n-We need volunteers to arrive at 8 on Saturday and set up quickly, finishing up as veteran and youth foil events get underway.   We also need volunteers to stay until the end on Sunday and help clean up.  Everything can be left set up overnight on Saturday, so Sunday set up should be minimal.\r\n-Events will start as promptly as possible, and run on a fast track, double or triple stripping larger pools as much as possible.  Please arrive and check in at least 30 minutes before your posted event time.  We will not wait for late-comers.\r\n-You may not enter two events which start at the same time (i.e. open saber and unrated epee)\r\n-Stay alert and don't wander far from your strip, as you may be called upon to fence with little time between bouts\r\n\r\nThe format for all events will be one round of pools with 100% promoted to direct elimination.  We will make pools of 6-7 fencers whenever possible, but sometimes event numbers\/strip availability requires us to use pools of 5-9.   Youth and Veterans DE will consist of 10-touch bouts.  For all other events, the round of 64 (if there is one) will be 10 touch bouts, round of 32 tba depending on strip availability\/how it's going (10 or 15 touch), all remaining DEs (round of 16 on) will be 15 touch.   For the unrated events, if we have 6 or more of each gender, we will hold separate mens and womens events.  If fewer than 6 of either gender, a single mixed event will be held.\r\n\r\nOur venue is small (8 strips).  We are running a busy schedule of events, so there may not be much space for warming up.  Please be understanding, and share whatever space is available.  Everyone is in the same boat.   Please store your bags in the upper tiers of the bleachers, or in the adjacent hallways. \r\n\r\nThe Green Mt Division is friendly and welcoming.  We prize good sportsmanship and volunteer effort.  Play hard and compete with gusto, but don't forget to bring your sense of humor, patience, and a positive, helpful attitude.  We are especially appreciative of experienced fencers who help ref.  All open events will be self-reffed, so please help out if you have the skills to do so.\r\n\r\nThose who have been to the Middlebury Open before know that it's a festival of fencing, a fundraiser and a party all rolled into one.\r\n-Our talented in-house artist Adam Glazer has created yet another beautiful t-shirt design.   These are limited edition, available only at the tournament, when they're gone they're gone.  $15 each, in a range of adult sizes.\r\n-We will be holding a raffle, with many and varied wonderful prizes.  The drawing will be held on Sunday afternoon.  Winners need not be present, so are not there to collect your prize, we'll arrange to get it to you.   The more prizes, the more fun the raffle is, so if you have something you would like to donate, bring it along (just no white elephants, no alchohol and no stuff for small children please).  Tickets are $1 each or 6 for $5\r\n-Cafe VFA will be offering bagels and coffee, plus an array of snacks to keep you going throughout the day.  If you would like to donate some food to sell, that would be most welcome.\r\nPayment for all of these items is cash or check - no credit cards or phone apps.\r\n\r\nThis is the 7th tournament (of 9) of the 2022-23 Champlain Cup league (our first full season since 2018-19).

Should the tournament be cancelled, fees will be held as a credit for use in future Long Island Division qualifier events. \r\n\r\nVenue and Safety Protocols:\r\n- Only athletes, tournament staff, and coaches who hold a valid USFA Coach membership will be allowed to enter the fencing floor. Spectators must remain in designated spectator areas. (Carpeted areas or seating areas.) \r\n\r\n- Your USFA membership card (or digital membership card) will be required of all athletes and coaches in order to gain entry to the venue and fencing floor.\r\n\r\n- No personal chairs or alternative seating options are allowed on the floor. Fencers may bring a small tripod to record their bouts or stream to an outside party but placement of the tripod may not be in any place that will cause a safety concern or hinder the running of the event. These concerns will be determined by the referees, and final discretion lies with the Bout Committee. Tripods and phones\/cameras are at your own risk. The Division, venue, tournament, etc. will not be responsible for any broken equipment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCost Information:\r\nRegistration Fee = $10\r\nEvent Fee = $40 per event\r\n\r\nWalk-In Fees (After April 11th)\r\nRegistration Fee = $50\r\nEvent Fee = $120 per event\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an incomplete registrant on FRED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/ Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page here: https:\/\/cdn1.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7a08-2487836\/2022-23_Age_Classification_Eligibility_Chart_7.25.22.pdf#_ga=2.20290428.551257510.1678147371-628653051.1664233382\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies PRIOR to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date PRIOR to the event!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778. They can be contacted at 631-821-1131 for directions or assistance. A map can be found at http:\/\/bit.ly\/mfcmap Mission is in the same shopping center as Kohl's, Michael's, and PETCO.

Please call the club for more information.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nPlease note that event times listed are the close of registration. Fencers are required to be checked in by this time. Fencing will begin shortly after registration closes, usually within 30 minutes though the start may be immediate. It is recommended to leave yourself ample time for travel, check-in, and equipment check prior to the close of registration of your events.

For more information, see Table 2.6.3.1\"\r\n\r\n\"1.2 DIVISION AFFILIATION\r\nA member can declare a division affiliation based on their residence, location of the school that member is attending or location of the primary club that the member will represent in USA Fencing competitions. Each fencing season, a member must declare the division affiliation for that membership year. That division is the one from which the fencer must qualify to the USA Fencing National\r\nChampionships. The member may request a change in division if they move to a new geographic location (permanent residence or school) or select a primary club which is located in a different division, and notifies the National Office in writing of the new address and division change request.\" \r\n\r\n\"2.6 GENERAL QUALIFYING INFORMATION\r\n2.6.1 Division Qualifiers\r\nDivision qualifiers are competitions in which a specified number of fencers, based on their results, qualify to the USA Fencing National Championships and the Junior Olympic Championships.\r\nDivision qualifiers are restricted to members of the division for the following events: Y14, Div II and Div III (USA Fencing National Championships) and Cadet and Junior (JOs). Veteran fencers can qualify for USA Fencing National Championships via Division II or Division III division qualifiers. Division qualifying tournaments cannot be mixed gender competitions. Fencers who have earned national points are the only athletes who will be skipped over in the results to determine qualifying athletes. Athletes who have already qualified via a regional path will not be skipped over.\r\nFencers must be U.S. citizens or Permanent Res- idents. Athletes that have represented another country in the last three years at FIE level competitions (Veteran\/Senior\/Junior and those athletes that represented another country in the Cadet World Championships) are not eligible to compete in a National Championship, unless the athlete has been officially approved by the FIE to represent the USA. A foreign fencer who is in the United States on a visa is NOT eligible to fence in any National Championships, individual or team, or associated division qualifying competitions.``\r\n\r\nFull Athlete Packet can be found here: https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/athlete-handbook\r\n\r\nAs this is a qualifying event, we cannot estimate the number of fencers that will register at the door and therefore cannot estimate duration of events(s).\r\n\r\n\"2.6.4 Combined Division II\/Division III Divisional Qualifier Example\r\nBelow is an example of how to determine qualifiers for Division III when the division holds only one competition to determine qualifiers for both Divi- sion II and Division III.\r\nA Division II\/III qualifying competition has the following entries:\r\nNumber of C fencers = 8\r\nNumber of D fencers = 12\r\nNumber of E fencers = 11\r\nNumber of U fencers = 15\r\nTotal number of Fencers = 46\r\nTotal number of Division II qualifiers = 12 (based on 46 total C, D, E, and U fencers)\r\nTotal number of Division III qualifiers = 10 (based on 38 total D, E, and U fencers)\r\nHow to Determine Qualifiers:\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 List the fencers in order of their finish.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 The first 12 qualify for Division II and Division III if classification eligible at the start of the event.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Then count the number of D, E and U fencers. In this example, there are 38 such fencers. The 25% of that group equals 10, the number of fencers who can qualify for Division III Nationals only.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Starting with the first fencer after those qualified for Division II (in this example, 13th place); count off the next 10 D, E or U fencers who have not already qualified by other paths. These (10) D, E, or U fencers are qualified for Division III. Any C fencers in this range are skipped, but not counted against the 10, because they are not eligible to fence Division III.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Patten Gymnasium","address":"2407 Sheridan
