Competitors whose memberships are not verified during pre-registration will be asked to show a membership card or a current and valid receipt of membership to the registration committee. USFA membership forms will be available at the tournament. Fencers under 18 are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on the membership form. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA. Participants are required to fence in proper fencing attire; USFA rules will be applied. There are no alternate qualifiers to any National tournaments.\r\n\r\nWe will be testing masks, body cords, and lam\u00e9s.\r\n\r\nVETERANS with a \"C\" classification or lower fencing in the Division II\/III qualifier (or any veterans in the Section Division-IA Qualifier) are automatically qualified for that Veterans event at Summer Nationals.

Custom designed New Jersey Division, engraved medals will be awarded for 1st through 8th place for each event.\r\n\r\n<i>All fencers must wear full fencing attire, (that means sweat pants are not permitted, underarm protectors, plastrons for women, and long socks are required ), and bring at least two weapons and two body cords that meet USFA requirements.

Or, if the weather is agreeable and the fencer and family like to walk, take the PATH train to Pavonia Station, walk north on Washington which bends to the west and continue for two blocks to Grove Street.

If you are interested in competing in this tournament, you must meet all age and citizenship qualification requirements, as well as qualify through your Division if you are not an automatic qualifier.  This means that if more than 3 fencers from the Alabama Division are interested in qualifying to compete in the same event (e.g., Under 16 Women\u0092s Sabre) at Summer Nationals, then a qualifying competition must be held at the Division level.\r\n\r\nWe will be qualifying men and women for all 3 weapons in Under 16 and Youth 14 age groups, and for Div. II and Div. III events.\r\n\r\nWe will also qualify men\u0092s and women\u0092s Division I, Senior and Junior teams for each weapon.  If you are interested in team fencing, you will need to complete a team registration form to register for that event with your club name and the names of the team members and alternates.  \r\n\r\nFencers must be U.S. citizens or permanent residents of the United States.  On the USFA membership card, a foreign fencer is designated with an asterisk after their first name.  Fencers must have a USFA \u0093Competitive Member\u0094 card with an expiration date of July 31, 2007 or later.\r\n\r\nThe top 25% of the competitors at the qualifying tournament (no fewer than 3) will be eligible to compete in the Summer Nationals competition.  If it is necessary to hold a qualifying event for the Alabama Division, it will be held on Saturday, March 31, 2007.  The cost to register is $25.00 for the first individual event and $10.00 for each additional individual event and $25 for each team event.  The tournament will be held at Salle Bosco, 488 Dan Crutcher Road, Toney, Alabama 35773.  Directions to Salle Bosco can be found on the club website at http:\/\/www.sallebosco.com.\r\n\r\nComplete details concerning the qualification procedure and requirements for fencing at Summer Nationals are set forth in the 2006-2007 Athlete Handbook, the full text of which is available on the USFA website at www.usfencing.org.\r\n\r\nBill Becker (Chairman of the Southeast Section of the USFA and an FOC Certified Referee Instructor and a level 3 referee in all 3 weapons) has agreed to be the head referee and head of bout committee for our Alabama Division Summer Nationals Qualifier.  He will also offer a Referee Clinic at Salle Bosco on Sunday, April 1, 2007.\r\n\r\nYou must pre-register by Friday, March 23, 2007 in order to compete in this qualifying competition.  This deadline applies to both individual and team registrations.  Your entry form and payment must be received by the Alabama Division Secretary no later than Friday, March 23, 2007.  You may register on AskFred.net.  However, your registration on AskFred.net is not complete until you have mailed your entry form and payment to Carol Gray Caldwell, Alabama Division Secretary, 985 Valley View Road, Indian Springs, Alabama 35124, and you have received an email confirmation of receipt of that entry form and payment.  Only then will your pre-registration appear on the listing of registrants for the tournament on AskFred.net.  If your name does not appear on the listing of registrants for the tournament on AskFred.net, then your entry form and payment have not been received and you are NOT registered for the qualifying tournament.   If you do not contact me before the March 23, 2007 deadline and make arrangements to get your entry form and payment to me no later than midnight on March 23, 2007, there is nothing I can do to register you for the qualifying tournament after that time.  The deadline will be strictly enforced.  Anyone checking AskFred.net at midnight on March 23, 2007 will see the complete listing of all fencers who are registered for each event.  If you have any questions or any problems registering on AskFred.net, please contact Carol Gray Caldwell at 205-988-0947 before the March 23, 2007 deadline.\r\n\r\nYou will be notified by email, at the email address you have listed for your account on AskFred.net, on March 25, 2007, of the times for each event for this tournament, and of any events which will not be held due to the small number of fencers registered for that event.  In general, it is anticipated that Youth 14 and Under 16 events will be scheduled in the morning and Div. II and Div. III events will be scheduled in the afternoon.  The Div. II and Div. III events may be fenced as combined events for some or all weapons.\r\n\r\nYou must be a competitive member of the Alabama Division of the USFA to fence in this tournament.  Membership forms are available on the USFA website at www.usfencing.org.  You may also apply for membership at the registration desk at the tournament.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please contact me at CGCwell@aol.com or at 205-988-0947.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nCarol Gray Caldwell\r\nAlabama Division Secretary\r\n\r\n \r\n....................................................\r\nALABAMA DIVISION\r\nSUMMER NATIONALS QUALIFIER\r\nMARCH 31, 2007\r\n\r\nName:____________________________________Club:______________\r\nAddress:__________________________________Division:_________\r\nCity:_____________________ State:______ Zip:_______  \/  \/Male    \/  \/ Female\r\nBirth Date:_____\/ ________\/________USFA Number:____________________\r\nEmail address to contact:____________________________________________\r\n\r\nFees ($25 for the first event; $10 for each additional event):\r\n\t\r\nYouth 14* Men\u0092s Epee $_____\t\t\t\t\t\r\nUnder 16** Men\u0092s Epee $_____\t\t\t\t\t\r\nDiv.

Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers (total for combined event).
