Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"195 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661499,"longitude":-73.9794226,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":84693,"tournament_id":20569,"tournament":"NYAC Fortuna Cup (Women's Epee)","full_name":"BAbove Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"B+SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-02-24T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":21337,"name":"NorCal Div II\/III\/Vet Summer Nationals Qualifier","start_date":"2013-02-24","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2013-01-29","prereg_close":"2013-02-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Pre-registration cut-off on AskFred.net : Monday of the week of the tournament.\r\n\r\nFees:\t$30 if pre-registered, $40 at door\r\n\r\nDiv2\/Div3 event will be combined in one tournament this season.\r\n\r\nOnly US Citizens and Permanent US Residents (Green Card) can compete in the qualifiers.

If you are not sure if you can make it, just pre-register without pre-pay.  You can always go back into your AskFred Account and pre-pay up until the cut-off date.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":86192,"tournament_id":20987,"tournament":"FAP Div3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-02-24T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20988,"name":"BCAF-WEST M\/W Senior Epee Open","start_date":"2013-02-24","end_date":"","comments":"This is a Philadelphia Div. event.

Restaurants and micro-breweries are varied and plentiful. The Hilton Gardens is a brief RTD light rail trip to, and the downtown Courtyard Marriott and Embassy Suites are within easy walking distance of, the Denver Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, the Pepsi Center, Coors Field, the newly opened History Colorado Center, and the Denver Art Museum. In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly.

You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1998-2001\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19703\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/01\/2013\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
