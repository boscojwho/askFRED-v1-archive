If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2021-2022 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers (28 men and 14 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door. Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

age of 81. He was born in Grand Forks, ND on August 2, 1930. Selberg received his Maitre D'Armes from the Federation International D'Escrime in 1967. In addition to being a fencing master, Selberg was also an abstract, post-impressionist painter. He has a painting in the permanent collection at Minnesota State University Moorhead in Moorhead, MN, and also one at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. On the side of the McCormick building in downtown Fargo, ND is a restored version of his infamous sign painting of 'The Cowboy' that he originally painted in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey). Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas. A sign painter, cartoonist and an artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952, where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine of Arts degrees from San Francisco State University. Selberg taught art in San Francisco and fell in love with fencing in the early 1950's. Fencing first took root in North Dakota in 1960, when Charles moved from San Francisco, where he was the head coach at the San Francisco School of Fencing (run by John McDougall), back to Fargo, ND, where he then founded North Dakota's first fencing school, the Selberg Fencing Academy, which he operated there between 1960 and 1966. The Selberg Fencing Academy (SFA) was originally located at 54 1\/2 North 5th St. in Fargo, but was moved in 1965 to the Fargo Arena building in Island Park in Fargo. Selberg thought that fencing would do well in Fargo because of the long cold winters that forced many people there indoors for physical activity. Fencing competitions in Fargo during that time (including many dual matches between Minneapolis and Fargo) were held either at the SFA or at Moorhead State University (MSU), in MSU's large gym. Between 1960 and 1966, the North Dakota division grew to become the 4th-largest fencing division in the country, and SFA fencers won three Midwest Championships, a Chicagoland Open Championship, and finished in the Top 10 at the U.S. National Championships in Women's Foil two years in a row. In 1966, Selberg returned to San Francisco and taught fencing at the famous Halberstadt Fencer's Club, and also began his 16-year career teaching fencing at the University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College). Known affectionately as Mr. Natural among fencers at the University of California at Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, Maestro Selberg was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, his creative abilities, and his tremendous sense of humor. The fencing masters that taught Charles formed his impressive fencing lineage: German-born Eric Funke, American-born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian-born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on Charles' teaching. In 1970, Selberg was a member of the only U.S. foil team to ever win a gold medal at the World Masters Championships. Named one of the 'Great Fencing Masters in History', Charles was the author of the renowned books 'Foil' (1976) and 'Revised Foil' (1993). After retiring from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1982, Selberg moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the Selberg Fencing Academy and created an extensive series of instructional fencing videos and DVDs (http:\/\/www.selbergfencing.com). Master Selberg taught that the greatest benefits that we get from fencing are health and recreation.","venue":{"name":"Southwest Youth Arena","address":"4404 23rd Avenue S","city":"Fargo","state":"ND","zip":"58103","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":46.8431526,"longitude":-96.8585543,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":35,"name":"Minnesota","abbrev":"MN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":197971,"tournament_id":50898,"tournament":"2022 Charles Selberg Memorial Open","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-08-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50841,"name":"CFC Summer Youth Saber\/Epee Battle","start_date":"2022-08-14","end_date":"","comments":"Come compete in the Summer Youth Battle!

He continued to compete in epee while studying in Brussels, finishing 10th in the Belgian Nationals in 1973. He was assistant coach at Lakeland HS in 1988-89. He also ran Fair Lawn's fencing program as head coach for 20 years, retiring in 2016. He has also served as the President of the HS Coaches Association (NJIFA) from 2012-2016. He volunteered his time as a member of the NJ Division's Executive Committee, and also the Tournament Committee. Fencers always saw him at competitions as a referee and\/or armorer all over New Jersey, NY, and New England. He was one of the pioneers of r promoting our sport in high schools throughout the area. In September 2018, Dr. Packer passed away sadly. We will continue to run this tournament in his memory every year to show our appreciation for his hardwork and dedication.\r\n\r\nFee:\r\n$45 for Freehold Fencing members\r\n$50 if preregistered and pay at the door\r\n$65 for WALK-INS\r\n\r\nAll payments made at the door and must be in cash or check only.\r\n**CREDIT CARDS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED FOR PAYMENTS AT THE DOOR*****\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\nFreehold Fencing Academy is located at:\r\nPoet's Square Mall\r\n56 Thoreau Drive\r\nKozloski Road\r\nFreehold, NJ 07728\r\nTel.: 732-610-0322\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT RENTAL FEES\r\n$10 -

Mahvash won gold at the 1973 Asian Games in Tehran at the age of 17! This performance set her up to push for an Olympic qualification, and she did so. After a gold medal in the Asian Olympics in Foil with the Iranian team, Mahvash fenced in the 1976 Olympic Games in Montreal, Canada. After the Olympics, she moved to the United States and studied Electrical Engineering at the University of Southern California. While at USC, Mahvash continued to fence and competed in the 1977 NCAA Championships. She was named MVP of the 1977 season by USC. \r\n\r\nAll fencers must wear required fencing attire and bring at least 2 working weapons and 2 working body cords.\r\n\r\nValid USFA membership is required.
