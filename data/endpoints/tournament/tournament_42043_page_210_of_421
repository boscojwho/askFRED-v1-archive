Event time(s) for events that will be fenced are noted with event registrations and below.\r\n\r\nBe advised, USFA rules allow qualification for VET events at Summer Nationals via division qualification. Qualification occurs by \"competing\" in a DIV II\/DIV III event for the weapon you would be interested in fencing for VET's at Summer Nationals. Qualification is limited to DIV II\/DIV III eligible fencers rated C and Below. Qualification for VET events is not dependent on your placement in the DIV II\/III qualifier (and is therefore automatic based solely on participation). However, any placement within the top 25% would additionally qualify you to compete in a DIV II\/DIV III event as allowed by your placement and classification. Therefore, a separate VET qualifier is not necessary, and will not be fenced. \r\n\r\nPlease see the USFA Athlete Handbook for qualification paths and requirements.  \r\n\r\nThere is NO walk-in registration for this tournament. USFA and Indiana Division membership required.\r\n \r\nEvents will be fenced ONLY if there are more than three competitors. The direct elimination round will be fenced to determine each place (no tie for third). If three or less fencers register for the event, those eligible fencers will be considered qualified. \r\n\r\nRegistration for this event will close on Wednesday, April 2nd.  \r\n\r\nRegistration Fees: $20 per event.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled (check-in time TBD):\r\nWomen's DIV II\/III Epee - Event will Not be Fenced  \r\nWomen's DIV II\/III Foil - Event will Not be Fenced\r\nWomen's DIV II\/III Saber - Event will Not be Fenced\r\nMen's DIV II\/III Epee - Check in at 2P\r\nMen's DIV II\/III Foil - Check in at 330P\r\nMen's DIV II\/III Saber - Event will Not be Fenced\r\nY14 Women's Epee - Event Will Not be Fenced\r\nY14 Women's Foil - Event Will Not be Fenced\r\nY14 Women's Saber - Event Will Not be Fenced\r\nY14 Men's Epee - Event Will Not be Fenced\r\nY14 Men's Foil - Event Will Not be Fenced\r\nY14 Men's Saber - Event Will Not be Fenced\r\n\r\nTimes for events that will be fenced are noted above.

There will be foil events for all Youth age groups, plus Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\nNew addition: a Y14 Novice event for fencers who have never fenced a tournament before.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #5\r\nDate(s): 04\/05\/2014\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, April 5th, 2014\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y8, Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y14 Epee, Y14 Novice Foil\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $10 (plus tax) per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2013-2014 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 Novice event is for fencers who have never fenced a tournament before. Fencers will need to upgrade their USA Fencing membership to the Competitive version. The renewal will last through the end of next season (July 2015).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: Y8 and Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touches, 2 periods of 3 minutes each. The first period ends when 3 minutes have elapsed or one fencer scores 5 touches, whichever comes first. Y12 direct elimination bouts are now 15 touches, 3 periods of 3 minutes each -- just like Y14 and senior DE bouts.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2003-2006\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1999-2002\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=24604\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/14\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

The Summer National Championships are held this year the last week of June. \r\n\r\nDoors open at 8:00 AM and registration and equipment check opens at 8:30 AM.   Times listed are \"close of registration.\" That being said, we encourage everyone (especially beginners to the sport) to be at the venue AT LEAST one half hour before the CLOSE of your event, to make sure you can sign in and get your equipment checked and approved BEFORE the close of registration for your event. \r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2013-2014) members of the USFA and must be members of the Oregon Division; fencers from other divisions are not eligible to compete. Y14 fencers must fall in that age bracket OR the athlete must be on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket.\r\n\r\nPermanent residents who have not represented another country in the last three years may participate. If you are auto-qualified for the SN, you are still encouraged to fence! (Fees waived for you, please still register on AskFred by deadline.)\r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD! All fencers must be current USFA members and be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership.  Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nIn each event, the top 25% (rounded up) who were not previously qualified (i.e. through a ROC) will qualify for SNQ, with a minimum of 3. If 3 or fewer fencers show up for an event, the event will not need to be fenced for qualification purposes (it can be fenced for the sake of awarding medals.)  Fencers that earn qualification at the DIV II events will automatically for the corresponding DIV III events event (if rating-eligible.)\r\n\r\nPre-registration on FRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Friday night, March 28, 2014. Also, at this point, we only accept cash or checks at Division events - NO credit\/debit cards. Please make checks out to the Oregon Division\/USFA. \r\nFees: Discounted registration fees are $15 per fencer, plus $10 per event (i.e., a total of $25 for one event) for those that preregister on AskFred by the deadline. After this time, fencers are welcome with late fees, if board notified prior to midnight of 3\/28. \r\n\r\nIf you want to both register for the tournament and the event in the week following the deadline, triple reg fees ($45) and double event fees ($20) will apply. If you are pre-registered on time but want to add another event after the pre-reg deadline, double event fees for that event will apply (i.e. $20 per event.)  Walk-ins the weekend of the event (i.e. 4\/5\/14): $90 registration and $60 per event. Save yourself money and pre-register in time. \r\n\r\nIf you are auto-qualified for your desired event at the SNQs (i.e. Div 2 men\u0092s foil), you are still encouraged to fence! (Fees waived for you for that event, but please still preregister on Askfred by the deadline. Please consult with bout committee at check-in to see if your presence will be needed.) Registration fees are non-refundable, but the per-event fees will not be charged if an event is not fenced.\r\n\r\nFull USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. Foil events require conductive foil masks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. \r\n\r\nTo facilitate the equipment check, we anticipate that division volunteers will be present the evening of April 4 at the NWFC to check the equipment of fencers who are competing Saturday. If you are fencing Sunday, please come by on Saturday to get your stuff checked and approved, and help us reduce lines the day of your event. Thanks! \r\n\r\nHere are additional important notes:\r\nHealthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area. \r\n\r\nOur qualifier is entirely staffed (with the exception of the referees) by volunteers, without whom this event would not take place. Please email nwhitson(at)gmail.com if you can help fill a shift or two. \r\n\r\nThe sport of fencing could not exist without our referees, whose role it is, is make sure that everyone is having fun (by fencing) and ensuring safety. With this and every division-sanctioned event, we expect the following from all participants (which includes all athletes, spectators, and coaches):\r\n\r\n\u0095\tRespect of the referees and non-interference during bouts.\r\n\u0095\tDirect your questions and complaints only to the head referee, not the referee on the strip.\r\n\u0095\tReplays on your Ipad are not legal and won't change the referee's call.\r\n\u0095\tSpectators are welcome to train and become referees themselves if they think they can do better. The Oregon Division will be hosting another referee seminar on Saturday May 24 and May 25 for the accompanying tournament.\r\n\u0095\t\u0093Disturbing order\u0094 from the sidelines is against the rules and could get you a warning (yellow card) or ejected (black card). ANY referee or head referee can card ANYBODY in the gym. But we don\u0092t want that, so please show good sportsmanship. \r\n\r\nAs a last note, in 2013, the USFA Board of Directors adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines new requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. \r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\nTournament: Oregon Division Summer National Qualifiers\r\nDate(s): 04\/05\/2014 - 04\/06\/2014\r\nLocation: NorthWest Fencing Center\r\nFor directions, visit http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=25707\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/28\/2014\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

This tournament is for fencers who are new to competition. Please do not register if you have been to more than 10 tournaments. An experienced fencer's victory over a bunch of beginners isn't really much of a victory.\r\n\r\nThe Scrimmage Series was designed to give fencers an opportunity to fence with friendly adversaries outside of regular group classes, to experience different fencing styles, and to try new moves and techniques. This series will help students gain valuable tournament experience and prepare them for bigger events.\r\n\r\nNO RATINGS CAN BE AWARDED AT UNSANCTIONED EVENTS. No ratings will be earned at this event. AskFRED will automatically calculate the potential rating of each event based on preregistration. Disregard this information. No ratings can be earned or awarded for competition at unsanctioned, non-USFA events.\r\n\r\nFencers at this unsanctioned series will earn points based on the results at each event. At the third and final tournament, awards will be given to fencers with the most points. This series emphasizes sportsmanship and friendly competition for newer fencers!\r\n\r\nThe top 4 places will be awarded with medals.\r\n\r\nThis non-USFA tournament will be governed by USFA rules. All fencers must wear thick socks to the knee, knickers (fencing pants), a plastron, chest protection (women), a jacket, a lame (foil\/sabre), a mask (electric for sabre\/foil) and a glove (electric glove or cuff for sabre). Bring 2 electric weapons and 2 body cords. The $5 Non-Competitive Membership to the USFA is required. You may sign up directly with USFencing.org at the tournament for this membership.\r\n\r\nEvent times and formats may change based on pre-registration, so be sure to check your email and this page a few days before the event.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION fee- $30 at the door If pre register (cash or check) NO CREDIT CARDS WILL BE ACCEPTED!\r\nWalk in is $40:00\r\nAdditional event $10 extra. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/02\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/05\/2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Freehold Fencing Academy","address":"56 Thoreau Drive","city":"Freehold","state":"NJ","zip":"07728","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2546707,"longitude":-74.2456797,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":102092,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-06T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":102093,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-05T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":102094,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-06T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":102095,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-05T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":102099,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":9,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-05T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":102100,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":15,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-06T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":102101,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":9,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-05T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":103349,"tournament_id":25515,"tournament":"Scrimmage Series #2 @ Freehold Fencing","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-04-06T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":25518,"name":"Inland Empire Division Tournament","start_date":"2014-04-05","end_date":"","comments":"This is our Division Qualifier for DIV II\/III & Y14 for Summer Nationals in Columbus, Ohio.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $50.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made.

Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b><i>Eligibility Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be <b>current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.<\/b> To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA.

Only fencers with a rating of C or lower are eligible to fence at these qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies <b>prior<\/b> to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Uniform Requirements:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.

There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions.  These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March and\/or July NACs.   Y14 winners qualify for Y14 at SN.    Y8 is not an official USA Fencing category.   RYC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE license.   \r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nQualification Path for Y10\/Y12 to the March and July NACs:\r\nFencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the March and July NACs.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nQualification Path to Nationals for Y14 from RYC: \r\nPlace first in the Y14 event at a current-season RYC tournament [BoD, October 2010] In mixed events, only the first place finisher is recognized as qualified.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRegional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be used for RYC events.   No regional points are awarded in Y8 age category.   End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region.    Regional point standings can be found at:  (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698463-roc-and-ryc-rankings).    Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS.  Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List.   Each participant is awarded Region 3 points at this RYC.  The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in.  If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count  towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking.    RYC tournaments will award points to all participants.  Point allocations depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement.   At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.   These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS. \r\n<b>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Cobra Youth Tournament Series<\/b>.

We encourage you to pre-register.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a qualifier, it is open ONLY to members of the Metropolitan Division.  If USA Fencing lists you under New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester, Alaska, or any other division you won't be able to fence in this event.\r\n \r\nYou must belong to USA Fencing with proof of membership in order to compete.  Join or renew at http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership.  If you need to join USA Fencing on-site, you will need a separate check or credit card # for their form. \r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y14 points will be allowed to fence Cadets.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Metropolitan Division sanctioned event. Ratings will be awarded where earned.\r\n\r\nPlease bring a check or cash if you don't prepay using AskFred; no credit cards accepted at the door for entry fees.\r\n\r\nNo refunds! If you need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail (info@brooklynfencing.com) by Friday, 4\/4, to receive a credit for a future event.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetition Format\r\nOne round of

If you\u0092re not a member yet check out http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership (make sure you have pop-ups enabled) You can also re-print your credentials if needed. \r\n\r\n- If there is insufficient attendance to hold 1 or more events in a given weapon, the events may be combined into a mixed event. \r\n\r\n- Pre-registering helps everyone! You save money! More people will come if they see more people signed up. We can run a better tournament by hiring the proper amount of directors, and having adequate number of strips set up.
