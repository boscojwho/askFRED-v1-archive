If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/25\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30767,"tournament_id":6879,"tournament":"Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7910,"name":"Alliance Four Seasons Cup, Spring 2009","start_date":"2009-03-01","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2009-02-02","prereg_close":"2009-02-28","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Alliance Four Seasons Cup, Spring 2009 tournament is the third out of the four Cup tournaments that run during the 2008-09 season.\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA sanctioned event.\r\nRatings will be awarded according to the USFA classification chart.\r\n\r\nSignature Alliance Cup medals for the top 4 fencers.\r\nSignature Alliance Cup trophy for the best points standing fencer after 4 tournaments.\r\n     \r\nTournament to be held at Alliance Fencing Academy\/Houston (see the map above).\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSunday, March 1, 2009\r\n10:00AM: Open Mixed Epee\r\n\r\nTournament Fee: $25\r\n\r\nCall 713-301-7934 for traffic\/weather delays.\r\n\r\nUSFA membership required. \r\n\r\nWAIVER REQUIRED: Please pre-print and bring waiver to event.

Fencers may enter only one age group event.\r\n\r\nIf in the Senior Mixed E and Under event there are less than 15 total fencers, but at least 6 men and 6 women present, the genders may be split into two separate events, depending upon the circumstances.\r\n\r\n<b>BIRTH YEAR LIMITATIONS (2009-2010 season)<\/b>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Senior event: 1995 or before\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Youth 12 event 1996-1999, or on Youth 10 NRP List\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2Youth 10 event 1998-2001\r\n\r\n<b>ENTRY FEES<\/b>\r\nAdvance Registration (by 3\/5\/2009): $25\r\nAt the Door: $40\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT ORGANIZATION<\/b>\r\nAll events will be fenced electrically.

One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches (2 out of 3 five touch bouts for Y10 & Y12). Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. \r\n\r\n<b> USFA MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED<\/b>\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. Proof of membership is required.  Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using  most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\n<b>WAIVER OF LIABILITY<\/b>\r\nThe North Texas Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Foil \r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/06\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35932,"tournament_id":8060,"tournament":"\"D\" Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":26,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-08T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6532,"name":"Senior Team National Qualifier","start_date":"2009-03-08","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2008-08-24","prereg_close":"2009-03-07","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Salle Palasz","address":"201 Homeland Avenue","city":"Baltimore","state":"MD","zip":"21212","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.353495,"longitude":-76.618743,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":29506,"tournament_id":6532,"tournament":"Senior Team National Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Men's Team Foil","short_name":"SrMFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-08T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29507,"tournament_id":6532,"tournament":"Senior Team National Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Men's Team Saber","short_name":"SrMSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-08T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29508,"tournament_id":6532,"tournament":"Senior Team National Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Women's Team Saber","short_name":"SrWSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-08T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7300,"name":"Great Moose D & Under","start_date":"2009-03-08","end_date":"","comments":"Pre-registration $15\/ event; On site $20\/event","prereg_open":"2008-11-10","prereg_close":"2009-03-04","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is a D & Under Tournament. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nEpee at 9 am\r\nSaber at 12:30 pm\r\nFoil at 3 pm\r\n\r\nMen and women's events will be fenced separately.

Tournament cost is 10.00. \r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door.*\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Senior Circuit #4 and will be based on points earned in Senior Circuits #1-4.  This first series will be entirely foil.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Senior Circuit #8 and will be based on Senior Circuits #5-8. The second series will be exclusively epee.  Trophies will be awarded to the top 3 points earners in each series, respectively.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1)  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of participants equals the number of points.  So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points.  The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age by January 1st of the 2008-09 season or higher are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.  Trophies will be given out at the last tournament of each series.  If fencers, for whatever reason, cannot attend, prizes will be held for them at the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/01\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/11\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 S.W Western Ave","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35100,"tournament_id":7906,"tournament":"Senior Circuit #6","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":17,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-03-12T19:15:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6465,"name":"NJFA Friday Night Unrated Mens Foil ","start_date":"2009-03-13","end_date":"","comments":"Fri Nite Unrated Men's Foil.

The CFF Competition Rules allow for up to 5 individuals of the opposite gender to the competition to be mixed in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the event will still be ranked as a single event.

Your BCFA membership must be in good standing in order to participate in the tournament.  Memberships cannot be purchased at the tournament \u00e2\u0080\u0093 please purchase your passport ahead of time or we may not be able to validate it on the day of the tournament.  This is because the CFF will fine tournament organizers $25 per competitor (payable prior to ranking) for those who do not meet licence requirements.  We will have the right to refuse you if you do not have a validated CFF licence prior to the tournament.  If you wish to purchase a CFF licence and a BCFA membership, please visit these websites ahead of time and make the necessary payments: \r\nhttp:\/\/www.fencing.ca\/cff_licences\/licence_purchase_filter_new.htm\r\nhttp:\/\/www.fencing.bc.ca \r\n\r\nPre-registration closes on Thursday, March 12, 2009.

We will, however, accept cash in US funds at par at the registration table.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- WAIVERS: ----------\r\n\r\nThe Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.  Waiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament; however, you are welcome to complete the form ahead of time and hand that in at the time of registration.  Fencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form and hand that in at the time of registration.  If you wish to obtain a copy of the waiver form, please contact us by email.  Thank you for your cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- PRIZES: ----------\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to the top four fencers of each event.  \r\n\r\n\r\n---------- DIRECTIONS: ----------\r\n\r\nHere is a link showing the location of the Student Union Building in UBC: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/index_detail.php?locat1=790&show=y,n,n,n,n,y\r\n\r\nHere is a map of the UBC campus: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/images\/pdf\/ubcmap.pdf\r\n\r\nHere is a Google map of the campus: http:\/\/maps.google.ca\/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6138+Student+Union+Boulevard,+Vancouver,+BC&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=27.881336,81.738281&ie=UTF8&ll=49.268379,-123.250186&spn=0.006875,0.019956&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=0\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] on the map.\r\n\r\nThere is a parkade north of the SUB called \u00e2\u0080\u009cNorth Parkade\u00e2\u0080\u009d you can park in. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building between the Student Recreation Centre (SRC) and the War Memorial Gym. \r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry or the border after Oak St Bridge:\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive, or\r\nOption B: follow Oak Street all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Avenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is the first and only exit on the right close to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights \u00e2\u0080\u0093 do not run the red lights, okay?\r\n\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it is a bit far away from the SUB.  IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $4.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS: ----------\r\n\r\nAccommodations at the University of British Columbia are available for those who wish to stay on campus for the tournament.
