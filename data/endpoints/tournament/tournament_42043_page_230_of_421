Because of the delay in posting, no late fee will be assessed at the door, but it really does help if you preregister.  We check data ahead of time for each tournament; adding fencers on the spot is much slower than removing absent fencers.\r\n\r\nEligibility Restrictions:\r\nASKFRED is enforcing gender, age, and division membership restrictions. \r\n\r\nEverything you need to know, especially age eligibility for this competition and for the Junior Olympics 2014 event can be found at usfencing.org.\r\n\r\nDivision membership is based on your official, declared USFA membership affiliation.  There are two ways to be sure you are affiliated with South Texas PRIOR to the qualifier:\r\n\r\n1.  Go to http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\/current-membership-listing and select the South Texas Division from the center dropdown menu at the bottom of the page.  If your name appears, your affiliation SHOULD be correct.\r\n\r\n2.  Visit https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/Login.aspx?Redirect=Profile.aspx?returnurl=default.aspx and access your user profile.  Verify that your division listing is correct.  Take the time to verify your club information as well, since that club affiliation is what we are required to use to seed the events.\r\n\r\nIf either or both of these methods do not show you affiliated with South Texas Division, but you feel you should attend our qualifiers, contact the National Office by phone or email to request your information be updated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMasks, body and mask cords, lames and saber manchettes\/gloves will be tested.\r\n\r\nFencers may and are encouraged to fence in all events on a given day, but in order to keep the tournament on schedule, no three- or ten-minute rest will be given in one event for a bout just fenced in a different event.\r\n\r\nEvents will be fenced as one round of pools (if there are at least four non-autoqualified fencers) with 100% promotion to DEs. If fewer than four non-auto-qualified fencers register for an individual event, the organizers reserve the option not to conduct any fencing for the event, and declare all fencers to have qualified.  Would-be qualifiers must show up and pay their event fee in order to be considered qualified, even if no fencing is conducted.\r\n\r\nAll participants must sign a Waiver of Liability. Anyone under age 18 must have a parent's or legal guardian's signature on this form (not a coach).","venue":{"name":"Jowers Gymnasium","address":"700 Aquarena Springs Drive","city":"San

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot behind building, enter from Glenside Avenue. We are Suite 201, Building C.  Bring food and drink, their are changing rooms but no showers.  The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-NORTH","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108122,"tournament_id":27336,"tournament":"FAP-North E Sabre & E Epee","full_name":"EUnder Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"E-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-12-20T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27599,"name":"PDX Saber Progressive #4","start_date":"2014-12-20","end_date":"","comments":"Fourth(of eight) of the 2014-15  In House (CLUB MEMBERS only or by invite) Progressive series.

Medals for the top 4 in each tournament will be awarded.\r\n\r\nTrophies will be awarded as follows:\r\nFor the \"best 4 of 6\"\r\n\r\nTop Senior Male\r\nTop Senior Female\r\nTop Vet (40+)\r\n\r\nAlso for those who have fenced four out of six, there will be a prize for the most improved rating by number of places. For example, a \"U\" to a \"D\" would be two places as would a \"C\" to an \"A\". If two fencers advance the same number of places the award will be settled by either pistols at dawn or rock-paper-scissors. More than that there will be a drawing.\r\n\r\nThose who fence in all six tournaments will be entered in a drawing for yet another prize.\r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention T-Shirts?!

Barb started fencing at Morris Hills High School (NJ) and continued as a college club fencer at Purdue University. She served as the NJ division chair for over 10 years, coached Morris Hills High school for 21 years, served as USFA bout committee chair for many, many national fencing tournaments and Junior Olympic Championships, served as USFA Vice President from 2000-2004, and was honored with a lifetime membership to the USFA. This RYC honors her work on behalf of young fencers.\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nTournament information communications: Important tournament information will be communicated through the FRED e-mail system. Be sure your e-mail address is up-to-date. Visit askfred.net then go to \"My FRED\" to verify your current e-mail address. \r\n\r\nFollow live results at: http:\/\/www.cobrafencing.com\/results\r\n\r\n==================================================================================================================================================================\r\n\r\nThe RYC (Regional Youth Circuit) tournaments are held throughout the season, similar to the Super Youth Circuit tournaments. There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at either a NAC or SN and Youth 14 at SN. RYC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE license.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10\/12\/14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament requirements.\r\n\r\nSummer National Championships: Beginning this season, the Y10 and Y12 events at Summer Nationals will be designated as National Championship Events. Qualification paths for Y10\/12\/14 are maintained in the Athletes Handbook (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 winner of an RYC event NO LONGER earns automatic qualification to the Summer National Championships.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRegional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be awarded for RYC events. End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region. Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS. Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List. Each participant gets Region 3 points at this RYC. The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. RYC tournaments will award points to all participants. See the regional guidelines for point allocations at (http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6318\/Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative__1_.pdf). Allocations depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS nor the event seeding. \r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCobra Youth Tournament Series. This is an event in Cobra's series of youth tournaments throughout the season, providing an atmosphere designed to help you become a better competitor, promote positive competition, sportsmanship, and love of fencing. All fencers will earn series points (inversely based on size of event) and winners (top 3 in each age\/weapon) will be recognized at the end of the season.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION AND EVENT FEES \r\nIf you wish to just make a donation but are not planning to fence, after entering and making your payment please remove your entry (or notify us).

First events of the day may start sooner.\r\n\r\nDoors open about 45 minutes before the close of registration for the first event.\r\n\r\nFencers planning to fence two age groups are advised there will be some overlap between events (for example, you may have to fence some Y12 DE bouts during your Y14 pool if you're doing well in the Y12s). Directors are used to this and will not scratch your bouts if you're fencing in the other event; however, fencing in two events is your choice - please be ready to fence a few bouts in a row if need be to keep your events moving.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry & Eligibility\r\n$40 pre-registered on AskFred \/ $60 walk-ins at the door.  We encourage you to pre-register.\r\n \r\nYou must belong to USA Fencing or another FIE federation with proof of membership in order to compete.

(For instance, a fencer with Y12 points will be allowed to fence Y14.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Metropolitan Division sanctioned event. Ratings will be awarded where earned.  However, note that for youth events, a C or higher event rating is necessary for classifications to be earned.\r\n\r\nPlease bring a check or cash if you don't prepay using AskFred; no credit cards accepted at the door for entry fees.\r\n\r\nNo refunds!

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot behind building, enter from Glenside Avenue. We are Suite 201, Building C.  Bring food and drink, there are changing rooms but no showers.  The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108125,"tournament_id":27339,"tournament":"FAP-North Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-12-21T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27866,"name":"Fencers Club Senior Men's Epee Open","start_date":"2014-12-21","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for a Senior Men's Epee Open. $40 if pre-registered via AskFRED or $50 at the door.

Matches can be in any weapon that both fencers are cleared to bout in (dry foil, electrical foil, dry sabre, electrical saber, electrical epee - sorry, no dry epee). AFL rules will be used for dry bouts, and USFA rules will be used for electrical bouts. In case of a disagreement over weapon choice, fencers will play rock-paper-scissors to decide who gets to choose. In the event that opponents do not have a weapon in common, teams can either use their substitute if they have one, or both fencers forfeit 0-0.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salem Fencing Club","address":"2455 McGilchrist St. SE","city":"Salem","state":"OR","zip":"97302","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":44.9169675,"longitude":-123.0119354,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":110313,"tournament_id":27884,"tournament":"The Josh Fowler Memorial Fill the Stocking","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Team Epee, Saber, Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":36,"is_team":false,"description":"Team Epee, Saber,","close_of_reg":"2014-12-22T18:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27002,"name":"Liberty Chinese Food & Movies 3Weapon Fencing Open","start_date":"2014-12-24","end_date":"","comments":"Officially sanctioned Philly Div of USFA.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.
