It was once one of the largest fencing events in the Southeastern U.S. (comparable to the Crescent City Open), drawing competitors from Florida, as well as international fencers from Latin America and Europe. Its name comes from, obviously, the color of the UF mascot, but also the event's proximity to St. Patrick's Day. The last consecutive annual tournament was held in 1999. The event was revived on its 40th Anniversary in 2006. Unfortunately, we were not able to hold the event in 2007 due to an abrupt venue cancellation. 2008 will mark the 42th Anniversary of the Green Gator Classic.\r\n\r\n\r\nFees\r\nPre-registration\r\n$25 First event; $20 Additional events\r\n\r\nDoor\r\n$35 First event; $20 Additional events\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation, Directions, and Parking\r\nThe tournament will take place in the Florida Gym, which is located on Stadium Road next to Ben Hill Griffin Stadium (\"The Swamp\").\r\n\r\nFrom I-75, take exit 387, Newberry Road. When you get off of the ramp go east for five miles; eventually Newberry Road becomes University Avenue (Note: You should pass the Oaks Mall on your right a quarter mile after traveling on Newberry Rd.) Continue traveling EAST on University Ave. Turn RIGHT onto Gale Lemerand Drive (you will see the Hillel Center on your left.) The stadium will be on your LEFT. At the first light, turn LEFT onto Stadium Rd. Keep driving past the south side of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and you will see the Florida Gym on you left side.\r\n\r\nOn weekends you can park anywhere except RED 1 (24hr enforcement) without a decal. The nearest parking lots are the one beside the Florida Gym, and the one east from Ben Hill Griffin Stadium and adjacent to the Stephen C.

It was once one of the largest fencing events in the Southeastern U.S. (comparable to the Crescent City Open), drawing competitors from Florida, as well as international fencers from Latin America and Europe. Its name comes from, obviously, the color of the UF mascot, but also the event's proximity to St. Patrick's Day. The last consecutive annual tournament was held in 1999. The event was revived on its 40th Anniversary in 2006.

This year, there will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2007-2008 age requirements: \r\nYouth-8:  born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12: born in 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14: born in 1993-1996\r\n\r\n(Fencers who are on the USFA national point standings in one age bracket are also eligible to compete in the next higher age bracket.)\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.  The first series ended at Youth Progressive #4 and was based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4; the second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8.  Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil, Youth-12 Foil, Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.  \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1.  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event.  If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2.  Events are mixed (boys and girls).  Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender.  (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3.  Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments.  Point standings will be posted at www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4.  The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series.  For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n------------------\r\nSchedule (close of registration times & award ceremony times):\r\n\r\n9:00am: Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n10:30am Y8 Foil\r\n12:30pm Awards ceremony for Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee &

All fencers must wear uniforms, sneakers are OK.  This is not an USFA sanctioned event, and USFA membership is not required.  Fencers who compete in Y12 must have birth year of 1995 or after, and for U17 1991 or after.\r\n\r\nThe bouts will be played on shorter than standard length strips, and limited refereeing will be available.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT:\r\nThis goal of the event is to provide fencers with opportunity to practice their skills in competitive environment, and to provide them with maximum number of bouts.  The tournament will have following format (subject to change):\r\n\r\n- Pool (Swiss System). There will be one large pool, and we will use modified Swiss System.  The matching for each round will be based on the ranking obtained from previous rounds.  The system will try to match fencers with similar skills in each round.  Bouts will be fenced to 5 points.\r\n- Direct Eliminations. The seeding will be based on the ranking obtained after the pool. Every place will be fenced off, which means that you are not eliminated after you lose your first direct elimination.  Bouts will be fenced to 15 points for U17, and 2 of 3 5-point bouts for Y12.\r\n\r\nCONTACT:\r\nBoyko or Rayna Krastevitch \r\nPhone: 727-686-2321 \r\ne-mail: krastevitch_b@hotmail.com \r\nhttp:\/\/www.fencingacademy-tampa.org \r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED:\r\nY12 Mixed Epee -

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"FAP","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Phiiladelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24421,"tournament_id":5348,"tournament":"Philadelphia Y14 Sabre","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-03-29T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4344,"name":"SAS Saturday Foil Div 2","start_date":"2008-03-29","end_date":"","comments":"Time to get ready for Divisional Qualifiers, earn a new rating, or just have fun.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"waiting\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Waiting list policy:<\/b>\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"policy\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.

Double touches are possible.\r\n\r\nSome examples: \r\n\r\n- Fencer 1 attacks with a lunge, fencer 2 counterattacks with a fleche, both hit valid target. 1 has right-of-way and hits valid and so scores a touch. 2 hits valid on a fleche and so also scores a touch.\r\n\r\n- Fencer 1 attacks with a fleche, fencer 2 parries and ripostes off target. Fencer 1 remises on target. 1 hits valid on a fleche and so scores a touch. 2 has right-of-way but hits off target and does not score a touch.\r\n\r\n- Fencer 1 attacks with a fleche, fencer 2 parries and ripostes on target. Fencer 1 remises off target. 1 hits off target in a fleche and does not score a touch. 2 has right-of-way and hits valid and so scores a touch.\r\n\r\nFormat: One or two large pools, no DEs (possibly fence off for 1st place if we feel like it).\r\n\r\nCost: free!\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: Brawl in the Salle 7: Fleche of Fury\r\nDate(s): 04\/02\/2008\r\nLocation: Salle Auriol Seattle\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nMixed Fleche of Fury Foil  | Wed 4\/02 | 8:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will start on time, but if you arrive shortly after 8:00 it's very likely you can jump into the event, just ask!\r\n\r\nThis event is unrated, but entrants will earn points tracked for the series on FRED so you can see how you measure up to your team mates.\r\n\r\nAll Salle Auriol fencers are encouraged to participate, even if you've never thought of competing before.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=5821\r\nPreregistation closes on 04\/01\/2008\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
