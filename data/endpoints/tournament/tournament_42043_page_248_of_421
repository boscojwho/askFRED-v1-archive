Smells like  .... college football.\r\n\r\nCELEBRATE NATIONAL COLLEGE COLORS DAYS!\r\nWelcome to Winter Garden Fencing Academy's promotion of higher education, sanctioned by USFA Central Florida Division, Inc.  This is a team tournament that requires USFA membership.  Registration closes midnight, Wednesday, 08\/26\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE POINT\r\nLast year, we first promoted NCCD (www.collegecolorsday.com) on a larger scale and set a record with 23 teams.  Let's do it again!\r\n\r\nAll proceeds will be donated to AVID at Lakeview Middle.  AVID is a nationwide program designed to help underachieving students with high academic potential.\r\n\r\n<b>Form a team representing your favorite college!  Wear you college colors!<\/b>\r\n\r\n\r\nTEAM ENTRY IS ONLY $60!!\r\nThat's only $20 per head, lower than the typical entry fee.  Fees are required to complete registration and can be made on AskFRED, or by check made payable to Winter Garden Fencing Academy, 44 South Main Street, Winter Garden 34787.  The check must be received prior to the close of registration or we must reluctantly remove your entry.\r\n\r\nIndividual events are designed to give a little more fencing opportunity to those who want to play a little longer!  The Unrated foil event needs to have at least 6 fencers... and someone gets to leave with a BRAND NEW E!  The youth 10\/12 event is currently combined to give more opportunity to fence.  If enough fencers register that allow for 2 good events, we will have Y10 and Y12 as separate events.   \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VENUE AND CONTACTS ...\r\nLakeview Middle School\r\n1200 West Bay Street\r\nWinter Garden, FL  34787\r\n\r\n\r\nWGFA Phone:  407-347-3807\r\n\r\nLakeview is only five minutes away from beautiful Historic Downtown Winter Garden where you can find shopping and restaurants.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION AND REFUND POLICY\r\nREMEMBER!  THIS IS FOR EDUCATION!\r\nThe registration fee is non-refundable, unless we cancel your sole event or change the schedule thereby preventing your participation.  This policy drastically reduces the number of no-shows and is in-line with that of Central Florida Division.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT POLICY\r\nThis tournament is about having fun and being just a little on the obnoxious side of things!  Show your college spirit, but don't be a jerk!\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFETY AND ARMORY POLICY\r\nMasks and body cords will be tested as usual.  Full fencing attire is required, including socks that meet the knee.

Names are NOT required on your uniform. Fencers must wear the required clothing regulation fencing jacket and pants, underarm protector (plastron), knee socks and a fencing glove that covers half the forearm. The electric foil bib is required. Women must wear breast protectors. In epee and foil, a full jacket is required (i.e., a jacket with croissard \/ groin strap). \r\n\r\nWarm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing uniforms or gloves must not have any rips, tears, holes, etc. USA Fencing allows uniforms of a single pastel color or designs on the rear (unarmed) arm and leg. As the purpose of uniform color or design is for audience interest, such designs should be in good taste. For safety and insurance purposes, fencers must wear full fencing attire while participating in drills, lessons or warm-up.\r\n\r\nBlade Length: Y8 & Y10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches (\u00930 & 2's\u0094). Parents and fencers are advised that blades marked as \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however some blades labeled as #2 have exceeded 32.5 inches, these blades will not be permitted.\r\n \r\nEQUIPMENT CHECK \r\n\r\nParents and fencers should plan accordingly and arrive at least 1 hour prior to the close of check in, there may be significant lines for equipment check.   Please plan accordingly.\r\n\r\nFencers must present to the armorer for testing of mask, lame jacket, gloves (saber) and body cords. Items passing inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\nAll events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary inspection will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE to ensure the presence of the following equipment: underarm plastron, weapons, body cords and all appropriate weapons check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met. \r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other required equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules. \r\n\r\nFencers will only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the tournament. \r\n\r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords. Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition. \r\n\r\nNote that Blue Gauntlet Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\n\r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.\r\n \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

A percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National Championships for Y12 and Y14. Currently, 100% of Y10 fencers on the Regional Points Standings and National Points Standings gain qualification to the Summer National Championships.   There are NO National Points earned at RYC events.  Y10 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC during the current season to be eligible for the Y10 Summer National Championships.  All athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RYC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their region will not earn regional points.  Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and then Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes residing in the region in which the tournament is held earn regional points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement.   Best 3 results from RYCs within the athlete's region count toward Regional point totals on a seasonal point basis.  At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 regions will be recognized by the YDC, TC and US Fencing. \r\n\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Youth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12 regional points do NOT trickle down to Y10). \r\n\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well.  For more information on youth qualification paths refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook \r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y10\/Y12 to March NAC: <\/i>Fencers must fence in at least one Regional (RYC) or SYC in the current season, OR be on Y10 or Y12 points list to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the NAC\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path to Y14 NAC<\/i>:  Be age eligible\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y10 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y10 NRPS, OR Be on your Y10 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in the Top 65% of your region\u0092s Y12 Regional Youth point standings.\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y12 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y12 NRPS, OR Be in Top 8 of Y10 NRPS, OR Be n the Top 65% of your region\u0092s Y12 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in Top 30% of your region\u0092s Y14 Regional point standings, OR Be in Top 25% of our Division\u0092s Y14 Qualifier\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y14 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y14 NRPS, OR Be in Top 16 of Y12 NRPS, OR Be n the Top 30% of your region\u0092s Y14 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in Top 25% of your Division\u0092s Y14 Qualifier\r\n\r\nClassification Changes - For classifications to be awarded for a youth tournament, the event must meet the criteria of a Group C1 or better.

Athletes without proof of membership must fill out all appropriate forms to pay for membership. Payment will be returned if membership can be verified.\r\nUSA Fencing is working towards an age verification process. An athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via email, mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the database. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and temporary membership cards.\r\nThis season, parents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to: information@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3.

Age eligibility for events is determined by BIRTH YEAR, not age at time of participation.\r\nIf you are not eligible by BIRTH YEAR, but have NATIONAL POINTS for the age group younger than the event you want to enter, you are eligible to fence in that age group. For example, if you are born in 2002, you may only enter CADET if you are on the Youth 14 National Points List for the same weapon.\r\n\r\n<i>At this time, askfred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible.

Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per SYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau.  Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\nNo fence off for 3rd place.\r\nFor Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nFor Y12, Y14 and Cadet events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nAll events serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments, therefore, no events may be combined regardless of number of entrants.<\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS:<\/b>\r\nPlease see the Athlete Handbook for the latest details on points for Super Youth and Regional Cadet Circuit events, as well as qualifications to National Events\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday or Sunday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday or Monday of this tournament.\r\n\r\nBout Committee\r\nBrenda Waddoups -

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 9\/2\/15. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 9\/2\/15) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Any classifications in USA Fencing Events will be awarded according to USA Fencing tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Fencing Flea Market:\r\nDESF will provide tables for a flea market for fencing equipment. Fencers are welcome to bring used or new equipment they wish to trade, sell or donate. Price your own items, or John will be available to help you price any used equipment if you need assistance. Please ensure that the equipment you sell is clean and in good shape. If you are not sure if your used equipment is in good condition, bring it anyway ,and we can evaluate its condition. Important: Please provide contact information (name, telephone, e-mail) at the table, so that buyers may be in touch with sellers. Many new fencers may be looking to purchase used equipment for the first time. Contact information is important in the case the buyer will want to contact the seller directly.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.
