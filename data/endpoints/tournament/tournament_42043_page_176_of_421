The season consists of three individual event dates in the traditional USFA format: a pool round for seeding followed by a direct elimination table which will result in a 1st place, a 2nd place and two 3rd place winners.  Pool bouts are fenced to 5 points, while in the direct elimination round, the athletes will fence best two out of three 5 touch bouts.  Rules are patiently spelled out for a novice child fencer.   Points will be awarded for the top 32 competitors in each event.  Individuals who register for the San Diego Scholastic Fencing Conference will have their results tracked and tabulated for overall SDSFC individual with awards given at an end of the year banquet.  Medals are awarded at each tournament, and results tracked and tabulated for overall SDSFC individual awards given at an end of the year banquet.  The more competitions a child goes to, and the higher their finish, the more points they earn toward the big trophy at the end of the season.  At this age group, we combine foil equipment and epee rules for a friendly, fast event.  We\u0092ve found this combination is perfect for the young fencing student who wants to try their hand at a beginner-friendly tournament.  The matches are fenced with electric foils and foil body cords, but without lam\u00e9s.  This configuration produces a light on the scoring machine for a touch anywhere on the body just like epee, without the need for epee equipment.  No right-of-way rules are enforced, so every touch is rewarded with a point, and it\u0092s possible for two fencers to score at the same time.  The kids have great fun while being introduced to the USFA system of running tournaments based on pools and direct elimination. Registration fees for each individual tournament is $25.00\r\n\r\nMiddle School:\r\nGRADES 5 \u0096 8: MIXED GENDER, TEAM NCAA ROUND ROBIN FORMAT,\r\nTHREE STARTERS AND AT LEAST ONE ALTERNATE PER TEAM, USFA MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED\r\n\r\nFencers compete on teams formed around school affiliations which are club based (e.g. LionHeart Fencing Academy).   If an athlete attends a school with a team, he or she must compete for that team throughout the season.  If an athlete does not have a school team, they will be assigned to a composite team comprised of other \u0093orphans\u0094 from their club.  The season consists of a complete round robin in which all teams rotate to fence the others.  This includes the very first match of the year \u0096 when teammates fence one another.  There are no medals awarded at the meets.  Instead, at the end of the year, awards are given to the top three teams, as well as to the top three men and women in each weapon.  \r\nWhen one team meets another, there are nine 5 touch bouts.  The first team to reach five bout victories claims the team match.  All nine bouts are fenced regardless of the team match score, because the statistics for every individual are tracked for Individual awards. Most of the coaches try to fence all \u0093competition ready\u0094 kids in a match, but that is at the coach\u0092s discretion and is not always possible nor is it guaranteed.  Please realize that when a coach takes an athlete out of competition, or an athlete takes themselves out by not fencing a bout for any reason, they lose a chance at a victory which could affect both their team and individual standing.  It is possible that an athlete could place first as an individual while being on a team that finishes last, or vice versa.  Coaches with outstanding individuals may choose NOT to substitute the athlete, because doing so will jeopardize their chance at an individual medal.  Historically, the top athletes in the conference have the ability to finish the season undefeated, or with only one loss. The conference is non-profit, and charges a one-time seasonal $225.00 registration fee per team.  This fee covers the cost of facility rentals, referee fees, and awards given at the end of the year.  It does not cover the awards banquet, which will be billed separately at $10.00 per person, or $40.00 per family (your choice).   USFA membership is required, for insurance reasons.  The USFA charges $60.00 per year, and membership can be completed on the day of the first event, or online at usfencing.org.  Registration with the USFA and the seasonal conference fees are due on or before the first event.\r\n\r\nTeam Touche Fencing Center \r\n11468 Sorrento Valley Rd.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.

ALL EVENTS ARE CFF SANCTIONED.\r\nNational domestic ranking points are earned on the senior ranking for senior events, and the junior ranking for junior events.\r\n\r\nNote: Events will be cancelled if there are less than 6 people registered \u0096 those fencers who have registered will then be asked if they wish to participate in a mixed event. The CFF Competition Rules allow for up to 5 individuals of the opposite gender to the competition to be mixed in \u0096 the event will still be ranked as a single event. Your points will show up for that weapon and age group.\r\n\r\n---------- EQUIPMENT: ----------\r\nAll entrants must wear proper protective equipment (fencing jacket, sous plastron, breeches, mask and glove) during competition. Masks must pass a punch test (FIE label not required) and be stamped prior to the event. All fencers must wear a plastron (350 N or higher underarm protector) at all times. Weapons will be checked on the piste for all events.\r\n\r\nFoil masks with the lame bib are required in this tournament. Masks that have been retrofitted according to the FIE specifications will be allowed.\r\n\r\n---------- FEES AND REQUIREMENTS: ----------\r\nCost:$25 per event\r\n\r\nPre-registration via the internet is recommended and can be completed on askfred.net. \r\n\r\nPayment will be collected at the registration table on the day of the tournament.

Please do not mail cheques or cash.\r\n\r\nAll entrants must have a current and validated CFF competitive passport or equivalent (e.g. USFA or FIE) prior to the start of the tournament to be allowed to compete. Your CFF\/BCFA membership must be in good standing in order to participate in the tournament. Memberships cannot be purchased at the tournament \u0096 please purchase your passport ahead of time or we may not be able to validate it on the day of the tournament. This is because the CFF will fine tournament organizers $25 per competitor (payable prior to ranking) for those who do not meet licence requirements. We will have the right to refuse you if you do not have a validated CFF licence prior to the tournament. If you wish to renew or purchase a CFF\/BCFA membership, please visit this website ahead of time and make the necessary payments: https:\/\/register.beanstream.com\/scripts\/registration.asp?form=1790\r\n\r\nPre-registration closes on Saturday, March 09, 2013.

We will, however, accept cash in US funds at par at the registration table. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\n---------- WAIVERS: ----------\r\nThe Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition. Waiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament; however, you are welcome to complete the form ahead of time and hand that in at the time of registration. Fencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form and hand that in at the time of registration. If you wish to obtain a copy of the waiver form, please contact us by email. Thank you for your cooperation.\r\n\r\n---------- PRIZES: ----------\r\nMedals will be given to the top four fencers of each event.\r\n\r\n---------- DIRECTIONS: ----------\r\nHere is a link showing the location of the Student Union Building in UBC: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/index_detail.php?locat1=790&show=y,n,n,n,n,y\r\nHere is a map of the UBC campus: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/images\/pdf\/ubcmap.pdf\r\nHere is a Google map of the campus: http:\/\/maps.google.ca\/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6138+Student+Union+Boulevard,+Vancouver,+BC&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=27.881336,81.738281&ie=UTF8&ll=49.268379,-123.250186&spn=0.006875,0.019956&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=0\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] on the map.\r\nThere is a parkade north of the SUB called \u0093North Parkade\u0094 you can park in.\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building between the Student Recreation Centre (SRC) and the War Memorial Gym.\r\nIf you come from the ferry or the border after Oak St Bridge:Option A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive, orOption B: follow Oak Street all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n41st becomes Marine Drive.\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Avenue \u0096 that is the first and only exit on the right close to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights \u0096 do not run the red lights, okay?\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it is a bit far away from the SUB. IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB.\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park. On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $6.00 is required upon entry for parkades.

It's at C-4\/5 on the map.\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n---------- HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS: ----------\r\nAccommodations at the University of British Columbia are available for those who wish to stay on campus for the tournament.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87615,"tournament_id":21411,"tournament":"FAP Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-10T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21426,"name":"BCAF Y-10 and Y-12 Mixed Foil","start_date":"2013-03-10","end_date":"","comments":"NJ Div sanctioned event. $35 for pre-registration on AskFRED by 3\/6. $45 for registrations after 3\/6.

The RCFC SYC is quickly approaching. The competitive MTFC youth have been practicing against each other for much too long. Now it is time to practice against the coaches to get used to fencing rated fencers, faster fencers, and perhaps skilled fencers! Use every trick you have learned. Learn to fight for every point. Beat up a couple coaches and adults if you can! It is just like fencing the SYC kids who are flying out to Bellevue to try to beat you up.\r\n\r\nEVENING FORMAT\r\n\r\nWe will have rated adult MTFC fencers stationed on a strip. Each youth participant will have a score sheet and try to win every 5 touch bout. Cycle through the coaches more than once. Get some tips on what to work on for the next few weeks. If you beat a coach teach them a thing or two. Win or lose it will be good experience fencing those who successfully compete at a level just a bit more than where you are today. You will surely beat all of them regularly soon.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nMTFC youth competitive fencers who are signed up for the SYC get priority. Those competitive youth who are not signed up for the SYC may also attend provided there is space available. If you are motivated but unsure ask coach Toby. Please sign-up on AskFRED so we know how many kids are interested.\r\n\r\nMTFC competitive fencers with ratings of E or above in foil or epee are encouraged to sign up as a coach. We prefer regular coaches and those who compete in more than one weapon. \r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\nYouth participant cost is $15 for the evening from 6:30 PM until 8:00 PM (usual competitive fencing time). \r\n\r\nThe adult coaches who participate will be allowed one child without cost.

Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nSeeding: \r\n\u0095Seeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. \r\n\u0095The Steve Sobel SYC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing.  This information will be downloaded on Wednesday, March 13.  Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings.   Check USA Fencing rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.  Fencers should verify ratings and point standing prior to the event.  Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA.  Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\u0095Each event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in.  Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in.   It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted.

This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc  \r\n\u0095Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes).  Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\u0095Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\nFormat:\r\n\u0095 SYC tournaments are required to have at least 6 competitors for points to be awarded and cannot be a mixed competition. If there are less than 10 competitors there must be fence off for 3rd place).\r\n\r\nEach event consists of two rounds (pools and direct elimination)\r\n\u0095Pools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes.   100% then advance to direct elimination round.\r\n\u0095Direct Elimination Tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round.\r\n\u0095For Y14, DE bouts are 15 touch\/9-minute bouts.   For Y10-Y12, DE bouts are best 2 of 3 5-touch bouts.  Any penalty cards issued during the match of 2 out of 3 five-touch bouts shall be in effect for the entire set of bouts in the match.  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\u0095Medals awarded to Top 8. If there are less than 10 competitors there must be fence off for 3rd place, otherwise there will be no fence-off for third place.\r\n\u0095USA Fencing rules apply as set forth in the USA Fencing Rulebook and as discussed further in the USA Fencing Athlete Handbook (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/About-Us\/Manuals.aspx)\r\n\u0095SYC competitions award points to the top 40% of the field regardless of where the cut-off occurs, i.e. if there are 17 fencers 40% of 17 is 6.8 - only the top 6 finishers (not top 7) earn points. SYC tournaments are required to have at least 6 competitors for points to be awarded. \r\n\u0095Classifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. View USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.  \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\n\u0095Withdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\u0095Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b> STEVE SOBEL BIOGRAPHY<\/b>\r\n\r\nMr. Sobel is a former President of the USFA (1972-1976 and 1992-1996), League Counsel, and past Vice President of the US Olympic Committee.
