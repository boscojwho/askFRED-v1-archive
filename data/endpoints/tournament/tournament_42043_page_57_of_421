Fencers who want to fence at JO's in February must qualify here unless they have Cadet or Junior national points.\r\n\r\nAlso note that the time listed for Cadet Women's Foil on FRED's pre-registration page was incorrect. The correct time (as was listed in all email announcements) is 1:00 PM for Cadet Women's Foil.\r\n\r\nFor sabre fencers and anyone coming to the RCFC Youth tournament on Sunday, remember that this weekend is the Daylight Savings Time change. Don't forget to set your clocks back, or you might show up an hour early!\r\n\r\nAlso, there will be no equipment pre-inspection Thursday evening. All equipment inspections will need to be done on the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: WWD Junior Olympic Qualifiers\r\nDate(s): 11\/01\/2008 - 11\/02\/2008\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 1st\r\n9:00 AM - Doors open\r\n9:30 AM - Junior Men's Foil, Junior Women's Foil\r\n12:00 PM - Junior Men's Epee, Junior Women's Epee\r\n1:00 PM - Cadet Men's Foil, Cadet Women's Foil\r\n2:00 PM - Cadet Men's Epee, Cadet Women's Epee\r\n\r\nSunday, November 2nd\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open (for youth tournament)\r\n12:00 PM - Junior Men's Sabre, Junior Women's Sabre\r\n1:00 PM - Cadet Men's Sabre, Cadet Women's Sabre\r\n\r\nAll times listed are close of registration. Fencing will begin as soon as possible afterward. We will do our best to accommodate fencers fencing multiple events.\r\n\r\nIn each event, the top 25% (rounded up) qualify for JO's, with a minimum of 3 qualifiers. If 3 or fewer fencers show up for an event, the event will not be fenced and all will qualify.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $10 per event entered. Entry fees will not be charged for events that are too small to be fenced.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2008-2009) members of the US Fencing Association, and must be members of the Western Washington Division. As this is a national qualifier, fencers from other divisions or countries are not eligible to compete. Please bring proof of USFA membership to the tournament. You may join or renew your membership at the door.\r\n\r\nAge eligibility:\r\nCadet - born in 1992-1995\r\nJunior - born in 1989-1995\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including fencing pants, long socks, and underarm protector must be worn. Rain City Fencing Center has equipment available for purchase.\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark masks, lames, body cords, sabre mask cords, and sabre overgloves.

Sabre cuffs are required. Original seeding for SSCC events will utilize standard seeding protocols for the Southwest Section Circuit Cup, RYC events will be seeded according to RYC protocols. It is the responsibility of the fencer to notify the Bout Committee at the time of registration if they are on the NRPS. One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches (2 out of 3 five touch bouts for Y10 and Y12). Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash. Organizers reserve the right to limit fencing in cross-over events in order to efficiently run the tournament.\r\n\r\n<b> USFA Membership<\/b>\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. Proof of membership is required.  Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using  most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Waiver of Liability<\/b>\r\nThe North Texas Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/29\/2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30774,"tournament_id":6863,"tournament":"\"D\" Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":19,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-02T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6617,"name":"Tom Wright Memorial Veteran Fencing Tournament","start_date":"2008-11-02","end_date":"","comments":"This tournament is limited to fencers who are 40 years or older.","prereg_open":"2008-08-29","prereg_close":"2008-10-29","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Rockville Fencing Academy","address":"50 Southlawn Court","city":"Rockville","state":"MD","zip":"20850","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.102816,"longitude":-77.132173,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":25,"name":"Capitol","abbrev":"CAP","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30488,"tournament_id":6617,"tournament":"Tom Wright Memorial Veteran Fencing Tournament","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Saber","short_name":"VCmMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-11-02T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":38796,"tournament_id":6617,"tournament":"Tom Wright Memorial Veteran Fencing Tournament","full_name":"VetCombined Men's Foil","short_name":"VCmMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":38797,"tournament_id":6617,"tournament":"Tom Wright Memorial Veteran Fencing Tournament","full_name":"VetCombined Women's Foil","short_name":"VCmWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6619,"name":"MFC Saber Liberty Cup","start_date":"2008-11-02","end_date":"","comments":"$35 if paid through askfred, $50 at the door.
