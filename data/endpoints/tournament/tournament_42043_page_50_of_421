This year, there will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2007-2008 age requirements: \r\nYouth-8:  born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12: born in 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14: born in 1993-1996\r\n\r\n(Fencers who are on the USFA national point standings in one age bracket are also eligible to compete in the next higher age bracket.)\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.  The first series ended at Youth Progressive #4 and was based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4; the second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8.  Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil, Youth-12 Foil, Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.  \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1.  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event.  If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2.  Events are mixed (boys and girls).  Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender.  (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3.

Double entry fee at the door  (I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know how to put a smiley face here, so pretend there is one)\r\n\r\nEquipment must be a full proper uniform with underarm protector.  USFA rules strictly enforced.  The most common uniform problem I see is socks that do not completely cover the legs.  This is a no no!\r\n\r\nThe facility has 4 full size strips with plenty of space for safe refereeing.\r\n\r\nEach strip has the new Virtual Scoring Machine (VSM) computers with Shawn Hart\u00e2\u0080\u0099s latest software.  You will really want to see this!  The reels are a vertical gravity system of my own design.\r\n\r\nThe floor is the best surface I have ever fenced on.  The lighting is first rate.\r\n\r\nWe have bathrooms, changing rooms, a refrigerator, microwave, free coffee, water, space to stow your gear, a lounge and good seating to watch as well.  There is a lot of free parking in our lot and plenty of street parking too.\r\n\r\nThis fencing is on the second floor of the building and there is no passenger elevator in case you or a spectator you might bring that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t climb stairs.\r\n\r\nCome and see the next big thing in Milwaukee fencing.  Also, I would very much like to hear your input on the facility and all things fencing.  Please come, fence, watch and enjoy.\r\n\r\nThere are many businesses and restaurants in the area to supply you with whatever you need, food and beverage wise.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: Milwaukee Sport Fencing Academy Open House\r\nDate(s): 05\/18\/2008\r\nLocation: Milwaukee Sport Fencing Academy\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nMixed Foil  | Sun 5\/18 | 12:00 PM\r\nY12 Mixed Foil  | Sun 5\/18 | 11:00 AM\r\nCadet (U17) Mixed ages 13-17 Foil  | Sun 5\/18 | 11:00 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=5968\r\nPreregistation closes on 05\/17\/2008\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Check out: \r\n\r\nwww.groupfencing.org\/cincinnatifencingclub\r\n\r\nWe did not include the novice results here because we had planned for one event but broke it into two. \r\n\r\nSpecial thanks go out to our volunteers! Thanks to everyone who fenced! Congratulations to the winners! See you at the Botterell! \r\n\r\n******************************************\r\n\r\nCome celebrate the arrival of UC's new baby bearcat and remember dear old Alice at the University of Cincinnati's first fencing tournament. It's a three-weapon D & Under with a dry foil event for novices. First weapon is $15, each additional is $10. \r\n\r\nRegistration will close at: \r\n\r\n9 a.m. for mixed D & under foil.\r\nNoon for mixed D & under saber.\r\n2 p.m. for mixed D & under epee. \r\n2 p.m. for mixed dry novice foil. \r\n\r\nIn each case, fencing will begin shortly after the close of registration. \r\n\r\nA USFA membership is required to fence in the D & under events. Please bring your USFA card to the registration table when you check in. If you joined the USFA online, and don't have your card yet, bring the online confirmation sheet. A USFA membership is <i>not<\/i> necessary to fence in the dry novice foil event. \r\n\r\nParking will be available in the Woodside Garage near the RecPlex. Parking for the entire day will only cost $1 (be sure to tell them you're there for the fencing tournament). \r\n\r\nHere's a map:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.uc.edu\/reccenter\/documents\/UC_Campus_Recreation_Center_Parking_Map.pdf\r\n \r\n\r\nAskFRED preregistration closes May 23. I beg of you, do not preregister for this tournament if you don't really intend to come, or even if you think you might but seriously doubt it. We'd prefer people have an accurate picture of who's going to attend the tournament than inflated one they won't believe. You can also preregister via email by contacting Les Mitchell or Joe Roberts at lesmitchell@fuse.net and jmroberts1979@hotmail.com, respectively. Questions may also be directed to Les and Joe. \r\n\r\nIf you're coming for electric foil, be sure to tell the beginners at your club about the dry event. If you're able to bring them along, electric foil will certainly be finished by the time dry starts, so you can coach them in what may, in all likelihood, be their first tournament. I'm sure they would appreciate it. It's a great opportunity for beginners to get some low-cost, no-pressure tourney experience, and we hope a lot of clubs will be represented in the dry event so that all the novices get to fence some folks they've never met before. \r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"UC RecPlex","address":"","city":"Cincinnati","state":"OH","zip":"00000","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":39.1385934,"longitude":-84.5039837,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":23,"name":"Southwest Ohio","abbrev":"SWOH","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":27083,"tournament_id":5893,"tournament":"BearCat Classic","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":27,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-05-24T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":27084,"tournament_id":5893,"tournament":"BearCat Classic","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-05-24T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":27085,"tournament_id":5893,"tournament":"BearCat Classic","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":17,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-05-24T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5894,"name":"NYC Region Scholastic Empire St Games Qualifiers","start_date":"2008-05-24","end_date":"","comments":"The Empire State Games is an Olympic Style multi-sport event.

The tournament will have following format (subject to change):\r\n\r\n- Pool (Swiss System). There will be one large pool, and we will use modified Swiss System. The matching for each round will be based on the ranking obtained from previous rounds. The system will try to match fencers with similar skills in each round. Bouts will be fenced to 5 points.\r\n- Direct Eliminations. The seeding will be based on the ranking obtained after the pool. Every place will be fenced off, which means that you are not eliminated after you lose your first direct elimination. Bouts will be fenced to 15 points for U17, and 2 of 3 5-point bouts for Y12.\r\n\r\nCONTACT:\r\nBoyko or Rayna Krastevitch\r\nPhone: 727-686-2321\r\ne-mail: krastevitch_b@hotmail.com\r\nhttp:\/\/www.fencingacademy-tampa.org \r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED:\r\nY12 Mixed Epee - Saturday 5\/24\/2008 at 2:00pm\r\nU17 Mixed Epee - Sunday 5\/25\/2008 at 2:00pm\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 4\/24\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 5\/23\/2008.\r\n\r\nRegistration and Check-in will open at 1:00pm each day.\r\nCompetition starts at 2:00pm.\r\n\r\nCOST:\r\nPre-registered competitors: $20 first event, $10 second event\r\nPre-registered TFA Members: $10 first event, $5 second event\r\nAt the door registration: $30 first event, $20 second event\r\n\r\nPlease mail checks with the waiver to:\r\nBoyko Krastevitch\r\n105 Cordova Greeens\r\nLargo, FL 33777","venue":{"name":"Tampa's Fencing Academy: Tampa, FL","address":"7046 W Hillsborough Ave Tampa FL 33634","city":"Tampa","state":"FL","zip":"33634","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":27.996325,"longitude":-82.558732,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":27248,"tournament_id":5947,"tournament":"Tampa's Epee Marathon ","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-05-24T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":27249,"tournament_id":5947,"tournament":"Tampa's Epee Marathon ","full_name":"CadetBelow Mixed Epee","short_name":"Cd-MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"CadetBelow","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-05-25T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5956,"name":"Central Virginia AFL Foil Qualifiers","start_date":"2008-05-24","end_date":"","comments":"American Fencing League dry foil competition.

This is a unique fencing event, so please read this message for complete information about what to expect.\r\n<br><br>\r\nRegistration is at or near the cap of 80.  Since there may yet be fencers who wish to compete, if your plans have changed and you will not make it, please remove your name from the AskFred list so that someone else may take your place.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFor directions to Fort Ticonderoga, accomodations and general information about the fort: www.fort-ticonderoga.org\r\n<br><br>\r\nGates open at 9 a.m.  Please do not arrive before that unless you are coming to help set up.  When you arrive, go to the Log House (the main entryway to the fort, containing snack bar, and gift shop).  Give your name and you will receive a free pass to Fort Ticonderoga.  Your guests will need to pay admission of $10 per adult or teen and $5 per child ages 7-12 (children under 12 are free).  Note that this is reduced admission fee for guests of fencers, (includes a $5 discount), so please encourage your friends and family to use this opportunity to visit this fascinating historic site!  After getting your ticket to the fort, drive downhill past the main parking lot and turn right on the gravel road to the Kings Garden and Pavillion.  As you approach the Pavillion, you will see a parking area on your left.  Park there and walk the rest of the way (it's not far).  If you are helping set up and have more than just personal gear to unload, you may drive a bit closer, but no one is to drive on the grass at any time.  Look for our registration table and pay your entry fee of $15.  Please bring exact change (especially if paying in Canadian dollars).\r\n<br><br>\r\nTournament format (subject to change if bad weather is threatening):  All fencers will be seeded into pools and fencing will start at 10 a.m. with one round of pools.  The top 64 fencers will be promoted to direct elimination.  Those seeded below 64th after pools will not advance to DEs.  This is because we must stay on schedule out of courtesy to the Fort Ti staff,  in order to be cleaned up and out before the fort closes for the day.  Depending on how long the pool round took, the first round of DEs (table of 64) may be fenced to 10 or 15 touches (decision to be made as we go).  The table of 32 and up will be fenced to 15 touches unless we are running unexpectedly behind schedule.  There will be no seperate women's event, however if time permits, we will take the top 8 women from the open and seed them into a women's DE final.  \r\n<br><br>\r\nNew this year:  Pools and preliminary DEs will take place on the lawns in front of the Pavillion (the location we have used the last few years).  We have scheduled a \"gala final\" for 3:30 p.m. in the Parade Ground of the fort itself.  This will consist of the two semi-final bouts of the open (round of 4), followed by the women's gold medal bout, and finally, the gold medal bout of the open.  Why we are doing this: the Ticonderoga Challenge used to take place in the parade ground, which is a remarkable 18th century setting and a major tourist attraction.  As the Challenge got bigger, it was no longer possible to stage the entire tournament there, so we moved to the more spacious Pavillion lawn.  However, when this happened, fewer fencers took the time to visit the fort itself, and fewer fort visitors had the opportunity to witness fencing.  We are going to try moving the final into the parade ground to encourage fencers to come into the fort, and our finalists to entertain the general public with some great epee action.\r\n<br><br>\r\nUSFA Ratings and the Ticonderoga Challenge:  While we expect our competitors to be members of the USFA or Canadian equivalent, and we will use your ratings to seed the initial pools, we will NOT give ratings for placement in the Ti Challenge.   Fencing outdoors can be pretty different from a standard indoor meet, with factors like sun in your eyes, slippery or sloping terrain, blowing dust, reluctance to go for toe touches, etc., influencing the outcome.  So the Ticonderoga Challenge is just for fun, glory and a nice trophy - no ratings.\r\n<br><br>\r\nFood: You are permitted to bring your own picnic to the Pavillion lawn, but food may not be brought into the fort itself.  Food is available for sale in the Log House. \r\n<br><br>\r\nChanging areas: There really aren't any near the Pavillion (just a couple of portalets), so if you are shy about changing in your car, you might want to change into your fencing clothes in the Log House bathrooms before driving down to the Pavillion.\r\n<br><br>\r\nEquipment:  All fencing will be electric.  Go for toe touches at your own risk: if you miss, you may gum up your tip with dirt.  You probably don't want to wear you nicest white knickers or indoor fencing shoes.  Wear old knickers (ones you won't mind grass stains on) or other pants made of a resilient material and well overlapped by your jacket.  Fencing surfaces are mostly grass, with some dirt patches.  Grass can be slippery.  Choose your footwear accordingly.  Sunglasses are also helpful.\r\n<br><br>\r\nWeather:  If rain is forecast for the afternoon, we reserve the right to use a shortened format in order to finish the tournament early (fewer fencers advancing to DEs, shorter DEs, no gala final, no womens final).   If isolated scattered showers occur, we may combine a shortened format with rain delays in which we cover up our scoring equipment and wait out a passing shower.  If Saturday is predicted to be a wash-out, the raindate for the tournament is Sunday, May 25.  If the weather is too wet to hold the tournament either day, the 12th annual Ticonderoga Challenge will be held in 2009.  If there are any messages regarding the weather (including postponement to the raindate), I will e-mail them to the registered fencers late on Friday night, as well as post them on the Ti Challenge AskFred page.  If you are unable to check e-mail, you may call me up until 11 p.m. on Friday, or after 6:30 a.m. on Saturday: 802-759-2268.  Think good weather for May 24!\r\n<br><br>\r\nAfter-tournament party:  You are invited to my house for an after-tournament party, beginning at 5 p.m.  I live in Addison, Vermont, 8 miles from the Champlain Bridge.  From Ticonderoga, follow Route 9N through Crown Point and then signs for the bridge to Vermont.  Cross the bridge and bear left onto Route 17.  Go about 6 miles to the Addison 4-Corner Store and intersection with Route 22A.  Go straight across the intersection another 0.9 miles and turn right onto Mountain Rd.  Go 1.4 miles to my house, 1379 Mountain Rd, red house with wooden mailbox on your left.  Bring food and drinks to share (potluck).  Barbecue grill will be available.  You can pick up food at the Walmart in Ticonderoga (no other supermarket there), or a more limited selection at the Addison 4-Corner Store, or if coming via ferry, at Pratt's Store in Bridport.\r\n<br><br>\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to e-mail or call me.  See you at Ticonderoga!\r\n<br><br>\r\nViveka\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fort Ticonderoga National Historic Site","address":"Route

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"waiting\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Waiting list policy:<\/b>\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"policy\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.
