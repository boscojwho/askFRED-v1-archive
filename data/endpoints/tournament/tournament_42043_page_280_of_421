Fencers listed as incomplete for any event on AskFRED.net at that time will not be allowed to fence in the event(s) indicated.  \r\n\r\n<b> If you have ANY problem with registration, contact us PRIOR TO CLOSE OF REGISTRATION.  We will work with you to get it resolved in the best way possible. <\/b>  You can contact us via email at jennys@wgfencingacademy.com or jasons@wgfencingacademy.com.  You can also call us at (407) 347-3807.\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT CHECK-IN<\/b>\r\nYouth fencers must check-in with their USFA membership card or a letter of good standing, showing current competitive membership.  Athletes without proof of membership must fill out all appropriate forms to pay for membership.  Payment will be returned if membership can be verified. \r\n\r\nParents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes: \r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included \r\n2. A copy of birth certificate \r\n3. Passport \r\n\r\nNote: Once date of birth is verified by the USFA National Office, it is indicated on permanent and temporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nIf you (the fencer) join the USFA at the venue, and are not listed on their official list, you will compete as an unrated fencer to avoid the risk of invalidating your event.\r\n\r\n<b>Equipment Checks<\/b>\r\nFencers will need to bring masks, body cords, mask cords, lames, and gloves for inspection.  Equipment passing inspection will be stamped or tagged.  Please remove past inspection tags from mask cords and body cords prior to presentation at the equipment control table.\r\n\r\nFor your convenience, WGFA will be offering equipment checks on Friday night before the tournament.  Equipment can still be inspected at the tournament venue on Saturday.  Anyone who is coming into town on Friday evening and is interested in avoiding the lines can have their equipment inspected and marked early by visiting our shop at:\r\n\r\n44 S. Main St.\r\nWinter Garden, FL 34787\r\n\r\nFriday evening equipment inspection will be available from 4PM-5:30PM and 7PM-8:30PM.  To be clear, this is not the tournament venue.  This is about 10 minutes from the tournament venue at the home of Winter Garden Fencing Academy.  This Historic District in Winter Garden is full of locally owned restaurants and often has street entertainment on Friday evenings.  Come by, get your equipment checked and enjoy some of the local atmosphere!\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE POLICY<\/b>\r\nNote that the posted time for each event is the close of check-in for that event.  If all fencers for an event have checked in early, that event may start early (given availability of strips, referees, and readiness of the fencers to begin).  \r\n\r\nThe listed mixed events will be split by gender as needed on the day of the tournament.  Per USFA RYC guidelines, events must be split by gender into separate male and female events if 5 or more males and 5 or more females are entered for the same weapon by age-group.  \r\n\r\nPer the Athlete's Handbook, at least 2 participants must compete in an event.  There is no auto-qualify for a single entry.  There will be 100% promotion to direct elimination.  Per USFA RYC guidelines, all events must have both a pool round for seeding and direct elimination.  Thus, in the case of just 2 competitors in an event, the competitors would fence each other twice to determine the final results.\r\n\r\n<b>AWARDS<\/b>\r\nIf 10 or more fencers compete in an event, medals will be awarded to all 8 finalists; otherwise, medals will be awarded for first through third places (with no fence-off required for third place).  \r\n\r\nFor mixed events, no distinction will be made in medal awards based upon the gender of any fencer - only the final placement in the event. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CONDUCT POLICY<\/b>\r\nZERO TOLERANCE FOR POOR CONDUCT. This applies to every person in the venue. Staff members deserve respect and appreciation for doing a tough job for which few volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFEREES\r\nAll of our referees are experienced and rated by the RC, and are SafeSport certified (where age applicable).  <b>Point-of-fact disagreements will not be entertained by the Head Referee or Bout Committee.  If you suspect a misapplication of a rule, bring your complaint to the attention of the referee and\/or head referee.<\/b>\r\n\r\nSAFETY AND EQUIPMENT POLICY\r\nFull fencing attire is required, as specified in the paragraph 2.6 (page 31) of the USFA Athlete Handbook.\r\nDuring the initial equipment inspection at check-in, masks, body cords, and head cords will be tested and marked (stamp on mask, colored tape or other mark on cords) to show they pass inspection. Other equipment and uniforms will be inspected upon reporting to the strip for the round of pools and again for each direct elimination bout.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion.

Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2008-2011\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2002-2005\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=34833\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/28\/2016\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Please see separate details for the novice event below:\r\n\r\nFor the USFA competitions, all USFA rules will apply. Masks, bodycords and lames will be checked at the armory before competition.\r\n\r\n<b>AGES:<\/b>\r\nBirth Year Requirements\r\nIf a fencer's USFA membership card does not show his or her birth date, he or she must bring proof of age to registration.

Copies will be available at the venue. You can also download and print your own: https:\/\/app.box.com\/s\/j8a12ltuhjrckczgj8bk\r\n\r\nFencers under age 18 must have a <b><i>parent's signature<\/i><\/b> on this form.\r\n\r\n<b>USFA\/US Fencing Membership:<\/b>\r\nCurrent competitive membership of the USFA required <b>(except for Novice events)<\/b>. Membership forms will be available at the venue. If your membership is not pre-validated, you must be prepared to show proof of USFA membership, or at the door, fill out a membership form and pay at that time.\r\n\r\n<b>Novice foil event<\/b> requires at least the $10.00 non-competitive USFA membership. \r\n\r\nYou may only fence in the novice event if you have been fencing for one year OR LESS. This does NOT mean you may fence novice if, for example, you have been fencing epee for years but never picked up a foil until now. This is for NEW FENCERS. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up for novice, you should expect I will be checking your name against past years of USFA membership and FRED results.\r\n\r\nThe novice events MAY be divided into two events at the time of the tournament based upon the ages of the competitors and at the discretion of tournament organizers.\r\n\r\nNovice foil competitions will NOT require the masks with the competition\/lame' bibs. The OLD bibs (the kind epee fencers still use) will be allowed.\r\n\r\nGFC has a limited number of lame's available. If we have one in your size you can rent one for $20.00. (Sorry, James & Susie just inspected our stock and a lot of them failed, so we have fewer we can rent out).\r\n\r\nALL EVENTS (INCLUDING NOVICE) will be fenced in round-robin pools followed by 100% promotion to Direct Elimination rounds.\r\n\r\nMemberships will be available at the venue. SERIOUS NOTE: If your method of payment to the USFA fails you will be retroactively black carded from your events.\r\n\r\nPersons under age 18 MUST have a parent's signature on the USFA form.\r\n \r\n<b>Diversions:<\/b>\r\nHere is a list of links for things to do in Galveston when you are not fencing.\r\n\r\n<b>Texas Seaport Museum \/ The Tall Ship, Elissa<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonhistory.org\/Texas_Seaport_Museum.asp\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pleasurepier\/\r\n\r\n<b>Moody Gardens<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.moodygardens.com\/attractions\/\r\n\r\n<b>Schlitterbahn<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.schlitterbahn.com\/gal\/\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Railroad Museum<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonrrmuseum.com\/\r\n\r\n<b>Lone Star Flight Museum<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.lsfm.org\/\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Duck Tours:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/ducktours\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pier 21 Theater:<\/b> (Three different films: The Great Storm, Galveston-Gateway to the Gulf; and The Pirate Island of Jean Laffite) http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pier21theatre\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pirates!

Being a tourist town, Galveston hotels run the gamut. Of really nice hotels close to the venue there are two that jump out:\r\n \r\nThe Tremont House \r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSTH\/main.wnt?cid=14807\r\n \r\nThe Hotel Galvez\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSHG\/main.wnt?cid=14749\r\n \r\nBoth are \"historic\" hotels operated by Wyndham. Tremont is in the Historic Strand District. The Galvez is on the beach. Neither is quite five minutes from the venue.\r\n \r\nFurther down Seawall Blvd, facing the Gulf of Mexico are three hotels, side by side, offering different price points, as they say. All three face the sea. Most of your drive to the venue would be along Seawall Blvd. from either of these three. It can be a bit busy on a weekend, but you do have the Gulf of Mexico on the right side pretty much 90%\r\nof the way, which can make up for it. In \"high traffic times\" allow fifteen minutes to reach the venue.\r\n \r\nThe San Luis http:\/\/www.sanluisresort.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Hilton http:\/\/www.galvestonhilton.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Holiday Inn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/holidayinnresorts\/hotels\/us\/en\/galveston\/glssb\/hoteldetail\r\n \r\nOne other option that is different but might be fun is Harbor House,which is located along the Galveston Waterfront (near the cruise ship terminals and the waterfront restaurants).\r\nhttp:\/\/www.harborhousepier21.com\/ \r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on
