Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60185,"tournament_id":13930,"tournament":"Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-23T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13939,"name":"Bay Cup @ GGFC: JWE, WE","start_date":"2011-01-23","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2011-01-04","prereg_close":"2011-01-21","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Bay Cup at Golden Gate Fencing Center\r\nhosted by Golden Gate Fencing Foundation\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nJunior (U20) Women's Epee\r\nSenior Women's Epee\r\n\r\nClose of registration:\r\n10:00am Junior WE\r\nNoon    Senior WE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a Bay Cup tournament.

For refunds of event fees, use the refund form on http:\/\/www.wwdfencing.org.\r\n\r\n* - Note: If you do not wish to pre-pay online, contact treasurer@wwdfencing.org for alternate payment options.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to pre-register on AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=13270\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Venue Information ----------\r\n\r\nThe event will be held at:\r\nRain City Fencing Center\r\n1776 136th Place NE\r\nBellevue, WA  98005\r\n(425) 747-6300\r\n\r\nFor directions, visit http:\/\/www.raincityfencing.com\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Tournament Rules ----------\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.  Canadian fencers must be current CFF members.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks.  No jeans or sweatpants allowed.  \r\n\r\nThis year, names are NOT required on fencer uniforms (unlike last year.)\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing has NOT yet adopted the electric foil mask bib, so \"standard\" foil\/epee masks may be used.  Fencers may wear masks with the new bib, but they may not use tape to cover the conductive part (for safety reasons.)  \r\n\r\nUSFA rules require that all participants were born in 1997 or earlier.  The veteran events are open to all fencers born in 1970 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- Equipment Check ----------\r\n\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n  \r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60188,"tournament_id":13932,"tournament":"Y12 NOVICE Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed NOVICE Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"NOVICE","close_of_reg":"2011-01-29T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13940,"name":"River City Rumble","start_date":"2011-01-29","end_date":"2011-01-30","comments":"http:\/\/www.va-usfa.org\/schedule\/20100123.html","prereg_open":"2011-01-04","prereg_close":"2011-01-28","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSaturday at 12:30pm: E & Under Senior Mixed Foil\r\nSaturday at 2:30pm: C & Under Senior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\nSunday at 9:30am: C & Under Senior Mixed Foil\r\nSunday at 12:30pm: C & Under Senior Mixed Epee\r\nSunday at 2:30pm: Y12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nCheck-in for events will open 1 hour prior to the close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $20 per event if pre-registered, or $25 if not pre-registered.\r\n\r\nConcessions and equipment will be available for sale!\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/04\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/28\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Richmond Fencing Club","address":"3411\u00c2\u00bd Carlton St","city":"Richmond","state":"VA","zip":"23230","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":62,"name":"Virginia","abbrev":"VA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60219,"tournament_id":13940,"tournament":"River City Rumble","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":25,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-30T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":60220,"tournament_id":13940,"tournament":"River City Rumble","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":20,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-30T09:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":60221,"tournament_id":13940,"tournament":"River City Rumble","full_name":"EUnder Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"E-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-29T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":60222,"tournament_id":13940,"tournament":"River City Rumble","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-29T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":60223,"tournament_id":13940,"tournament":"River City Rumble","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-30T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13943,"name":"Caldera D & Under","start_date":"2011-01-29","end_date":"","comments":"3 Weapon D & Under!\r\n\r\nEntry Fee is $20 per event.\r\n\r\nThe club entrance is behind the building- Same building as Dollar General.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60768,"tournament_id":14108,"tournament":"Cadet (U17)  Sabre","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Saber","short_name":"CdMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-30T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13104,"name":"MCFC Open and Youth Epee and Saber","start_date":"2011-01-30","end_date":"","comments":"NEW!

You then travel around a mile and you will see the Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA) on your left. Although you can turn in there and follow signs to the Ernst Cultural Center and the parking garage, it can be very confusing. Instead, it is easier to continue on Little River Turnpike just past the campus and make a left on Wakefield Chapel Drive. You will see a large parking garage on your left, and you will turn in the campus on Center Drive and enter the garage main entrance on your left.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The parking garage on campus will be available for all tournament visitors and staff.  There is a fee for use of the parking garage to the extent posted by the college, which controls and receives all parking payment.  In the past this has been $1 per hour with a max of $8 per day, but the college sometimes changes this on short notice.  In addition, the college often does not charge for using the garage on Sundays.  Read all signs government parking restrictions and DO NOT park in surface lots that are marked as being for students only, as you can be ticketed and towed.\r\n\r\nGoogle Link that shows the Campus. Note Center Drive. The first white building is the parking garage, the next building down Center Drive is the Venue. The green arrow in the Google Map is the Ernst Center.\r\nhttp:\/\/tiny.cc\/7txps\r\n\r\nGoogle Map that shows more of the surrounding roads:\r\nhttp:\/\/tiny.cc\/16l9w\r\n\r\n<B>REGISTRATION INFORMATION:<\/B>\r\nRegistration fees and deadlines have been set by USA Fencing and are as follows:\r\n\r\nRegular registration period runs through January 7, 2011 \r\n$40 Registration plus $30 per event\r\n\r\nFrom January 8, 2011 through January 31, 2011\r\nTRIPLE FEES PER USA FENCING\r\n$120 Registration plus $90 per event\r\n<b><i>*** IF YOU HAVE ALREADY REGISTERED AND WANT TO MAKE A CHANGE OR ADD AN EVENT, THIS CANNOT BE DONE THROUGH AskFRED.

Each event will open for check-in one hour prior to the time listed.  Please plan accordingly to avoid disqualification.\r\n\r\n<B>CHECK-IN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DAY OF EACH EVENT<\/B>\r\nThe venue will open for fencers at 1:00pm on Friday February 4 and at 7:00am on Saturday February 5 and Sunday February 6.\r\n\r\nFencers must check in each day that they compete, within the indicated hours of check-in, or they will be withdrawn from that event. \r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO COMPETE YOU MUST CHECK-IN AT THE VENUE BEFORE THE LISTED DEADLINE WITH THE FOLLOWING IN HAND:\r\n1) the fencer is required to show a USA Fencing membership card (valid for the current competitive season); AND\r\n2) the fencer is required to show a birth-certificate (copy acceptable) or other government-issued identification showing a birth date; AND\r\n3) the fencer is required to provide a fully-completed waiver form that has been signed by a parent or legal guardian.\r\n\r\nTo help us speed registration, please download the waiver form, print it, read it, sign it, and bring it to the table with you. This is especially critical if the fencer does not have a parent\/guardian at check-in.  No one will be allowed to fence without a signed waiver form.\r\n\r\nWaiver Form .PDF - https:\/\/files.me.com\/egrass\/q3ujdl\r\n\r\nNew USA Fencing memberships and new or replacement USFA cards should be obtained through the USA Fencing website before the tournament.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\r\n\r\nAthletes arriving without proof of USA Fencing membership must fill out all appropriate forms and pay for membership at registration even if already a member.  Refund requests can later be made with USA Fencing as appropriate. \r\n\r\nFencers who fail to register by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be made.\r\n\r\nNote that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who withdraw after starting a competition for other than verified medical reasons will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.  Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\n<B>UNIFORMS REQUIREMENTS<\/B>\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. NAMES ARE NOT REQUIRED ON THE UNIFORM.\r\n\r\n<B>EQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS<\/B>\r\nY10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32 inches (also known as \"2\"\u009dor \"0\" blades).\r\n\r\nEquipment check will be open each day of the competition at 7:00 am (1:00 pm on Friday for initial events that day and 4:00 pm for later events). Equipment check will test the mask, lame jacket, gloves and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\" All events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: Underarm plastron, 2nd weapon and body cord, weapon check control marks.  Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\n<B><I>Parents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 2-3pm on Friday and between 7-8am on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly.  Those fencing Saturday or Sunday can have their equipment checked Friday anytime after 5 pm.<\/I><\/B>\r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nNote that Absolute Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order. \r\n\r\n<B>POINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING<\/B>\r\n\r\nSeeding is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking within year classification. Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Clash will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. You can check your USA Fencing rating by downloading and searching for your name here -- http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\/current-membership-listing. You can check your points here -- http:\/\/usfencing.org\/national-points-standings\/current-national-points\r\n\r\n<B>This information will be obtained from USA Fencing on Thursday, February 3. Any discrepancies regarding classifications or points earned must be resolved by this date.<\/B>\r\n\r\nEach event's tentative seeding will be posted at the venue prior to the close of check-in. It will also be posted at http:\/\/live.nffdc.org.\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted.\r\n\r\n<B>COMPETITION INFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS<\/B>\r\n\r\nAlthough athletes are permitted to enter multiple events in one calendar day, we strongly recommend against this. If an athlete chooses to enter multiple events, he\/she will be expected to appear for their bouts when called, and any absence will result in the appropriate penalties according to the rules, including exclusion.\r\n\r\nFailure to report to a strip timely for the start of a bout subjects the fencer to disqualification according to USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nNo flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. Be advised that we expect to have press and other media at this event and to have video, photography, and sound recordings being made.","venue":{"name":"Ernst Cultural Center, Northern Virginia

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":55553,"tournament_id":13123,"tournament":"Div 3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-02-05T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13894,"name":"Bay Cup @ NBFA: JMF3 JWF3 ELMF3","start_date":"2011-02-05","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-12-28","prereg_close":"2011-02-03","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is a Bay Cup tournament.
