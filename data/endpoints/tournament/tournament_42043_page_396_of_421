If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\n<b>Current valid USA Fencing membership is required.<\/b> You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door. Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase. Pizza will be brought in for lunch at $2\/slice.\r\n \r\nOther helpful info:\r\n \r\n* 309 traffic can be busy so leave enough travel time. \r\n \r\n* Phone number is (215) 716-3777.

Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/30\/2021\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Competitors regularly attend from up and down the East Coast and are always welcome.\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\u00e2\u0080\u00a8 The Cup was interrupted during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons by COVID-19 and we are planning to host a complete Cup series this season. The organizers understand the concerns that many fencers will have regarding health and safety protocols . For this reason, the organizers have communicated an expectation to each club hosting an event that they will meet or exceed the standard set for NACs (masking at all times and proof of vaccination) in addition to complying with all local laws. While the organizers will attempt to provide updates via social media, given the speed with which policies can change, the most definitive information regarding health and safety protocols will always be found by calling the club hosting the event.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8\u00e2\u0080\u00a8HOW WILL THE CUP WINNER DETERMINED?\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8In addition to individual event awards, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2021-2022 Cup Standings at the end of the season will be recognized. Awards will be given after the season's final event. 2021-2022 Cup Standings will be determined as follows:\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a81. Each fencer will get credit for points earned at up to three 2021-2022 Cup events (assuming the currently anticipated five events; if a sixth event is added, points can be earned at up to four events)\r\n\r\n2. For each 2021-2022 Cup event, fencers will receive points based on their finish and letter ratings of other participants who finish below them: \r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8<ul>a. Each fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8b. Fencers will earn points equal to the sum of the point values of all fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8c. In the case of Vet Mixed Events, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) below them<\/ul>\r\n3. Ties in the Cup Standings will be resolved in favor of the fencer that received the higher number of points at a single Cup event\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a82021-2022 TRI-STATE VETERANS SABER CUP EVENTS\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a8October 24, 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Lilov Fencing Academy\r\nDecember 12, 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manhattan Fencing Center\r\nJanuary 30, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sheridan Fencing Academy (Manhattan location)\r\nApril 24, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sheridan Fencing Academy (White Plains \/ Westchester County location)\r\nJune 12, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Infinity Fencing Alliance","venue":{"name":"Sheridan Fencing Academy Westchester","address":"72 E Post Rd","city":"White Plains","state":"NY","zip":"10601","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.0273508,"longitude":-73.7684678,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":44,"name":"Westchester-Rockland","abbrev":"WST-RCK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":192482,"tournament_id":49367,"tournament":"2022 Veteran Sabre Smackdown!","full_name":"VetCombined Women's Saber","short_name":"VCmWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-22T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":192483,"tournament_id":49367,"tournament":"2022 Veteran Sabre Smackdown!","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Saber","short_name":"VCmMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":32,"prereg_count":32,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-22T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"}]},{"id":50396,"name":"Metro Div Summer Nationals Foil Qualifiers","start_date":"2022-05-22","end_date":"","comments":"Please read Info page carefully.
