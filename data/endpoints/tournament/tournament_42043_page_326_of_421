What are teams made up of?\r\n2 person teams\r\n\r\n2. What is the format?\r\nPools are 5 touch bouts with only one touch needed against the team, meaning not both teammates have to be \"out\" to score a touch.\r\nDEs are 5 touch bouts but both team members must be tagged.\r\n\r\n3. How does that work?\r\nIn pools, 2 people teams fence each other at the same time. Any fencer can hit the other team whether they are in front of them or crossed diagonally. Only one touch against any of the other team is needed. Double touches count as double touches.\r\nIn DEs, same rules apply, but only one person per team can be tagged out at a time unless its a double. If team A tags one person on Team B, then it will be a 2 vs 1 situation. The Team with both members still in will start at their back warning line and the single team member will move all the way up to start the touch. Once one team is tagged out completely, the touch is awarded and it starts over again. If there is a 1 vs 1 situation and a double touch is scored, both teams are awarded a point unless it is a la-belle situation.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email swordsinc@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Burbank Swords Studio","address":"134 S.

This upgrade can be done on a personal device, or via a paper application provided by the Bout Committee. \r\n**Those in a \"pending\" status who refuse to upgrade to a Competitive Membership at the event will not be allowed to participate in KSG.\r\n** Any discrepancies between the USFA and a fencer's membership status will be handled by the fencer. It is the fencer's responsibility to contact the USFA and request a refund.\r\n\r\nPREREGISTRATION AND REGISTRATION:\r\n\r\n**CLOSE OF PREREGISTRATION is 7\/23\/18, 5 days before the event. \r\n**Fencers are to pay registration and event fees via AskFRED. Fencers will not be considered to be preregistered without pre-payment via AskFRED and walk-on fees will be charged.\r\n\r\n**No pre-payment via AskFRED, or otherwise, will be accepted after the close of preregistration ( 7\/23\/18). If you have preregistered on AskFRED, but made no pre-payment by 7\/23\/18, you will be considered a walk-on at the tournament and will pay $70 for your first event.\r\n\r\n**The registration portion of the entry fee, and any AskFRED surcharges, are non-refundable. Event fees will be refunded for an athlete who needs to withdraw and does so via e-mail to the Organizer on, or before, July 23, 2018. After this date, no portion of the entry fees will be refunded. Refunds will be issued by check two weeks after KSG. Request emails must include the following info:\r\nFencer's full name\r\nTo whom the check shall be issued\r\nMailing address\r\nEvent withdrawn\r\n\r\n**Please endeavor to preregister for all of your events online as to provide the Organizers with a more accurate count of participants.\r\n\r\nYou will need to present your valid 2017-18 USFA membership to register and compete. Plastic cards are no longer being sent to members by the USFA, so please print your card from the USFA website to present at registration. To expedite the registration process, it is HIGHLY recommended that you obtain it prior to the tournament. We can also accept the registration shown on the iphone app.\r\nWe cannot guarantee use of a computer for renewal. You may renew on your smartphone or other personal device prior to presenting at registration.\r\nYou need a current USFA membership to preregister on AskFred.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n$45 Registration Fee\r\n$20 First event if pre-registered and pre-paid on AskFred.\r\n$70 First event if registering at the tournament as a walk-on.\r\nIn either case, each additional event is $20. \r\n\r\nWalk ons are to pay their registration and event fees at the bout committee\/registration table, not at the entrance to the venue, or online.

All current USFA rules will be followed, including all equipment inspection requirements. Equipment will be inspected according to requirements posted at the tournament, and a vendor will be present in cases where additional or replacement equipment is required.\r\n\r\n**The bout committee reserves the option of combining the men's and women's veteran,or senior, events into mixed events if there are fewer than 6 competitors in one of the single-sex events. If an event becomes mixed, men and women will still medal separately. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** USFA has approved a rule change to require soft material covering for chest protectors for foil, but that rule change does not take effect until August 1, and does not affect this tournament. Foil fencers may elect to wear the soft covering or not as they choose. Armory will not inspect for this covering.\r\n\r\n**For safety and insurance purposes, fencers and coaches must wear mask and glove while participating in drills, lessons, warm-up, with weapon in hand. Failure to comply may result in removal from the venue.\r\n\r\n**KSG charges an admission fee for spectators (anyone not competing, officiating or volunteering).

Visit http:\/\/www.njfencingalliance.com  NJFA is a member of the NJ Div of USA Fencing. http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nLocated at 50 Burnett Avenue, Maplewood, NJ.  NJFA is conveniently located near all major highways in NJ, NY, CT, and Pennsylvania. Just off Springfield Avenue (via Vermont St). Only a 30 minute train ride from NYC Penn Station (via NJ Transit Mid-Town Direct; http:\/\/www.njtransit.com).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW JERSEY FENCING ALLIANCE:\r\nNJFA is a fully equipped state-of-the-art fencing salle. This 17,500 sf venue offers 19 grounded official USFA fencing strips with central scoring boxes and repeater lights at each end, mens and womens locker rooms, FREE Wireless Internet service, on-site fully equipped Fencing Pro Shop, live results streaming of tournament information, and FREE parking. Overhead monitors also display live results and tournament information.\r\nFor directions, click the Directions link on the FRED tournament home page.\r\n\r\nNJFA is a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization which will utilize the proceeds from this event to continue its corporate focus to introducing the sport of fencing to students at all levels and ages throughout New Jersey who would not have been able to enjoy the sport and all that it provides, including increased self-esteem, confidence and pride.  \r\nNJFA has helped enrich the lives of hundreds of young children and their families.  Along the way our students have experienced exceptional success both athletically and academically.  \r\nNJFA is proud to have assisted so many students to earn scholarships for colleges including Div I programs not to mention the hundreds of students that have utilized the NJA network to assist in college acceptance and employment.\r\n\r\n\r\nREGIONAL YOUTH CIRCUIT:\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level. A percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National Championships for Y12 and Y14. Currently, 100% of Y10 fencers on the Regional Points Standings and National Points Standings gain qualification to the Summer National Championships. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. All athletes whose USA Fencing's membership division is in the region in which the RYC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and then Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes residing in the region in which the tournament is held earn regional points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Best 3 results from RYCs within the athlete's region count toward Regional point totals on a seasonal point basis. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 Tournaments regions will be recognized by the Youth Development Committee, Tournament Committee and US Fencing. Any athlete who is age eligible may compete in an RYC. However, ONLY athletes fencing in their home region will earn Regional Ranking Points for their result.\r\n\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Youth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12 regional points do NOT trickle down to Y10).\r\n\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well.  For more information on youth qualification paths refer to the Athlete's Handbook: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook\r\n\r\nRegular Fee Registration Deadline is August 3rd, 2018. \r\nYOU MUST REGISTER AND PAY VIA US FENCING website \r\nRegister online via USFA events portal here:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/details\/tournaments\/3144#register-now\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT ELIGIBILITY:\r\nEntry is determined by 2018-2019 USFA Birth year requirements and rating restrictions:\r\n\r\nY8:     Born 2010-2013\r\nY10:   Born 2008-2011\r\nY12:   Born 2006-2009, or on Youth 10 NRP List\r\nY14:   Born 2004-2007, or on Youth 12 NRP List\r\nCadet: Born 2002-2005\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES \/ DEADLINES:\r\nRegular Period Registration fee: $30\r\nRegular Period Fee per Event: $45\r\nRegular Fee Entry Deadline: Friday, August 3rd\r\n\r\nDeadline for Refund: July 27th, 2018 \r\n(Only event fees are refundable, not the registration fees)\r\n\r\nLate Fee Entry Period: August 4th -August 7th, 2018\r\nLate Fee Period Registration fee: $60\r\nLate Fee Period Fee per Event: $90\r\n\r\nWalk-In Period Registration fee: $90\r\nWalk-In Period Fee per Event: $135\r\n________________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ THE \"MORE INFO\" SECTION BEFORE EMAILING WITH QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nREFEREES:  If interested in reffing, please email fencer0901@aol.com \r\n\r\nPARKING: Plenty of free parking in our lot with over 200 parking spaces.\r\n\r\nFrom USA Fencing, \"In Cadet there will be no points awarded but we will update classification changes.\" These events are not part of the points system of the RYC.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall (267) 482-9597 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":156851,"tournament_id":39379,"tournament":"Liberty Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-08-12T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":40921,"name":"Escrime For Ice Cream EPEE OPEN at Medeo","start_date":"2018-08-12","end_date":"","comments":"You provide the fencing, we provide the ice cream...

These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen because it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nBeginners are welcome to use club electric equipment. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR FOIL\r\nThis is a mixed gender, mixed age event.  Depending on the size of event, we may group fencers by age or gender group.  The format will be standard pools, 100% promotion to direct eliminations, and a full direct elimination round.

passed away in good humor on March 9, 2012 at the age of 81. He was born in Grand Forks, ND on August 2, 1930. Selberg received his Maitre D'Armes from the Federation International D'Escrime in 1967. In addition to being a fencing master, Selberg was also an abstract, post-impressionist painter. He has a painting in the permanent collection at Minnesota State University Moorhead in Moorhead, MN, and also one at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. On the side of the McCormick building in downtown Fargo, ND is a restored version of his infamous sign painting of 'The Cowboy' that he originally painted in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey). Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas. A sign painter, cartoonist and an artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952, where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine of Arts degrees from San Francisco State University. Selberg taught art in San Francisco and fell in love with fencing in the early 1950's. Fencing first took root in North Dakota in 1960, when Charles moved from San Francisco, where he was the head coach at the San Francisco School of Fencing (run by John McDougall), back to Fargo, ND, where he then founded North Dakota's first fencing school, the Selberg Fencing Academy, which he operated there between 1960 and 1966. The Selberg Fencing Academy (SFA) was originally located at 54 1\/2 North 5th St. in Fargo, but was moved in 1965 to the Fargo Arena building in Island Park in Fargo. Selberg thought that fencing would do well in Fargo because of the long cold winters that forced many people there indoors for physical activity. Fencing competitions in Fargo during that time (including many dual matches between Minneapolis and Fargo) were held either at the SFA or at Moorhead State University (MSU), in MSU's large gym. Between 1960 and 1966, the North Dakota division grew to become the 4th-largest fencing division in the country, and SFA fencers won three Midwest Championships, a Chicagoland Open Championship, and finished in the Top 10 at the U.S. National Championships in Women's Foil two years in a row. In 1966, Selberg returned to San Francisco and taught fencing at the famous Halberstadt Fencer's Club, and also began his 16-year career teaching fencing at the University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College). Known affectionately as Mr. Natural among fencers at the University of California at Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, Maestro Selberg was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, his creative abilities, and his tremendous sense of humor. The fencing masters that taught Charles formed his impressive fencing lineage: German-born Eric Funke, American-born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian-born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on Charles\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd teaching. In 1970, Selberg was a member of the only U.S. foil team to ever win a gold medal at the World Masters Championships. Named one of the 'Great Fencing Masters in History', Charles was the author of the renowned books 'Foil' (1976) and 'Revised Foil' (1993). After retiring from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1982, Selberg moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the Selberg Fencing Academy and created an extensive series of instructional fencing videos and DVDs (http:\/\/www.selbergfencing.com). Master Selberg taught that the greatest benefits that we get from fencing are health and recreation. \r\n","venue":{"name":"Clara Barton Elementary School","address":"1417 6th St S","city":"Fargo","state":"ND","zip":"58103","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":46.8591038,"longitude":-96.7892411,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":35,"name":"Minnesota","abbrev":"MN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":161566,"tournament_id":40691,"tournament":"2018 Charles Selberg Memorial Open","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":8,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-08-18T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41234,"name":"NYFA Pre-Season #3","start_date":"2018-08-19","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2018-08-19","prereg_close":"2018-08-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"  NYFA is happy to team up with MacarOn Caf&#233; to offer sweet rewards to the top fencers of our MacarOn Caf&#233; Cookie &#201;p&#233;e Challenge.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/15\/18.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall (267) 482-9597 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":156852,"tournament_id":39380,"tournament":"Liberty Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-08-19T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":40920,"name":"Bay Cup: Y10WS1,Y10XS1,Y12WS1,Y12MS1,Y14WS1,Y14MS1","start_date":"2018-08-19","end_date":"","comments":"Bay Cup at Premier Fencing Academy","prereg_open":"2018-07-30","prereg_close":"2018-08-17","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"EVENTS:\r\n\r\nY10 Women's Saber\r\nY10 Mixed Saber\r\nY12 Women's Saber\r\nY12 Men's Saber\r\nY14 Women's Saber\r\nY14 Men's Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/30\/2018.\r\nPreregistration extended to 08\/17\/2018.\r\n\r\nBAY CUP REGISTRATION FEES:\r\n\r\nThis is a Bay Cup tournament.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2006-2009) and Senior (2005 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n5:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it's ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior: can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries x place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates and prize themes for the 2018-2019 events:\r\n#1 August 25, 2018, National Dog Day\r\n#2 October 27, 2018, National Chocolate Day\r\n#3 January 5, 2019, National Science Fiction Day\r\n#4 March 2, 2019, National Frozen Foods Day\r\n#5 May 18, 2019, National Learn to Swim Day\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Dr.","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462377,"longitude":-97.237749,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":162952,"tournament_id":41039,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y10Y12 Mixed Intermediate Saber","short_name":"U-Y1012MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"Intermediate","close_of_reg":"2018-08-25T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162953,"tournament_id":41039,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Y10Y12 Mixed Novice Saber","short_name":"U-Y1012MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"Novice","close_of_reg":"2018-08-25T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162954,"tournament_id":41039,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Intermediate Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"Intermediate","close_of_reg":"2018-08-25T17:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":162955,"tournament_id":41039,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","full_name":"Unsanctioned Unrated Senior Mixed Novice Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"Novice","close_of_reg":"2018-08-25T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":40784,"name":"WMFA Epee Season Opener and Team events","start_date":"2018-08-25","end_date":"","comments":"Teams can be formed at the event.

Teams may still be created Saturday morning and those competing in the team event will not be assigned teammates as previously stated. Our goal is that the team competition will close the same time as the individual event (10:30 am).

Although it is not guaranteed, it is likely that those who desire to participate but have registered a team on Askfred will easily find available teammates (early arrival is advisable in this case).

Other competitive opportunities in the ROC tournaments are provided for Veteran (40 & Older) and Division II (C, D, E or U) fencers.
