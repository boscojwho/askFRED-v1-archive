Drive past the security building and stay to the right, driving downward between the wall and the building to your right. Follow signs to Baird Hall. FAP-North entrance is the red double doors past the Dance Conservatory. If there is no parking in the lot by the club entrance you can park in the lot before the security building immediately on your right as you enter the campus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP\/FAP-North events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"FAP-North","address":"7500 Germantown Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19119","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0638924,"longitude":-75.1965129,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70600,"tournament_id":16681,"tournament":"Unclassified Saber FAP-North","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-05T16:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16178,"name":"Regional Youth Circuit - Denver","start_date":"2011-11-05","end_date":"2011-11-06","comments":"Regional Youth Circuit - Denver.

Two of them, Stephen Jan and Dennis Liaw, are fencers.  \r\nOn December 16th, 2011, teams from all corners of the world will gather in Devon in the UK, to begin the long and arduous drive through Europe, North Africa, and the Sahara desert. Destination: Timbuktu! Teams that manage to survive the harrowing journey and cross the finish line intact will donate their vehicles to benefit local worthy causes. They will be donating an ambulance to a local hospital in Mali!  For more on the Last Responders team and the Timbuktu Challenge, visit http:\/\/www.lastresponders.org.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Location & Parking<\/b>\r\nTake the F\/G trains to Carroll Street station or get driving directions at http:\/\/www.brooklynfencing.com\/directions.html\r\nFor more information, visit our website, http:\/\/www.brooklynfencing.com or call 718.522.5822.\r\n\r\nThere is easy street parking around the club; however, be sure not to park in the \"no standing\" red signed zone directly in front of the club - you may well get a ticket even on a weekend.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Entry & Eligibility<\/b>\r\n$30 entry fee - all proceeds go to the Last Responders; bring CASH OR CHECK only, payable to Team MMT (not Brooklyn Fencing).\r\n\r\nYou must belong to the USFA or another FIE federation with proof of membership in order to compete.  Join or renew at http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership.  If you need to join the USFA on-site, you will need a separate check or credit card # for their form.  For the $20 one-day membership option, you MUST complete the membership online at usfencing.org ahead of time and bring your e-mail confirmation with you.\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y14 points will be allowed to fence Cadets.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA and Metropolitan Division sanctioned event. Ratings will be awarded where earned.\r\n\r\nNo refunds! \r\n\r\n<b>Competition Format<\/b>\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination\r\n\r\n<b>PARTY and PRIZE<\/b>\r\nThe winner of the competition gets to drive the Mali-bound ambulance around the block (trust us, this is actually incredibly awesome; bring your driver's license) and a rally t-shirt.\r\nThe top 4 participating men and women winners get a mystery prize from Africa!\r\nJoin us after the competition from 7-12 pm to celebrate the team, the ambulance, and the rally.  Suggested donation for non-fencers attending the party, $10.  T-shirts will be available for purchase.\r\n\r\n<b>Volunteers<\/b>\r\nWe have a few volunteer referees already lined up but are looking for more; if you're interested in donating your time to a great cause, e-mail us at info@brooklynfencing.com.  We can also use volunteers to sell t-shirts etc during the competition, so even if you just want to give us an hour, let us know!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Fencing

Each year we focus on a different segment of our fencing population.  This year, it's women and kids.  You don't have to participate in both the workshop and the tournament, but we really hope you will.  Cost if registered 5 days in advance: $10 for your first event (whether it's a workshop or a competition), $5 per additional event.  First event cost goes up to $20 if you register late.  Register for competitive events here, follow the links below to the \"Clinics\" section of AskFRED to sign up for workshops.\r\n\r\nThe day's schedule:\r\n\r\n10 a.m-11:45.  Women's fencing workshop, led by Viveka Fox. This workshop will focus on the mental aspects of fencing. To quote Yogi Berra, \"half of this game is 90% mental\". Some of the possible topics we will explore: understanding how your learning style and personality affect your fencing, visualization, the flow state, handling pressure and anxiety, planned vs improvised actions. This will be an active workshop (we will be doing lots of exercises and actual fencing, not just talking!). While no sabre competition is scheduled for the afternoon, female sabre fencers are welcome to the clinic (but bring a partner, so you have someone to fence with). This clinic is suitable for all teen and adult female fencers, from newbies to experienced competitors.  Calling all woman warriors!  Sign up here: http:\/\/askfred.net\/Clinics\/whoIsComing.php?clinic_id=16342\r\n\r\n10 a.m.-11:45. Kids Mini-camp, led by some of our best teen and young adult fencers (tba).

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70491,"tournament_id":16653,"tournament":"Div. 3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16414,"name":"Stas Krivosheev Annual Memorial Cup","start_date":"2011-11-06","end_date":"","comments":"$200 CASH PRIZE TO FIRST PLACE OF THE OPEN!!!!\r\nThis is the 3rd of a series of youth and open sabre competitions to be held at Nellya.","prereg_open":"2011-09-27","prereg_close":"2011-11-05","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is the 3rd of a series of youth and open sabre competitions to be held at Nellya.

Whether an event is fenced or not, services are rendered to ensure fencers are properly qualified and eligible to participate in the Junior Olympics.  Event fees ($10 each) are refundable if three or less entries are received.  GUARANTEED.  Late registrations are triple the registration fee, payable at the door.\r\n\r\nIf you join the USFA at the venue, and are not listed on their official list, you will compete as an unrated fencer to avoid the risk of invalidating your event.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TEAM EVENTS POLICY<\/b>\r\nTeam event registration is free!!!  If your event is actually fenced (4 or more teams register), then only the $10 per head fee is applicable at the door. If the event must be fenced, and your team does not make the trip, it will be fined, by the Division, triple the total event fee.  Failure to pay will result in denial of team registration for future events.\r\n\r\nTo register your team, contact the organizer. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE POLICY<\/b>\r\nTimes posted will change based upon participation.  Unlike typical local tourneys, qualifiers must include all applicable events on the schedule.  As it becomes clear which events must be fenced, the schedule will adjust for the benefit for all.  Keep checking back.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>CONDUCT POLICY<\/b>\r\n\r\nZERO TOLERANCE FOR POOR CONDUCT. This applies to every human soul in the venue. Staff members deserve respect and appreciation for a doing a tough job for which few volunteer.\r\n\r\nDO NOT ASK TO REPLACE A REFEREE. We go above and beyond to select the best referees the local community has to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>SAFETY POLICY<\/b>\r\n\r\nMasks and body cords will be tested as usual. Full fencing attire is required, including socks that meet the knee. If you show up with crew socks (or no socks), you will not be permitted to fence.\r\n\r\nConductive foil bibs are not required for this qualifier, per the USFA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Jessie Brock Community Center","address":"310 North Dillard Street","city":"Winter Garden","state":"FL","zip":"34787","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.570271,"longitude":-81.584636,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":67126,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Epee","short_name":"CdWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":67127,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Foil","short_name":"CdWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":67128,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T11:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":67129,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Foil","short_name":"CdMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":67131,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T08:45:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":67132,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T09:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":67133,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":67134,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-06T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":70930,"tournament_id":15776,"tournament":"Central Florida JO Qualifiers","full_name":"Y12 Mixed For the Youth!!
