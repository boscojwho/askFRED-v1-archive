Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We expect to have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2010-2013\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2008-2011\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2004-2007\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=41422\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/18\/2019\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door. Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase. Pizza will be brought in for lunch at $2\/slice.\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: https:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/  (see bottom of page) \r\n","venue":{"name":"Bucks County Academy of Fencing","address":"287 South Main Street","city":"Lambertville","state":"NJ","zip":"08530","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.356958,"longitude":-74.9430713,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":168174,"tournament_id":42284,"tournament":"BCAF M\/W Foil Opens & M\/W \"U\" Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-01-20T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":168175,"tournament_id":42284,"tournament":"BCAF M\/W Foil Opens & M\/W \"U\" Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"U-SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-01-20T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":168176,"tournament_id":42284,"tournament":"BCAF M\/W Foil Opens & M\/W \"U\" Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"U-SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-01-20T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41520,"name":"San Diego Senior Cup #3 - 6W Open w\/ UCSD Fencing","start_date":"2019-01-20","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2018-09-02","prereg_close":"2019-01-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nSenior Women Epee\r\nSenior Men Epee\r\nSenior Women Foil\r\nSenior Men Foil\r\nSenior Women Saber\r\nSenior Men Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/02\/2018.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/19\/2019.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\nStandard - Single round of pools, 100% promotion to single Direct elimination table. \r\n\r\nThere will be medals for the top three finishing fencers in each event.\r\n\r\nNote: Fencers must complete their first event before competing in a second one.

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of three separate tournaments spread throughout the season, each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on a weighted point formula.\r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\nOur Grand Prizes have been brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event and date, along with a guitar strap, stand and wall mount worth several hundred dollars!  The Overall Series Champion will also have their name and club affiliation engraved on our perpetual silver trophy cup which is on continuous display!\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to top-8 finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.  Separate medals will be awarded to the top 3 female fencers who finish in each event.  Custom Gold, Silver, and Bronze framed records will be awarded to top 3 places in each Open Mixed Event.\r\n\r\nFor more info about our club visit www.musiccityfencingclub.com\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Epee \r\nC & Under Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 12\/03\/2018.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/25\/2019.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695067,"longitude":-86.6757848,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":169062,"tournament_id":42518,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":27,"prereg_count":33,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-01-27T16:00:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":169063,"tournament_id":42518,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":36,"prereg_count":38,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-01-27T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":169064,"tournament_id":42518,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":25,"prereg_count":32,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-01-26T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":169065,"tournament_id":42518,"tournament":"Music City Series #2","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":21,"prereg_count":31,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-01-26T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":42264,"name":"Bloody Winter Wonderland at NKFA","start_date":"2019-01-26","end_date":"","comments":"Warm up with some serious stabbing! \r\nUSFA competitive membership required.\r\nCost: $25, $35 for 2, and $45 for 3 events.

A percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National Championships for Y12 and Y14. Currently, 100% of Y10 fencers on the Regional Points Standings and National Points Standings gain qualification to the Summer National Championships. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. All athletes whose USA Fencing's membership division is in the region in which the RYC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and then Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes residing in the region in which the tournament is held earn regional points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Best 3 results from RYCs within the athlete's region count toward Regional point totals on a seasonal point basis. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 Tournaments regions will be recognized by the Youth Development Committee, Tournament Committee and US Fencing. Any athlete who is age eligible may compete in an RYC. However, ONLY athletes fencing in their home region will earn Regional Ranking Points for their result.\r\n\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Youth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12 regional points do NOT trickle down to Y10).\r\n\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. For more information on youth qualification paths refer to the Athlete's Handbook: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook\r\n\r\nRegular Fee Registration Deadline is December 28th, 2018. \r\nYOU MUST REGISTER AND PAY VIA US FENCING website \r\nRegister online via USFA events portal here:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/details\/tournaments\/3224\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT ELIGIBILITY:\r\nEntry is determined by 2018-2019 USFA Birth year requirements and rating restrictions:\r\n\r\nY8: Born 2010-2013\r\nY10: Born 2008-2011\r\nY12: Born 2006-2009, or on Youth 10 NRP List\r\nY14: Born 2004-2007, or on Youth 12 NRP List\r\nCadet: Born 2002-2005\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES \/ DEADLINES:\r\nRegular Period Registration fee: $30\r\nRegular Period Fee per Event: $45\r\nRegular Fee Entry Deadline: Friday, December 28th\r\n\r\nDeadline for Refund: December 28th, 2018 \r\n(Only event fees are refundable, not the registration fees)\r\n\r\nLate Fee Entry Period: December 29th January 23rd, 2018\r\nLate Fee Period Registration fee: $60\r\nLate Fee Period Fee per Event: $90\r\n\r\nWalk-In Period Registration fee: $90\r\nWalk-In Period Fee per Event: $135\r\n______________________________________________________________________________\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ THE \"MORE INFO\" SECTION BEFORE EMAILING WITH QUESTIONS\r\n\r\nREFEREES: If interested in reffing, please email fencer0901@aol.com \r\n\r\nPARKING: Plenty of free parking in our lot with over 200 parking spaces.\r\n\r\nRegular entry fee deadline is 11:59 pm on Friday, December 28th.

All events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event.  Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change). NO REFUNDS\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds and women\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club.

Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (maufrich@hotmail.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.
