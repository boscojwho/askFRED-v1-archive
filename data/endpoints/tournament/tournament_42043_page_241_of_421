Proof of membership is required. You may verify your membership and division affiliation at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nPlease resolve any division issues directly with USFA on or before Friday, April 24 2015 so we can verify your eligibility. If you are a new member, you should be aware that you may compete in the division within which you live or the division within which your affiliated club is located.\r\n\r\nUSFA NATIONAL QUALIFIERS ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nAthletes are permitted to fence in their Division qualifying competitions only IF:\r\n1) The athlete is a U.S. citizen OR permanent resident and a current COMPETITIVE member of USA FENCING with an expiration date of 7\/31\/2015 or later AND\r\n2) The athlete is a member of that division AND\r\n3) The athlete represents the United States in international competition AND\r\n4) The athlete's birth year falls in that age bracket OR\r\n5) The athlete is on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket\r\n\r\nAny fencer who is a citizen or permanent resident who has represented another country in the last three years is NOT eligible for any Junior Olympic Fencing Championships competition, individual or team, including corresponding Division qualifying competitions. A foreign fencer who is in the US on a visa is NOT eligible to fence in any National Championships or the Division qualifying competition.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENT FEE STRUCTURE:\r\n\r\n$40 per event if pre-registered on or before 4\/20\/2015\r\n\r\n$80 per event if late registration (between 4\/21 \u0096 4\/24 inclusive); askFRED will not allow pre-registration during the \u0093late registration\u0094 period; you must use the \u0093email the organizer\u0094 feature in askFRED to register late at the $80 per event fee.\r\n\r\n$120 per event walk-in registration\r\n\r\nWe will allow walk-in registrations at the penalty rate of $120 per event. This will be allowed at the bout committee\u0092s discretion. We will not allow walk-ins if we cannot verify the fencer\u0092s eligibility from the information we download from USFA fencing on Friday 4\/24\/2015. If an event has been cancelled because there were fewer than three pre-registrants, we will not allow walk-ins.\r\n\r\nFees are payable by CASH or CHECK ONLY at check-in.\r\nCheck made payable to Central California Division USFA.\r\nWe DO NOT take credit or debit cards.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nBirth years: Born 2001 or before AND ranked C or lower (for Division II). For more detailed age eligibility refer to the following link:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-requirements\r\n\r\n\r\nDETERMINING THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIERS:\r\n\r\nThe number of qualifiers is 25% of the entrants, ROUNDED UP (e.g. 13 fencers = 4 qualifiers) with a minimum of three. If there are three or fewer pre-registrants we will try to contact you. Unless we tell you before the tournament that the event is cancelled, you will need to come, however you might not need to fence. We will not cancel any event before the end of the late preregistration period.\r\n\r\nQualification paths are listed in Chapter 2 of the Athlete Handbook.\r\n\r\nIf the last qualifying spot is tied, there must be a fence off to determine qualification. \r\nFor regional qualifiers, if there is only one entrant the qualifier will not count and the fencer should use an alternate qualification path.\r\n\r\n*Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed or fenced mixed will not result in the athlete fulfilling the qualification requirement.\r\n** Events with 2 entrants will be cancelled and all 2 fencers in those events will auto-qualify.\r\n*** For events with 3 entrants, please show up to fence in this division even though all 3 fencers in those events will auto-qualify.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE OF DETERMINING THE QUALIFIERS:\r\n\r\n(If a fencer is already qualified, how would he\/she impact or change the qualifying event?)\r\n\r\nIn determining the number of qualifiers, the number of competitors is the total number of fencers who competed in the qualifying competition who are eligible to fence in the Championships. Once the qualifying competition is complete and the number of qualified athletes is determined, those who have already qualified to the Championships in that event (athletes determined to be automatic qualifiers) are skipped in determining those who have become qualifiers in that competition. For example, if there are 20 competitors \r\nin the qualifying competition, of whom four have already qualified for that particular championships event, those four are skipped in determining the five qualifiers from that competition. So, if the ones who are automatic qualifiers are 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, then the qualifiers from this competition are those who have placed 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMBINED DIVISION II\/DIVISION III QUALIFIER EXAMPLE\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of how to determine qualifiers for Division III when the Division holds only one competition to determine qualifiers for both Division II and Division III.\r\n\r\nA Division II\/III qualifying competition has the following entries:\r\nNumber of C fencers = 8\r\nNumber of D fencers = 12\r\nNumber of E fencers = 11\r\nNumber of U fencers = 15\r\nTotal Number of Fencers = 46\r\nList the fencers in order of their finish.\r\nThe first 12 who have not already qualified to Division II by other paths are qualifiers from the Division\u0092s competition.\r\nThen count the number of D, E, and U fencers. In this example there are 38 such fencers. 25% of that group equals 10, the number of fencers who can qualify for Division III Nationals.\r\nStarting with the first fencer after those qualified for Division II (in this example, 13th place); count off the next 10 D, E, or U fencers who have not already qualified by other paths. These 10 D, E, or U fencers are qualified for Division III. (Any C fencers in this range are skipped, but not counted against the 10, because they are not eligible to fence Division III.)\r\n--------------------------------------\r\nNUMBER OF QUALIFIERS FOR USA FENCING NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS (25% RULE)\r\n# Eligible Competitors => # Qualifiers\r\n1 => 1\r\n2 => 2 \r\n3-12 => 3\r\n13-16 => 4\r\n17-20 => 5\r\n21-24 => 6\r\n25-28 => 7\r\n29-32 => 8\r\n33-36 => 9\r\n37-40 => 10\r\n41-44 => 11\r\n45-48 => 12\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAFTER THE QUALIFYING EVENTS:\r\n\r\nQualification status after these competitions is not final until confirmed by the National Office.\r\n\r\nThe USA Fencing National Championship Entry Form is posted on the USA FENCING website under Events on the Nationals Tournament web site or competitors may register online at: https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/USFencing\/. \r\nEntries remain pending until results from the qualifying competition are received and processed.\r\n\r\nFor more information about the Summer National Championship, visit the following URL:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/389098?referrer_id=669372\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFIER EVENTS SCHEDULED:\r\n\r\nEvent starting times may be adjusted in order to minimize the interval between close of registration and the start of the event: please MAKE SURE YOUR ASKFRED EMAIL ADDRESS IS VALID AND CHECK YOUR EMAIL DURING THE WEEK PRIOR to the tournament.\r\n\r\nDiv II\/Div III\/Vet Combined Men's   Foil:  9:00AM\r\nDiv II\/Div III\/Vet Combined Women's Epee:  9:30AM\r\nDiv II\/Div III\/Vet Combined Men's   Epee: 12:30PM\r\nDiv II\/Div III\/Vet Combined Women's Foil:  1:00PM\r\nDiv II\/Div III\/Vet Combined Women's Saber: 2:30PM\r\nDiv II\/Div III\/Vet Combined Men's   Saber: 3:30PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/29\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/20\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"The Fencing Center of San Jose","address":"1290 South First Street","city":"San Jose","state":"CA","zip":"95110","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.31803,"longitude":-121.87484,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113247,"tournament_id":28578,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Div II\/III\/VET Summer Nat Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":42,"prereg_count":46,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-26T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113248,"tournament_id":28578,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Div II\/III\/VET Summer Nat Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":18,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-26T09:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113249,"tournament_id":28578,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Div II\/III\/VET Summer Nat Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":18,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-26T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113250,"tournament_id":28578,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Div II\/III\/VET Summer Nat Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":39,"prereg_count":43,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-26T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113251,"tournament_id":28578,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Div II\/III\/VET Summer Nat Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-26T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":113252,"tournament_id":28578,"tournament":"CenCal 2015 Div II\/III\/VET Summer Nat Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":18,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-26T15:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":26788,"name":"California State High School Fencing Championships","start_date":"2015-04-26","end_date":"","comments":"Come join us for the California State Fencing Champs!

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 4\/26\/14.

RYCs serve as a qualifying path for Y10, Y12 and Y14 at the Summer National Championships to be held in San Jose, CA - June 27-July 6, 2015.\r\n\r\nTo participate in the Y10, Y12 and Y14 Summer National events, fencers must qualify - RYCs serve as a qualifying path:\r\n\r\nY10 (born 2004-2007): Be on Y10 Regional Youth point standings at the regular fee entry deadline for these Championships. One RYC IN YOUR REGION accomplishes this.\r\n\r\nY12 (born 2002-2005 or be on the Youth 10 NRPS): Be in the top 50% of your region\u0092s Y12 regional point standings OR\r\nbe in the top 4 of your region\u0092s Y10 regional point standings at the regular fee entry deadline for these championships.\r\n\r\nY14 (born 2000-2003 or be on the Youth 12 NRPS): Be in the top 25% of your region\u0092s Y14 regional point standings OR\r\nbe in the top 8 of your region\u0092s Y12 regional point standings at the regular fee entry deadline for these championships.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Y12 or Y14 fencer's top three Regional point scores from RYCs in the fencers Region are added up. It is Utah-Southern Idaho Division's plan to host three RYCs. If you do not fence in all of them, your kids are at a significant disadvantage to kids from other states in our region or will have to travel out of state to fence three RYCs and be competitive with fencers who do.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe qualifying requirements for the April Youth NAC are simply that Y10 and Y12 fencers participation in ANY RYC in ANY Region or in an SYC. Y14 has no previous participation requirements for the April NAC.\r\n\r\nFencers from outside of Utah should be aware that the Utah-Southern Idaho Division is quite small and that this is exacerbated by the fact that USA Fencing excludes our Southern Idaho clubs from Region 4 RYCs. As a result, our RYCs are all small and despite our best efforts to dragoon fencers and schedule men's and women's event so they can be combined at the last moment, some events are likely to be cancelled for lack of two participants. Accordingly, we are requiring that all pre-registrations be approved. This will be automatic for local fencers but we want to communicate with out of state fencers to clarify and coordinate the risks - so email us.\r\n\r\nThat being said, come play!\r\n\r\nEvents

SYCs are a group of events throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y14, Y12, and Y10 age categories in all six weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn national points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families. This SYC will provide an opportunity to earn national youth rolling points; additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals for Y14, Y12, and Y10 age categories. National Points will be awarded to those fencers placing in the top 40% of the competitive field regardless of where the cut occurs. Fencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nThe Athlete\u0092s Handbook:(http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698380-athlete-handbook) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for summer nationals and should be used as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net. Payment must be made via Askfred.net. Registration is not complete until payment is made. The regular fee registration period begins on 3\/01\/15 and ends at 11:59pm est on 04\/06\/15. The triple-fee registration period begins on 04\/07\/15 and ends at 11:59pm est on 04\/27\/15. All registrations made after 11:59pmest on 04\/27\/15 will be considered walk-ins.

Please make your registrations early to avoid complications.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table. \r\nEngraved medals will be awarded to the top 8 finishers in each event. Classifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. View USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/AboutTournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\n<b>Seeding:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes.

Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Current-Membership-Listing\r\nCurrent points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Athlete-Info\/Rankings\/Current-Rankings.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n1. Current National Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nInitial Seeding will be posted starting April 30th here: http:\/\/www.missionfencingcenter.com\/results \r\n\r\nLive tournament seeding and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results during the event. \r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0974096,"longitude":-75.1452389,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":115361,"tournament_id":29187,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Women's Foil, Epee, Sabre ","full_name":"Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-05-02T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":115362,"tournament_id":29187,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Women's Foil, Epee, Sabre ","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-05-02T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":115363,"tournament_id":29187,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH Women's Foil, Epee, Sabre ","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-05-02T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29703,"name":"Ithaca College Intercollegiate Team Epee Relay","start_date":"2015-05-02","end_date":"","comments":"ONLY college students may participate.

If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

If you are fencing while your next bout is to occur, we will hold the event (wait for you) for a reasonable period of time. As per USA Fencing rules, We will give you 10 minutes between your DE bouts unless you prefer to go ahead and fence (forgoing waiting).  But you must be present for your Event in the venue when it is called. We expect very few individuals, if any, to be affected by this; however, if you are late, fencing other events, etc, and pools are running, you may be skipped *within your pool* and required to fence your concurrent Pool bouts at the Referee's discretion.  \r\n\r\nReminder:  If you are late to the competition, or to your Pools in general for any other reason other than multiple events fenced, and you do not appear at Strip when your name is called, you may be excluded from competition per USA Fencing rules. \r\n\r\n<b>General Example:<\/b>  Men's D 2\/3 Foil (7 people) starts at 9am. Y14 Men's Foil (4 people) starts  9:30am. If you are still participating in a running pool in the D 2\/3 event, we will wait until your last bout has been finished in that D 2\/3 pool before starting the  Y 14 Event. \r\n\r\nHaving said that: *Purposeful* delays of bouts intended to disrupt the smooth running of the competition will be addressed at Referee discretion according to the Penalty Chart. \r\n\r\nShort version:  We will work with you to ensure that you are able to fence the Events for which you wish to compete. \r\n\r\nReminder:  As announced during the original posting of the Athlete Packet (aka \"The Flyer\"), Events with six or fewer fencers will not go to DE (Pool results will stand), and  Events with three or fewer fencers present will not be fenced.
