Then it is \"winner take all\" for the prize.\r\n\r\nSo are you up for the challenge?\r\n\r\nDate: December 20, 2013\r\nTime: 7:15 pm\r\nCost: $10\r\nAges: Youth Fencers under Y14\r\n\r\nPlease bring your electric equipment if you have it.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle d'Etroit Fencing Academy","address":"36745 Amrhein Road","city":"Livonia","state":"MI","zip":"48150","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":42.3747922,"longitude":-83.4061946,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":20,"name":"Michigan","abbrev":"MI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":98943,"tournament_id":24680,"tournament":"SdE Youth Fencing Pentathlon","full_name":"Unsanctioned Youth Mixed Multi-Weapon Foil","short_name":"YMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Youth","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"Multi-Weapon","close_of_reg":"2013-12-20T19:15:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24975,"name":"Thrust Fencing Academy Sabre U","start_date":"2013-12-20","end_date":"","comments":"Registration is open to all USFA members. $35 fee (cash or check) for preregistered fencers. $40 day of.","prereg_open":"2013-12-07","prereg_close":"2013-12-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Registration is open to all USFA members, and if you're not a member you can join at the tournament. $35 fee (cash or check) for preregistered fencers. $40 day of. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 12\/6\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/20\/2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Thrust Fencing Academy","address":"35 South Broadway (NYACK YMCA)","city":"Nyack","state":"NY","zip":"10960","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.0906519,"longitude":-73.9179146,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":44,"name":"Westchester-Rockland","abbrev":"WST-RCK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":100208,"tournament_id":24975,"tournament":"Thrust Fencing Academy Sabre U","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-12-20T18:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22937,"name":"NSFC Epee Round Robin","start_date":"2013-12-20","end_date":"","comments":"NSFC is continuing its Open Round Robin Series.

Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $15 plus tax for the single event. Participants in the Western Washington Foil Challenge series can buy a season pass to all six tournaments (plus a T-shirt) for $75 plus tax.\r\n\r\nThe Western Washington Foil Challenge is a \"best 4 of 6 series\". Tournaments will be held on 11-15, 12-21, 1-3, 3-22, 4-4, and 6-8.\r\n\r\nEach tournament will stand on its own. Medals for the top 4 in each tournament will be awarded.\r\n\r\nTrophies will be awarded as follows:\r\nFor the \"best 4 of 6\"\r\n\r\nTop Senior Male\r\nTop Senior Female\r\nTop Vet (40+)\r\n\r\nAlso for those who have fenced four out of six, there will be a prize for the most improved rating by number of places. For example, a \"U\" to a \"D\" would be two places as would a \"C\" to an \"A\". If two fencers advance the same number of places the award will be settled by either pistols at dawn or rock-paper-scissors. More than that there will be a drawing.\r\n\r\nThose who fence in all six tournaments will be entered in a drawing for yet another prize.\r\n\r\nOh, and did I mention T-Shirts?! Another fabulous Wilkson original!\r\n\r\nCurrent (2013-2014) USFA competitive membership or equivalent is required; you may join or renew at the door.\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants and long socks, is required. Also make sure your weapons will pass the weight test on the strip!\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs.

Barb started fencing at Morris Hills High School (NJ) and continued as a college club fencer at Purdue University.  She served as the NJ division chair for over 10 years, coached Morris Hills High school for 21 years, served as USFA bout committee chair for many, many national fencing tournaments and Junior Olympic Championships, served as USFA Vice President from 2000-2004, and was honored with a lifetime membership to the USFA.  This RYC honors her work on behalf of young fencers.\r\n\r\n<b>==================================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\nTournament information communications:    Important tournament information will be communicated through the FRED e-mail system.    Be sure your e-mail address is up-to-date.   Visit askfred.net then go to \"My FRED\" to verify your current e-mail address.   \r\n\r\nFollow live results at: http:\/\/www.cobrafencing.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b>==================================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>The RYC (Regional Youth Circuit)<\/b> tournaments are held throughout the season, similar to the Super Youth Circuit tournaments.  There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions.  These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March and\/or July NACs.   Y14 winners qualify for Y14 at SN.    RYC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE license.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nQualification Path for Y10\/Y12 to the March and July NACs:\r\nFencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the March and July NACs.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nQualification Path to Nationals for Y14 from RYC: \r\nPlace first in the Y14 event at a current-season RYC tournament [BoD, October 2010] In mixed events, only the first place finisher is recognized as qualified.\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nRegional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be used for RYC events. End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region. Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS.  Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List.   Each participant gets Region 3 points at this RYC.  The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in.  If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count  towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking.    RYC tournaments will award points to all participants. See the regional guidelines for point allocations at (http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6318\/Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative__1_.pdf).  Allocations depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement.   At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.   These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS. \r\n<b>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Cobra Youth Tournament Series<\/b>.  This is the fourth event in Cobra's series of youth tournaments throughout the season, providing an atmosphere designed to help you become a better competitor, promote positive competition, sportsmanship, and love of fencing.

Tournaments this season are scheduled for Sep 29 (RYC), Oct 20, Dec 8, Dec 22 (RYC), Mar 2, Apr 6 (RYC), June 22.\r\n\r\n<b>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>REGISTRATION AND EVENT FEES <\/b>\r\n<i><b>If you wish to just make a donation but are not planning to fence, after entering and making your payment please remove your entry (or notify us).<\/i><\/b>    Charitable donation receipt available upon request.\r\n\r\nEntry deadline is December 9.
