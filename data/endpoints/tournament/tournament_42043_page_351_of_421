If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

This format is designed to assist youth to have a fuller learning experience at fencing tournaments and to address youth events that have had historically low turnouts. The format involves fencers as volunteer mentors to assist in creating bouting opportunities for youth with the goal of developing a stronger local field of youth fencers. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nDESF Practice Round Robins (Adult\/Teen): These events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability.

For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nPre-registration & Entry Fees: \r\n\r\nUSA Fencing sanctioned events:\r\nProof of membership for the USA Fencing sanctioned events:\r\nPlease show your USA Fencing membership card at check-in for proof of membership.

When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USA Fencing Events will be awarded according to USA Fencing tournament rules and conditions. Fencers this season (2019- 2020) will receive points for attendance and placement at our DESF tournaments toward an end of the season prize (Down East Season Point Challenge). Please inquire regarding details of the system. Rules and standings will be posted at each tournament. Last season (2018 - 2019) Point Challenge Awards will be given at this event.  \r\n\r\nThe Fencing Flea Market:\r\nDESF will provide tables for a flea market for fencing equipment. Fencers are welcome to bring used or new equipment they wish to trade, sell or donate. Price your own items, or John will be available to help you price any used equipment if you need assistance. Please ensure that the equipment you sell is clean and in good shape. If you are not sure if your used equipment is in good condition, bring it anyway, and we can evaluate its condition. Important: Please provide contact information (name, telephone, e-mail) at the table, so that buyers may be in touch with sellers. Many new fencers may be looking to purchase used equipment for the first time. Contact information is important in case the buyer will want to contact the seller directly.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

New for 2019-2020, we will have events in ALL 3 weapons. All participants will earn points towards our Grand Prize, and finalists will receive medals. The Grand Prize, a brand new electric guitar, will be awarded to the overall points champions in all of the Mixed Open Events, along with other awards.\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nRegular Fee Entry Deadline (9\/16\/2019)  = $25 (registration fee) + $15 per event\r\n\r\nPROMOTIONAL DISCOUNT: A-rated fencers receive a waived registration fee (pay event fee only), and B-rated fencers receive a $15 discount!\r\n\r\nLate Fee Entry Deadline (after 9\/16\/2019) = $35 (registration fee) + $15 per event\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of three separate tournaments spread throughout the season, each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on a weighted point formula.\r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Prizes\r\n\r\nOur Grand Prizes are brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event and date, along with a guitar strap, stand and wall mount worth several hundred dollars each!  The Overall Series Champion will also have their name and club affiliation engraved on our perpetual silver trophy cup which is on continuous display!\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to top-8 finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.  Separate medals will be awarded to the top 3 female fencers who finish in each event.  Custom Gold, Silver, and Bronze framed records will be awarded to top 3 places in each Open Mixed Event.\r\n\r\nFor more info about our club, visit: www.musiccityfencingclub.com\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Epee \r\nD & Under Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/12\/2019.\r\nPreregistration closes on 9\/20\/2019.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695067,"longitude":-86.6757848,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":174324,"tournament_id":44082,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":25,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-09-21T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174325,"tournament_id":44082,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":37,"prereg_count":41,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-09-21T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174326,"tournament_id":44082,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":32,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-09-22T16:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174327,"tournament_id":44082,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":30,"prereg_count":37,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-09-22T11:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":174328,"tournament_id":44082,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":16,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-09-22T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":44602,"name":"Windy City Fencing Youth 11","start_date":"2019-09-21","end_date":"","comments":"$30 for preregistration ($35 at door).  \r\n$ 10 for second event. \r\nNOTE Y 11: This is a better break for the fencers in our club.Will use # 2 weapons.","prereg_open":"2019-08-18","prereg_close":"2019-09-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"$30 for preregistration ($35 at door). $ 10 for only for second event .  \r\n\r\nNOTE:  11 and under event.

We\r\nhave always had our fencing tournament in the North Gym of the USF\r\nRecreational Complex. The fencing tournament will still be in the same\r\nfacility, but in the East Gym instead. Signage will be posted by the\r\nnew and old entrances to make sure that people can find it. If you\r\narrive at the facility and cannot find the new venue, either ask the\r\nstaff in the lobby or call me at 352-254-0448. The next important\r\nupdate is parking. Several participants in our summer tournament were\r\nticketed, something that has not happened previously. I spoke to\r\nparking and transportation services regarding the matter. While they\r\nactively ticket from 7:30-5:30 during the weekdays, USF has a policy\r\nthat appropriate parking passes are required 24\/7. As a result if they\r\nrandomly decide to ticket for parking passes over the weekend they are well within\r\ntheir rights to issue a parking citation. A daily visitor parking pass\r\ncan be purchased from the first link attached below. I was told they\r\ncost around $5. If you park without a daily visitor parking pass\r\nand\/or in a parking lot which is not marked for D passes then you do\r\nso at your own risk. Email me if you have any further questions\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNathan Arnold\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usf.edu\/administrative-services\/parking\/permits\/visitor-daily-permits.aspx\r\n<\/i>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n\r\n12301 USF Maple Drive, Tampa, FL - Campus Rec Center\r\n\r\nDirections: Take the Fowler Ave Exit (#265) on I-75, heading West.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change). NO REFUNDS\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds and women\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (maufrich@hotmail.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.
