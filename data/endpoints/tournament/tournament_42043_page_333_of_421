Pools for Cadet events will fence, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. *Please note that Women's epee is the one exception, during which Junior events will come first, followed by Cadet events!*\r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 20 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility\r\nTo fence in JUNIOR events, fencer birth year must be between 1999-2005.\r\nTo fence in CADET events, fencer birth year must be between 2002-2005.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies BEFORE the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nNew padded chest protectors are required for foil. (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/news_article\/show\/922236)\r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

All events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event.  Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.

NO REFUNDS\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds and women\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (maufrich@hotmail.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (maufrich@hotmail.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7662642,"longitude":-73.9793077,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":166628,"tournament_id":41873,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #2 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-18T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":41119,"name":"Atlantic Fencing Academy -Sunday Youth SABER","start_date":"2018-11-18","end_date":"","comments":"Saber Youth 10-12-14 competition Sanctioned event, except Y8.","prereg_open":"2018-08-09","prereg_close":"2018-11-16","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":15,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Atlantic Fencing Academy \r\nOne Sheila Drive, Tinton Falls, NJ 07724  \r\nhttps:\/\/goo.gl\/maps\/4HAFiPDKGxL2\r\n\r\nSunday, Nov 18, 2018 - Youth-10-12-14 + Youth-8 Saber Tournament\r\n\r\n\r\nSchedule:\r\nAll times are close of registration.

If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Typically pools begin approximately 15-30 minutes after close of check-in, tournament conditions permitting.  Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.   \r\n\r\n<B>HOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE I WILL BE FENCING?<\/B>  Listen for announcements, and shortly after check-in closes for your event pool strip assignments will be posted on-line at  https:\/\/fencingtimelive.com?t=1306 and on monitor tower located near the Finals Strip.  There is no wi-fi in the venue; internet access is through your cell phone or other provider.   Take spare weapons and body cords with you when reporting to the strip for your bouts.  USA Fencing Rules apply (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book).\r\n\r\n<B>WHAT DO I DO AFTER MY POOL IS FINISHED?<\/B>   After finishing all your pool bouts, the referee will show you the pool score sheet.  You must check scores for accuracy, then sign the pool sheet and thank the referee.   If there are any errors, do not sign until the error is corrected.  Once the pool sheet with fencer signatures is submitted there will be no changes made.   When ALL pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.  The DE tableau will be posted and you then report to the strip(s) indicated for your event and listen for the referee to call you.  Notify the referee if you need to leave the strip area for any reason.   You are allowed 2 calls to the strip, then if not present at the 3rd and final call you will be scratched.   The DE round continues as winners advance until the final bout.  Medals will be awarded to Top 8 finishers.  Medals are awarded at the Finals strip.\r\n<b>==================================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT FORMAT\/RULES<\/b>\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 USA Fencing rules apply.  https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Equipment check required (mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords). 800N Saber Glove is Mandatory.

There are a number of food options near our club.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 7 PM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $20 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2018-2019 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership. Go to http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership to join.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. A foil mask with conductive bib and mask cord are required. Foil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.  Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2005 or earlier\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":167559,"tournament_id":42123,"tournament":"MTFC Senior Mixed Epee - Andrew's Home!","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":21,"prereg_count":23,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-11-23T19:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":41912,"name":"Mid-South Fencers Black Friday Tournament","start_date":"2018-11-23","end_date":"","comments":"Don't shop till you drop, fence instead!

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: \r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n \r\nCheck USA rating at:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nFencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted.

This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.
