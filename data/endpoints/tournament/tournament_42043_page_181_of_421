You must be an active USFA member to participate in this event. Your mask must withstand the normal punch test and proper attire must be worn (plastrong, knickers, socks, etc).\r\n\r\nThe one-touch epee contest will run as follows: Fencers will be seeded at random; we will simply draw names from the treasure chest.  Each participate will square off with his\/her named competitor in a direct elimination bout.  First one to 1 point wins!  In the case of a double touch, both are eliminated.  \r\n\r\nThe mixed team relay will run as follows:  Fencers will create teams of three (bring a team or join one the day of). Oh, there will be a special \"pirate\" aspect to this relay.  Just a warrrrning. (Of course, we reserve the right to change the format depending on the number of entrees and time remaining in the day.) as of now, the teams will be handicapped based on team member ratings in order to level the playing field.  an \"a\" fencer will give the opponent's team a 4 point lead.  a \"b\" will give 3 pts, a \"c\" will give 2 pts, \"d\" and \"e\" will give one.  so, if your team has an B, C, E, your opponent starts at 6.  if the other team has a 4 point \"gift\", then they \"gift\" the other team 4.  in order to help things along more quickly, points will only be \"gifted\",  \"gifts\" will not cancel each other out.\r\n\r\nPirate outfits and jokes welcome.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"195 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661499,"longitude":-73.9794226,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":84692,"tournament_id":20568,"tournament":"NYAC Sabre Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":18,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-27T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":17763,"name":"Capitol City Youth Classic - RYC","start_date":"2013-04-27","end_date":"2013-04-28","comments":"FREE T-SHIRTS\r\n\r\nPlease note your size when you register.","prereg_open":"2012-08-01","prereg_close":"2013-04-22","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"APRIL 27 - APRIL 28, 2013\r\nAir Park Recreation Center\r\nLincoln, Nebraska\r\nOrganizer: Lincoln Fencing Club\r\nContact: Jennifer Crumbliss  @ 402-677-9463 \r\ntournaments@lincolnfencing.com\r\n \r\nAPRIL 27, 2013\r\n9:00 a.m.          Y14 Foil  (Men & Women) \r\n10:00 a.m.         Cadet (U17) Epee (Men & Women) \r\n11:00 a.m.         Y12 Epee (Men & Women)\r\n12:00 p.m.         Y10 Foil (Men & Women)\r\n2:00 p.m.          Cadet (U17) Foil (Men & Women) \r\n3:00 p.m.           Y14 Sabre (Men & Women)\r\n \r\nAPRIL 28, 2013\r\n9:00 a.m.              Y14 Epee (Men & Women) \r\n10:00 a.m.            Y12 Foil (Men & Women) \r\n11:00 p.m.            Y10 Sabre (Men & Women)\r\n12:00 p.m.             Cadet (U17) Sabre (Men & Women)\r\n1:00 p.m.               Y10 Epee (Men & Women)\r\n2:00 p.m.               Y12 Sabre(Men & Women) \r\n\r\nEVENTS WITH LESS THAN 6 FENCERS OF ONE GENDER WILL BE MERGED WITH THE OTHER GENDER'S EVENT.\r\n\r\nPLEASE INDICATE YOUR T-SHIRT SIZE AND QTY\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT WILL BE CHECKED, PLEASE BRING SHORT (SIZE #0,#2) BLADES FOR Y10 EVENTS\r\n\r\nVENUE:\r\nAir Park West Recreation Center \r\n3720 NW 46th Street (Exit 395 off I-80 West of Lincoln)\r\nLincoln, NE  68524 \r\n\r\nACCOMMODATIONS:\r\nChase Suite Hotels has a special rate for fencers:\r\nStudio Suite - $69 or 2 Bedroom Suite - $99.

Additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals. The top 8 finishers (of those eligible and not already qualified) will qualify for Div IA at Summer Nationals. The top 10% (with a minimum of 4) will qualify for Div II at Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nThis particular ROC is in honor of Coach Jeff Wolfe. It is with a heavy heart that we must inform everyone that Coach Wolfe has passed away recently. This event is now held in his memory. Jeff Wolfe, a longtime coach at Brentwood High School, fenced at New York University. After graduating he became a teacher at Brentwood High School where he began both a Boys' Team and a Girls' Team. The Girls' Team was the first girls' varsity program on Long Island. During his tenure (1971- 1998) the Girls' Team had 18 undefeated seasons, 19 League Championships and 18 Sectional Championships. The team set a N. Y. State record winning 98 consecutive dual meets. Jeff Wolfe's W-L record at Brentwood was 388-14. Eight of his fencers became collegiate All- Americans. Four represented the United States in international competition. In 1987, he was the first recipient of the NFCAA Regional Coach Of the Year Award. In 1988 he was named to coach the US Cadet Team at the Continental Cadet Championships and the World Cadet Championships. Coach Wolfe was a highly respected member of the fencing community, and is greatly missed by all those who knew him.\r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net.

This team will be headed by one or two coaches, chosen from all of that school district\u0092s coaches.  Normally there is a participation limit of one girls team and one boys team per school district, but this year we are waiving this rule in order to field as many teams possible.  Therefore each school district may enter as many teams and fencers as they wish for the All-State tournament.  \r\n\r\nAs an example of how we in the San Francisco High School District choose our All-State team.  We select our team members at our S.F. All-City Tournament, which is held at the end of the fencing season at an individual boys and girls event.  For the boy\u0092s team, up to an additional four boys are voted by all coaches as the All-City Team.  At the end of the All-City Meet, a boy\u0092s team and girl\u0092s team plus coaches are selected from all of our high schools to represent San Francisco in the All-State Tournament.\r\n\r\nThe All-State tournament this year will host girls and boys individual events.  We encourage each district to field any number of girls they wish in a girl\u0092s individual tournament.  The format for both the boys and girls events will be pools, followed by direct eliminations with fence-off for third, where points will be earned by the final placing.  The total points for the top three placing girls or boys from each district will be added together to determine the first place school districts in the girls and boys teams event.  \r\nThe first place team trophy for boys and the first place team trophy for girls are perpetual trophies, which have been in the school systems for years.\r\n\r\nTo enter a team, a letter requesting a seat in the All-State tournament is needed from each school district wishing to participate. \r\nThis letter is requested, along with $30.00 (to cover the costs of prizes and gym rental).  Please make out the check to Pannonia Athletic Club, and bring both to the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst place boys team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\nFirst place girls team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\n\r\nThere will also be 24 medals awarded for:\r\n\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place teams (boys and girls, 3 medals per team)\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place individual(boys and girls)\r\n\r\nNO USFA membership is required, no ratings will be awarded. \r\nAll other USFA rules and regulations apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 04\/03\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/26\/2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Galileo Academy, Bay Street Gym","address":"1056 Bay St","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","zip":"94109","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.8042644,"longitude":-122.4243776,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":6,"name":"Northern California","abbrev":"NORCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":90377,"tournament_id":22201,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Women's High School Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2013-04-27T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":90378,"tournament_id":22201,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Men's High School Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2013-04-27T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21946,"name":"Stoccata April Youth Duel","start_date":"2013-04-27","end_date":"","comments":"This is an unsanctioned youth event.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"195 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661499,"longitude":-73.9794226,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":84689,"tournament_id":20565,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #4 Epee","full_name":"Div1 Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"Dv1SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div1","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-28T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":20321,"name":"Fencers Club NYC Women's Epee Grand Prix V","start_date":"2013-04-28","end_date":"","comments":"Final Event of the NYC Series: $40 if you pre-register through AskFRED, $50 at the door.
