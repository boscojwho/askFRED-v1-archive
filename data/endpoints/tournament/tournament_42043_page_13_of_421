Go about half a mile.\r\nLook for a green street sign on your right that says, \"Hillside School\" and points left.  \r\nTurn left onto SE 46th Way into the \u0093Whispering Heights\u0094 neighborhood.\r\nGo about half a mile to a three way stop.  \r\nDrive straight through it.  The street numbers change several times as it curves, \r\nbut stay on the main drag for about half a mile more \r\nuntil you come to a choice between a right turn up a steep hill or a dead end on 159th Pl SE.  \r\nDrive into the end of the dead end and park on the side of the street \r\n(there is little parking on campus).\r\nWalk down the driveway to Hillside.  Of the three structures you will see, the barn-like one to the left is our (somewhat primitive) gym.\r\n\r\nFor more information contact:\r\nKael Sherrard\r\n5033 159th Pl.

This year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Fence-a-Thon is slated to take place on the night of Saturday, March 18, at St. Andrew\u00e2\u0080\u0099s High School in Victoria, BC.\r\n\r\nThe idea for the Fence-a-Thon was sparked by the death of national and international fencing referee Christian Vidosa, who passed away in November 2004 following a battle with pancreatic cancer.  It is in his name that we will donate one hundred percent of the proceeds of this event to the BC Cancer Foundation, a charity devoted to cancer care and research.\r\n\r\nThe night is sort of a two-part affair:  we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll start at 7pm on March 18 with a run-of-the-mill tournament-style tournament featuring mixed foil, mixed epee, and a 20% chance of light mixed sabre.  Then we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll break for a gigantic midnight feast, and start up again with Mixed Team FLEPEE!, where teams of two foilists and two epeeists will duke it out for the mixed FLEPEE! crown.  Finally, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll finish up with a night of open bouting with a complicated handicap system.\r\n\r\nWhen the horn sounds at 7am on Sunday, March 19, you all get to stop fencing!  And if that wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t already enough of a prize, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll also be handing out fabulous prizes from just about everyone.  Last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prizes included everything from gift certificates to gourmet chocolates to free tattoos and body piercings, and this year we hope to have even more exciting prizes to award to the fencers who fence the most bouts, score the most touches, most clearly need dance lessons, had the best cadet, junior, novice and veteran results, and, of course, to the fencers who raise the most money for the charity.\r\n\r\nPledges forms will be available shortly at http:\/\/members.shaw.ca\/ubik\/CapitalCity\/index.html.  For your family and friends, pledges are a great (and tax deductible!) way to help out a great cause.  For you, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a great way to win prizes, which you can then lord over your family and friends. \r\n\r\nPreregistration is available online at www.askfred.net, and will remain open until midnight Friday, March 17, and please remember that although you are welcome to fence as many events as you wish over the course of the night, you have to pick your favourite for the \u00e2\u0080\u009ctournament within a tournament\u00e2\u0080\u009d portion of the evening.  Entry fees are $20 plus whatever pledges you can find.\r\n\r\nMore information, directions to the venue, etc, are available online at http:\/\/members.shaw.ca\/ubik\/CapitalCity\/index.html.  If you have any more questions at all, or if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d like to come out and join us but need a ride around the city or a (free!) place to crash, please email me at anna_smith@shaw.ca or call (250) 592-8713 and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see what I can do.\r\n\r\nI hope you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re all as excited about this event as I am.  Last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s tournament drew fencers from up and down the Island, all over BC, and even as far away as Calgary for a night of fencing, fun, and fabulous prizes, and raised more than $2200 for a very worthy cause.  This year we hope to make it even bigger and better than ever, but it can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be done without your help.  So register early, register often, and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t forget to tell everybody you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve ever met in your entire life to come out and join in \u00e2\u0080\u0093 your friends, your family, your clubmates, your roommates, your darkest enemies, your secret crushes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 especially your secret crushes \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and anybody else that you can think of.  We\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to see all of them, and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099d love to see all of you.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time, and your consideration.  I hope we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll see you all soon!\r\n\r\nAnna Smith\r\n\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nFRED Announces the 2nd Annual CCFC Fence-a-Thon\r\n\r\nCapital City is proud to present the Second Annual Fence-a-Thon, a twelve-hour fencing marathon to benefit the BC Cancer Foundation.
