Blackwelder. However the campus stretches\nalong N.W. 23rd, which is much easier to find on maps than\nBlackwelder. \r\n\r\nIt\u0092s simpler to orient yourself from Redlands Fencing, 3621 N.W.\n23rd, a mere 2.5 miles due west of the competition venue, and\ndirectly off I-44.\n((http:\/\/home.earthlink.net\/~redlandsfencing\/Directions\/directions.html))\nAs mentioned above, OCU is easy to find on 23rd, so head east from\nRedlands and you can\u0092t miss it.\r\n\r\nOnce you find OCU, you\u0092ll want to turn north on Kentucky. You\u0092ll\npass\r\na law school, a dormitory and some campus apartments. Turn\nright\/east\r\nimmediately past the tennis courts. The competition is at Fredrickson\nFieldhouse next door.

We will, however, accept cash in US funds at the registration table.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.  \r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nHere's a map of UBC: http:\/\/www.ubc.ca\/about\/ubcmap.pdf\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C\/D-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] in the map.\r\n\r\nThere's a parkade north of it, or you can park in the open air parkade between Gate 1 & Gate 2 [at C\/D 5].\r\n\r\nDid you come to the PBI? The Peter Bakonyi International?\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building between the two gyms we used on the left if you were going form the War Memorial Gym to the other gym.\r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry, or the border after Oak St Bridge,\r\n\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive or\r\n\r\nOption B: follow Oak St all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive\u00a0to 16th Ave (at the bottom of the UBC map) that's the first and only exit on the right\u00a0clost to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th\u00a0at the 2nd traffic light, turn left,\u00a0to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights - don't run the red lights, ok?\r\n\r\nImmediately after GATE 1 - look for the totem-like signs - that's the 2nd traffic light turn left into the first parking lot. This lot is the one at C\/D 5 on the map.\r\nI think the rate is $3.50 for the whole day.\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediate,y north of Gate 1, turn left\u00a0at the exit of the lot you're in, pass the tall highrises of Gage Towers.\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C\/D 4\/5 on the map.\r\nSorry, I don't know the all-day rate there.\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE..\r\n\r\nIt's easier if you use the NORTH ENTRANCE at SUB\r\nonce you got in the 1st set of the NORTH doors,\r\nturn left,\r\nup two flights of stairs,\r\nthen left again when you're on the 2nd floor.\r\nThe SUB Ballroom should be right there.\r\n\r\nIt's fairly easy to find.","venue":{"name":"University Of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada","address":"","city":"","state":"","zip":"","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":1969,"tournament_id":570,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":25,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":1970,"tournament_id":570,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":1972,"tournament_id":570,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":2054,"tournament_id":570,"tournament":"Stephen Lazar Memorial Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":28,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":408,"name":"Eugene Spring Open","start_date":"2004-04-17","end_date":"","comments":"Sanctioned event.
