At the light at the end of the exit ramp, take a left heading back over I-65.  Go through the first light (which is just an entrance back onto I-65) until you reach the second light at a fairly big intersection (a BP gas station will be on your right).  At this intersection of Lakeshore Boulevard and Greensprings Highway, turn left heading north on Greensprings Highway (toward downtown).  At the second traffic light, turn left onto Raleigh Avenue.  Then turn left at the second stop sign.  The school will be on your left.  The gym entrance is behind the school.\r\n\r\nIf heading north on I-65 (as if coming from Montgomery), the Lakeshore exit will be about one mile past the Alford Avenue exit.  Take a right at the light at the end of the exit ramp.  You will be taking a left at the same Lakeshore\/Greensprings intersection described above (with the BP station on your right).  Continue following the directions to the school as noted above.\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble finding the venue on the day of the tournament, call (205) 410-8183.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the Birmingham Fencing Club and a full schedule of our tournaments for this season, please visit our website at www.fencingclub.org\r\n\r\nFor results from our most recent tournaments, please see our website or see the results listed at www.AskFred.net\r\n \r\n\r\nBirmingham Fencing Club\r\nVulcan Open Fencing Tournament 2005\r\nEntry Form\r\n\r\nName_________________________\r\nClub__________________________\r\nAddress_______________________\r\nDivision_______________________\r\nE-mail_______________________________\t\r\n\/ \/ Male\t\/ \/ Female\r\nBirth Date ____________Age____________\t\r\nUSFA Number_________________\r\n\r\nCost:  $15 for the first event\r\n            $10 for each additional event\r\n            $15 late fee for registration at the door\r\n\r\nEvent                                Rating\/Year          Fee                  \r\nFoil                                    _____                   ___\t            \r\nEpee                                 _____                   ___\t\r\nSabre                               _____                   ___\t\r\nD & Under Foil               _____                   ___\t\t\r\nBox Lunch                       _____                   ___\r\n   (Pre-Order @ $7 per lunch)\r\n\t        \r\nTotal                                                          $________\t\t\r\nMake checks payable to the Birmingham Fencing Club.\r\n\r\nMail to:  Birmingham Fencing Club\r\n              1425 Montgomery Hwy, Suite 25\r\n              Birmingham, Alabama  35216\r\n\r\nWaiver\r\nI hereby waive and release all rights and claims for damages I may have against the Birmingham Fencing Club, Hall-Kent Elementary School, the United States Fencing Association, the officials, managers, sponsors, and other participants from any and all liabilities arising from illness, losses, injuries or damages I may suffer as a result of my participation in the 2005 Birmingham Fencing Club Vulcan Open fencing tournament.
