Our goal is to make this year\u0092s event even bigger and better than last years which had 1,378 entries in all events. \r\n\r\nOur staff of professionals are ready to once again provide you and your family with another FANTASTIC FENCING EXPERIENCE.  This year\u0092s Steve Sobel newly designed trophies and medals are one of a kind made specifically for this event, a must have in your trophy case. We are expecting another National Quality Event. And remember, by joining us at this competition, you are assisting NJFA a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization to achieve its mission.  NJFA uses the sport of fencing to develop life skills for many students in need throughout New Jersey. Since the program began 2001, it has helped enrich the lives of hundreds of young students and their families. Along the way we\u0092ve had extraordinary success assisting these student athletes reach both their athletic and academic potential. \r\n\r\nThis SYC is in honor of Steve Sobel. Steve Sobel is a former President of the USFA (1972-1976 and 1992-1996), League Counsel, and past Vice President of the USOC. He began his fencing achievements as the 1954 NCAA Saber champion for Columbia University.

Please feel free to visit their booth for all of your fencing equipment and repairs.\r\n\r\nSTEVE SOBEL SYC AND CADET INTERNATIONAL EVENT 2016 DETAILS\r\n\r\nThe Steve Sobel SYC is sanctioned by USA Fencing and their Youth Development Committee and proudly hosted by New Jersey Fencing Alliance (NJFA) from Maplewood, NJ. This SYC is part of a group of National Events held throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y10, Y12, Y14 and Cadet Age categories in all three weapons. USFA competitive membership is required for all events. The Y8 events listed are additional approved events and not part of the Super Youth Circuit.\r\n\r\nThis Elite SYC competition serves as a National Qualifying Event for the Y10, Y12 and Y14 age categories for the same category and weapon at the USFA March Youth NAC and the 2016 Summer National Championships.  Additionally it provides the opportunity to earn National Youth Points in the Y10, Y12, and Y14.\r\n\r\n2016 QUALIFICATION PATHS for March NAC and SUMMER NATIONALS \r\n\r\nMARCH NAC \r\n\r\nY10 & Y12: Fencers must fence in at least 1 Regional (RYC) or SYC in the current season, OR be on the Y10 or Y12 points list to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the NAC\r\n\r\nY14:  Be age eligible\r\n\r\nSUMMER NATIONALS\r\n\r\nY10:  Be on Y10 NRPS, OR be on your Y10 Regional Youth Point Standings, OR be in the Top 65% of your region\u0092s Y12 Regional Youth Point Standings.\r\n\r\nY12:  Be on Y12 NRPS, OR be in Top 8 of Y10 NRPS, OR be in the Top 65% of your region\u0092s Y12 Regional Youth Point Standings, OR be in Top 30% of your region\u0092s Y14 Regional Point Standings, OR be in Top 25% of your Division\u0092s Y14 Qualifier.\r\n\r\nY14:  Be on Y14 NRPS, OR be in Top 16 of Y12 NRPS, OR be in the Top 30% of your region\u0092s Y14 Regional Youth Point Standings, OR be in the Top 25% of your Division\u0092s Y14 Qualifier.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL POINTS \u0096 The SYC competitions will award points to the top 40% of the field regardless of where the cut-off occurs, be it within a pool round or a direct elimination bracket. For example if there are 18 fencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8, therefore only the top 6 finishers will receive points.  The competitive field will be based on eligible (current USFA competitive members and confirmed foreign fencers) athletes in the event. Only the best SYC result will count toward point totals on a rolling point basis. More details with respect to points can be found in the Athlete Handbook.

Live tournament feed: http:\/\/live.njfencingalliance.com. Note: prior to the tournament, any posted seeding information is preliminary and NOT official.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible in accordance with SYC guidelines with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nSYC tournaments are required to have at least 6 competitors for points to be awarded and cannot be a mixed competition.\r\nY10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (two periods of three minutes), with a one minute break between each period. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 touches by either fencer, whichever comes first. During the 1 minute break ONE person, designated by the fencer may be on the strip with the fencer.  (The rules for handling ties in score at the end of regulation, awarding of cards and non-combativity will apply as currently written.) Y12, Y14 and Cadet direct elimination bouts are 15 touch (three 3 minute periods) with a one-minute break between each period.  During the 1 minute break ONE person, designated by the fencer, may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\r\nCadet events with more than 64 entrants may be subject to an 80% cutoff at the discretion of the Bout Committee. Medals will be awarded to the Top 8 places.  \r\n\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply as set forth in the USA Fencing Rulebook and as discussed further in the USA Fencing Athlete Handbook (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/About-Us\/Manuals.aspx) \r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\n\r\nPlease see the Athletic Handbook for the latest details on points for SYC events, as well as qualifications to National Events.\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/~\/media\/USA_Fencing\/Documents\/About%20Tournaments\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\n\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until the complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Friday or Saturday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Saturday or Sunday of this tournament.\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\n\r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\nThe Steve Sobel SYC and Cadet International Tournament will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on Wednesday, February 24, 2016. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved by Wednesday, February 24, 2016 with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.  Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer\u0092s signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, they will be scratched from the pool, and their results will be annulled as if they had not taken part in the competition. \r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete their bout, their opponent will be declared the winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAWARDS & HONORS\r\n\r\n1st Place winners will receive the Steve Sobel SYC and Cadet International Trophy and a one-of-a-kind STEVE SOBEL SYC AND CADET INTERNATIONAL tournament t-shirt. \r\n\r\n2nd thru 8th place finishers will receive the newly designed Steve Sobel SYC and Cadet International medal. \r\n\r\nThis <b>SPECIAL ONE OF A KIND<\/b> T-shirts will be awarded to the <b>FIRST PLACE WINNER OF EACH EVENT<\/b>.\r\n\r\n<b>SYC T-SHIRTS<\/b>: In one word <b>AWESOME<\/b>.

The eligibility guidelines are taken from the Athlete Handbook. RCCs and RJCs held after the Junior Olympic Championships will only accept entries from athletes for which the tournament serves as a qualification path: Therefore the birth years are as follows:\r\nDiv IA: Born 2002 or before (or on the Junior National Rolling Points List), with any rating \r\nEligibility is based on birth year, regardless of the specific day\/month:\r\nCadet: Born in 2000 through 2003\r\nJunior: Born in 1997 through 2003\r\nFencers with Youth-14 National points are eligible to fence in Cadet events.\r\nFencers with Cadet National points are eligible to fence in Junior events.\r\n\r\nROC events function as qualifiers to the National Championships Division I-A, Division II and Veteran Categories, and may qualify fencers to other events, depending upon classification and status. The USFA Athlete Handbook contains detailed information on qualifying pathways and should be consulted as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\nROC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses; however, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USA Fencing National Championship events. An athlete can fence at any ROC and may earn points at any ROC. Regional points are awarded to 40% of the competitive field. In the event that a foreign fencer finishes within the qualifying group, the foreign fencer will be skipped. \r\n\r\nQualification Path to Div1A Nationals from the D1A ROCs\r\nPlaced in the top 8 at the previous season's Div1A National Championships, OR\r\nPlaced in the top 4 at the previous season's Div2 National Championships, OR\r\nBe on the current season's Div1A ROC Regional Point Standings, OR\r\nBe in the top 8 of the Div2 ROC Regional Point Standings\r\n\r\nQualification Path to Div1 July Challenge from the ROCs\r\nBe in the Top 16 of the Div1A ROC points\r\nBe in the Top 4 of the Div2 ROC points\r\n\r\nRegional Points \u0096 The ROCs award points to the top 40% of the competitive field at each ROC event.

Our goal is to create a positive tournament experience and setting for every fencer, while providing a level of professionalism expected of an elite fencing center.\r\n\r\nThe SFSFL incorporates two Circuits within its infrastructure, The Junior & Open Circuit (JOC) and The Individual Challenge Circuit (ICC).  The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.

Events with simultaneous close of registration may not necessarily be fenced at the same time.\r\n\r\nAll events will be fenced mixed (boys and girls together) unless there are at least 5 of each gender in the event. Separate awards for boys' and girls' placements will be given in any case.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility:\r\n\r\nY10 - Fencers born in 2005-2008\r\nY12 - Fencers born in 2003-2006\r\nY14 - Fencers born in 2001-2004\r\n\r\nEquipment Requirements:\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark all lames, masks, body cords, and gloves. Weight testing and other weapon inspection will be done at the strip. Y10 fencers must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nPer USA Fencing policy this season, all saber fencers must use 800N gloves.\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including fencing pants, long socks, and underarm protector, must be worn.

RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil (or sabre) masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2015-2016) competitive members of USA Fencing (or Canadian Fencing Federation).

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list using the link in your confirmation email. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n$50 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 2\/24\/14. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n$70 at the door for late registrations (after 2\/24\/14) and walk-ins (cash or check only).  \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\n***Cash & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE:  9:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2015-16 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2016, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1999-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1997-2003 and for the cadet events 2000-2003.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661648,"longitude":-73.9793922,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":126682,"tournament_id":32082,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #3 Men's Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-02-28T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":32623,"name":"Laramie D and Under Mixed Epee","start_date":"2016-02-28","end_date":"","comments":"USFA Sanctioned D and Under.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch.

Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.

Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\n<b>Uniform Requirements:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (patrick@nyacsabre.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (patrick@nyacsabre.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"195 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661877,"longitude":-73.9794459,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":124312,"tournament_id":31559,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup Sabre #3","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-03-05T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":30799,"name":"Pacific Northwest Cup #4","start_date":"2016-03-05","end_date":"","comments":"Pacific Northwest Cup is a series of 6 tournament for Y10, Y12, Y14 Foil fencers and Y14, Div 2 Epee fencers.\r\nFencers will earn points at each tournament.

There are no national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.
