If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournaments (other than the all-pools format).  The top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify, so the more fencers that show up, the more people qualify.\r\n\r\nFor complete information, see http:\/\/www.wwdfencing.org\/Events\/Divisionals.php\r\n\r\n------------------  Event schedule ------------------- \r\n\r\n---- Friday 4\/28\/06 ----\r\n7:00 pm\r\n -- Doors open\r\n7:30 pm\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Foil\r\n\r\n---- Saturday 4\/29\/06 ----\r\n9:30 am\r\n -- Doors open\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Foil\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Foil\r\nNoon\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Epee\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Epee\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Epee\r\n \r\n---- Sunday 4\/30\/06 ----\r\n9:30 am\r\n -- Doors open\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Saber\r\n -- Division II\/III Women's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Epee\r\n11:00 am\r\n -- Division II\/III Men's Epee\r\nNoon\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Foil\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.

This one time could include the same day on which the team event occurs.  Individuals do not qualify for teams, clubs qualify for teams with the potential for individual fencers who represent the club at nationals to be completely different from those who represent the club at the qualifier.  Five clubs are allowed to qualify without fencing, therefore, if less than 6 clubs pre-register, all qualify and no fencing will occur.  To help defray tournament expenses, no trophies will be given to non-contested events.  Team events are seeded according to how that fencer finished in the open event of the same weapon.   No division patches are given for team events, but will be awarded for non-contested individual events.  For further information, please check the complete rules for qualifiers in the electronic news sent to each USFA member or the confirmation materials included with registration for national events, or contact the division secretary.\r\n\r\nTeam captains who wish to qualify their team must check-in with the names of their team members at the appropriate times.  For Saturday's events, check is is by 10 a.m. Saturday (for Saturday's events.)  For Sunday's events, check-in closes at 4 p.m. on <i>Saturday<\/i> for Sunday's events.  If the captain does not check-in with the names of the team at or before the correct time, the team will forfeit.  If less than 6 teams pre-register by the deadline (April 15) the events will not be fenced, but team captains still must submit team members. \r\n\r\nTHERE ARE NO COMBINED TEAMS... YOU MUST REPRESENT THE SAME PRIMARY CLUB\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive (i.e., Junior, Life, Senior, Veteran) members of the USFA and citizens or permanent residents of the United States.  Fencers may join the USFA at the door.  Please bring your completed USFA membership form and signed waiver with you.  USFA cards must be presented at check-in if you do not appear on or if your classification is different from the Current Members List online.   Fencers under 18 must have a waiver signed by parents.  Waiver may be downloaded from the website and signed by parents prior to the tournament.

Classifications can be awarded at a Division\/Section Summer Nationals qualifying competitions and must be noted on the qualifying report form. Cadet and Y14 events must be C1 or greater for a classification to be awarded. The USFA office will verify eligibility, membership, and the accuracy in determining the number of qualifiers in each event.\r\nAthletes are permitted to fence in their Division\/Section qualifying competitions only IF:\r\n1) The athlete is a U.S. citizen OR permanent resident of the United States and a current competitive member of the USFA And\r\n2) The athlete's birth year falls in that age bracket OR \r\n3) The athlete is on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket. \r\na. Example: For a fencer, born 1994, to be eligible to fence in the Division\u0092s Cadet qualifying competition, the fencer must be listed on the current Youth 14 point standings.

Example: For a fencer, born 1994, to be eligible to fence in the Section Junior qualifying competition the fencer must be listed on the current Cadet point standings. Current is defined as the point standings at the time of the qualifying competitions. \r\n\r\n<b>SUMMER NATIONALS CHAMPIONSHIPS <\/b>\r\nFencers must be U.S. citizens OR permanent residents of the United States and current competitive members of the USFA who MUST meet qualification standards specified for each category to enter the USFA Summer Nationals Championships. \r\n\r\nAny fencer who is not a citizen or is a permanent resident who has represented another country in the last three years and who has not yet been granted permission to represent the USA is not eligible for any USFA National Championship competition, individual or team, including Division and Section qualifying competitions. A foreign fencer who is in the US on a visa is NOT eligible to fence in any National Championships, individual or team, or associated Division or Section qualifying competitions. On the USFA membership list and membership card a foreign fencer is designated with an asterisk after their first name (*). If you have conflicting information about whether a fencer is foreign, contact the USFA at (719) 866-3609.\r\n\r\nFencers must have a USFA \u0093Competitive Member\u0094 card with an expiration date of 7\/31\/06 or later. Automatic qualifiers will be posted on the USFA Web site and updated periodically. \r\n\r\nNRPS stands for National Rolling Point Standings, which can be viewed on the US Fencing website.\r\n\r\nIn determining the number of qualifiers, the number of competitors is the total number of fencers who competed in the qualifying competition who are eligible to fence in the Championships. Once the number of qualifiers is determined, those who have already qualified to the Championships in that event (athletes determined to be automatic qualifiers) are skipped in determining those who have become qualifiers in that competition. For example, if there are 20 competitors in the qualifying competition, of which four have already qualified for that particular championships event, those four are skipped in determining the five qualifiers from that competition. Example: If the ones who have already qualified are 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 7th, then the qualifiers are those who have placed 2nd, 4th, 5th, 8th and 9th.\r\n\r\n<b>DIVISION II CHAMPIONSHIPS <\/b>\r\nFencers must have a classification in the weapon of \u0093C\u0094, \u0093D\u0094, \u0093E\u0094, or Unclassified at the time of the qualifying competition AND born no later than 1992 AND \u0096 \r\n\u0095 Place in the top 25% of the 2006 Division Qualifying competition OR\r\n\u0095 Qualify for Division I-A National Championships OR\r\n\u0095 Qualify for the 2006 Under \u0096 19 National Championships in that weapon OR\r\n\u0095 Qualify for the 2006 Under \u0096 16 National Championships in that weapon OR\r\n\u0095 Placed in the top 4 at the 2005 Division III National Championships \r\n\r\n<b>DIVISION III CHAMPIONSHIPS <\/b>\r\nFencers must have a classification in the weapon of \u0093D\u0094, \u0093E\u0094, or Unclassified at the time of the qualifying competition AND have been born no later than 1992 AND \u0096\r\n\u0095 Qualify for Division II\r\n\u0095 Place in the top 25% of the total number of \u0093D, \u0093E\u0094 or \u0093U\u0094 fencers competing in the 2006 Division\u0092s Division II Qualifying competition (when Division II and Division III qualifying competition is held together) OR\r\n\u0095 If separate Division III qualifying competition is held by the Division, then the top 25% of the field will qualify for Division III National Championships OR\r\n\u0095 Qualify for Division I-A National Championships in that weapon OR\r\n\u0095 Qualify for the 2006 Under \u0096 19 National Championships in that weapon OR\r\n\u0095 Qualify for the 2006 Under \u0096 16 National Championships in that weapon\r\n\r\n<b>UNDER-16 CHAMPIONSHIPS<\/b>\r\nFencers must be born between 1990 and 1993** AND \r\n\u0095 Be on the Cadet point standings as of May 1, 2006 OR\r\n\u0095 Place in the top 25% of the Division\u0092s U \u0096 16 qualifying competition OR\r\n\u0095 By Board action, any fencer who has qualified for the Under-19 National Championships becomes an automatic qualifier for the Under-16 Championships (BOD, 10\/04) OR\r\n\u0095 Be in the Top 8 of the Youth 14 point standings as of May 1, 2006\r\n\r\n<b>YOUTH 14 CHAMPIONSHIPS<\/b>\r\nFencers must have been born between 1991 and 1994** AND\r\n\u0095 Be on the Youth 14 point standings as of May 1, 2006 OR\r\n\u0095 Place in the top 25% of the Division Youth 14 Qualifying competition\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>VETERAN<\/b> Any current competitive member born 1965 or earlier who has competed in\r\n\u0095 2006 Section Championships OR\r\n\u0095 2006 Division qualifying competition for Division II and\/or Division III Championships {only those with a \u0093C\u0094 classification or lower (D, E, or U) may compete} OR\r\n\u0095 Any NAC During the 2005-2006 season\r\n\u0095 Fencer must state on the entry the competition by which he or she complied with qualification criteria.
