In this example there are 38 such fencers. 25% of that group\r\nequals 10, the number of fencers who can qualify for Division III Nationals.\r\nStarting with the first fencer after those qualified for Division II (in this example, 13th place); count off the next 10\r\nD, E, or U fencers who have not already qualified by other paths. These 10 D, E, or U fencers are qualified for\r\nDivision III. (Any C fencers in this range are skipped, but not counted against the 10, because they are not eligible\r\nto fence Division III.)\r\n\r\nWe will be selling concession items such as fruit, water, gaterade, and protein bars. There are plenty of restaurants surrounding Fairfield Fencing Academy our favorites are Garden Catering, Salsa Fresca Mexican Grill, Italian Kitchen,  Mama Mina's,  Archie Moores, and Wings over.

NO ENTRIES WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE ENTRY DEADLINE.\r\n\r\nAfter the entry deadline, we will send an email announcing the following:\r\n\r\nIf an event has 3 or fewer fencers that are not already qualified, the event will not be fenced.

Foil end epee events will be held at Rain City Fencing Center and saber events will be held at Salle Auriol Seattle.  Events will be scheduled so as to not conflict with the Rain City Open and SAS Pirate Cup also being held on the same weekend.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Entry Fees ---------\r\nAll fencers must pay the mandatory $10 registration fee when they sign up on AskFred.  \r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, each fencer will need to pay an ADDITIONAL $10 in CASH on the day of the event (to cover the cost of hiring referees.)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Tournament Rules -------- \r\nDivision II\/III events are open to fencers born in 2008 or earlier.\r\nY14 events are open to fencers born in 2007-2010.\r\n\r\nSince this is a national qualifier, all competitors must be current competitive or \"access\" members of the USFA Western Washington Division and US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n \r\nPlease join or renew your USFA membership online at https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ prior to registering on AskFred.\r\n\r\nFor events that are fenced, full USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks.

Entry fees may be paid in person, or may be charged to your account for RCFC members. \r\n\r\nCurrent (2021-2022) USA Fencing membership (Competitive or Access type) is required. Please join or renew your membership online at https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ before the tournament. \r\n\r\n------------------ COVID Rules: -------------------\r\n\r\nAll events are limited to 42 participants. Register early to make sure you get in! If you pre-registered and are unable to attend, please cancel your pre-registration on FRED or email the tournament organizers as soon as possible, so that another fencer can take your space. No walk-in registrations will be permitted.\r\n\r\nWe will require proof of COVID vaccination or a negative COVID test in order to enter the facility. Masks or facial coverings will be required of all fencers, officials, and spectators at all times, including under the fencing mask, regardless of vaccination status.\r\n\r\nAll spectators should remain in the lobby or upstairs on the mezzanine, and practice social distancing. Only fencers and officials, and coaches during DE breaks, are allowed on the fencing floor.\r\n\r\n------------------ Equipment: -------------------\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants and long socks, is required. Also make sure your weapons will pass the weight test on the strip!\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must wear a new FIE-approved padded protector. Hard plastic chest protectors are still required for women and optional for men, in both weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers may not use foil masks, since the conductive bib can ground out the opponent's point.\r\n\r\nFormat is one round of pools (of size 5 and 6), 100% promotion to direct elimination.\r\n\r\nAge eligibility: This tournament is for fencers born in 2008 or earlier.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=49897\r\nPreregistration closes on 5\/21\/2021 ","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194454,"tournament_id":49897,"tournament":"2022 Rain City Open","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":194455,"tournament_id":49897,"tournament":"2022 Rain City Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":37,"prereg_count":42,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":194456,"tournament_id":49897,"tournament":"2022 Rain City Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":33,"prereg_count":35,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-14T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":194457,"tournament_id":49897,"tournament":"2022 Rain City Open","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-14T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50412,"name":"Bozeman Spring Tournament","start_date":"2022-05-14","end_date":"2022-05-16","comments":"","prereg_open":"2022-04-10","prereg_close":"2022-05-13","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Hosted by Bozeman Fencing Association\r\n\r\nLocation: Bozeman Fencing Association - 15 Tai Lane.\r\n\r\nPlease note the youth event is Saturday and the senior event will be Monday evening.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Entry fee must be paid to be included in the qualification report for the Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nYOU WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE ENTERED IF YOU HAVE NOT PAID THE ENTRY FEE BY May 14, either in person at the meet, or RECIEVED by mail to the Division Treasurer (Christopher Pullo, 21 Fire Road 15, Strafford, NH 03884).\r\n\r\nWALK IN ENTRIES WILL ONLY BE ALLOWED FOR CONTESTED EVENTS and will have to pay an extra $15 late fee ($45 total).\r\n\r\nMost importantly, once the events that do not have to be contested have been determined, many of the contested events will have their close of registration times changed. PLEASE CHECK THE SCHEDULE OF EVENTS AFTER MAY 7 TO SEE WHEN YOUR EVENT WILL ACTUALLY BE HELD.","venue":{"name":"Seacoast Fencing Club- Rochester NH","address":"261 North Main Street","city":"Rochester","state":"NH","zip":"03867","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":43.3096209,"longitude":-70.9904367,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":43,"name":"Northeast","abbrev":"NEST","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":196476,"tournament_id":50401,"tournament":"Y-14 National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":196477,"tournament_id":50401,"tournament":"Y-14 National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":196478,"tournament_id":50401,"tournament":"Y-14 National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":196479,"tournament_id":50401,"tournament":"Y-14 National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":196480,"tournament_id":50401,"tournament":"Y-14 National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":196481,"tournament_id":50401,"tournament":"Y-14 National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-05-15T16:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50150,"name":"2022 Colorado Division Y14,  DivII\/III Qualifier","start_date":"2022-05-15","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2022-03-09","prereg_close":"2022-05-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":25,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Preregistration opens on 03\/09\/2022.\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/08\/2022.\r\n\r\nPRE-REGISTRATION CLOSES ON 05\/08\/2022.\r\n\r\nMay 9th - May 10th -  TRIPLE Registration fees in effect\r\n\r\nPRE-PAYMENT OF NONREFUNDABLE REGISTRATION FEE IS REQUIRED FOR REGISTRATION TO BE CONSIDERED COMPLETE on ASKFRED.
