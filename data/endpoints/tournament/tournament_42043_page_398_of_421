The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Swordmaster's HEMA club for our Rapier Tournament at the UBU Expo inside the Orange County Convention Center!!\r\nLicensed and Sanctioned by AAU  & The Fencing League of America.\r\n\r\nThis is a bring your own Rapier Tournament so naturally they will be inspected before the tournament starts along with protective gear.\r\n\r\nWeapon Guidelines:\r\nAll Rapiers must have a rubber tip or equivalent. Max length is 58 inches from tip to pommel. Only rapier blades can be used. Other blades meant for classical or olympic fencing are prohibited. Blades must be Medium\/Heavy thickness with a minimum flexibility of 0.5\"(12mm). We will be testing the flexibility of each blade being used.\r\n\r\nCost for entry into the Tournament will be collected through Askfred.net\r\n(30$) and AAU membership is REQUIRED (16$) for the sake of insurance. This is only if you don't already have an AAU membership.\r\n\r\nGear inspection will begin at 630pm with the plan to kickoff the tournament at 7pm.\r\n\r\nProtective gear required:\r\nAppropriate head protection with back of head\r\nThroat\/trachea protection\r\nHeavy padded Hema jackets or padded Gambeson, light Gambeson, Modern Fencing jackets(not recommended but allowed)\r\nHard leg protection. 3 points covered and covers the shin\r\nHard elbow protection. 3 points covered.\r\nProtective gloves of a lighter make and model, no lacrosse or hockey, workers or gardening gloves.\r\nGroin protection required for Male fighters\r\nChest protection required for female fighters.\r\nNo exposed skin.\r\n\r\nRapier Tournament Rules\r\n\r\nRound Conditions\r\n-A round shall consist of up to 90 seconds of guaranteed fight time. Timing begins when the director calls \u00e2\u0080\u009cFight\u00e2\u0080\u009d and pauses when the director announces \u00e2\u0080\u009cHold.\u00e2\u0080\u009d If the 90 seconds ends in a draw, a sudden death point will decide the bout in knockout phases.\r\n\r\n-A round will end at either 10 points, or at 90 seconds, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\nPoint Values\r\n-Points will be scored by valid (defined below) cuts or thrusts in the following manner:\r\n-3 points to the mesh or bib of the helmet\r\n-2 points to the torso\r\n-1 point to the limbs\r\n\r\nValid Strikes: Points will not be awarded for touches with the sword, but must be delivered with sufficient intent and not excessive force. With the exception of the groin: ALL AREAS ON THE BODY ARE CONSIDERED VALID TARGETS. This includes, hands, fingers, and feet.\r\n\r\nCuts: For a cut to be considered valid it must have martial intent and force.\r\n\r\nThrusts: Thrusts must be delivered in a committed manner, rather than pokes which make superficial contact. A sword bend is not required, but if the sword is at full extension and makes minimal contact, then the thrust is not valid.\r\nSlices: Slices to a target must use the majority of the blade edge in friction, and should affect the structure of the opponent. \r\n\r\nAfterblows\r\nIf after the initial blow lands, the opponent also lands a substantial strike in tempo (the attack must have been launched within the tempo of the first strike\u00e2\u0080\u0099s period between initiation and contact) one point will be deducted from the score awarded.\r\n\r\nSimultaneous Contact\r\nIf the director and judges cannot reasonably discern which strike landed first, no point will be awarded. After two such instances within a bout, 1 point will be deducted from each fighter for each subsequent simultaneous strike down to 0 points. If one fighter reaches 0, no points will be deducted from either fighter.\r\n\r\nIf 5 double hits occur who ever has the most points at the time takes the match. In the result of a tie after those double hits, the next point wins.\r\n\r\nGrappling\r\nAny direct physical control of the opponent will be limited to use of the hands and arms to isolate and control the opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weapon or arms. No greater than 3 seconds of grappling will be allowed prior to a call for hold and separation without point awarded.\r\n\r\nDisarms\r\nIf a fighter is disarmed, the armed opponent may demonstrate a light, controlled strike for a point. Excessive force applied will be deemed an uncontrolled strike.\r\nThe disarmed fighter may attempt to retrieve their blade provided that they do not expose their back to the opponent.\r\n\r\nIllegal Targets and Techniques\r\nNo point will be awarded for strikes to the groin, or back of the head and neck in regions not protected by an unsupplemented helmet.\r\n\r\nUncontrolled strikes (those deemed as flailing, unsafe, or with excessive force by the director) will not be considered substantial, and will result in a warning recorded by the director. The second uncontrolled strike within the tournament will result in a yellow card, and a third will be a red card. Any individual red carded will not be allowed to participate in the next tournament held by this organization.\r\n\r\nAny use of punches, elbows, kicks, knees, trips, takedowns, or throws, will result in an immediate red card.\r\nUnsportsmanlike verbal conduct will follow the same warning escalation as uncontrolled strikes.\r\n\r\nUnsafe body movement including rolls, slides, and dives will follow the same warning escalation as uncontrolled strikes.\r\nStrikes delivered after a hold is called or begun after an effective blow was landed upon a fighter will be considered uncontrolled strikes at the discretion of the director.\r\n\r\nRole of the Director\r\nThe director is the sole authority on awarding of points, calling actions of the bout, and dispensing warnings. At a hold, line judges and fighters may politely indicate if they believe an illegal target was struck.\r\n\r\nRole of the Line Judges\r\nTwo line judges will assist in calls by raising the color of the scoring fighter and indicating the scored target with the other hand. A baton held skyward will indicate no afterblow point deduction was seen by the judge, vs a baton held parallel to the ground will indicate that a valid afterblow was noted by the line judge.\r\nIf a simultaneous blow is noted, the batons are crossed over the chest. Both batons are held skyward in the case of an illegal blow.\r\n\r\nRole of the Table Judge(s)\r\n1 to 2 table judges will be responsible for noting the start\/stop of the clock, advancing scoring, recording any warnings or cards given, After each bout, final stats will be recorded for each fight. These judges do not have input on scoring. If time expires, the table judge will also call for a final exchange. If 10 points are reached, the table judge is to call the match.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n21 & Over Mixed Epee\r\nPreregistration opens on 05\/09\/2022.\r\nPreregistration closes on 07\/01\/2022.","venue":{"name":"Orange County Convention Center","address":"9800 International Dr, Orlando, FL 32819 \u00c2\u00b7","city":"Orlando","state":"FL","zip":"32819","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.433823,"longitude":-81.4727824,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":197266,"tournament_id":50623,"tournament":"SMC HEMA Rapier Tournament ","full_name":"21Over Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"21Over","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-07-02T18:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50516,"name":"July 4th FOIL - Y8\/Y12\/DIV2 Mixed","start_date":"2022-07-04","end_date":"","comments":"Come by PrecisionAFC on Independence Day for a tournament!

If there is an off-hand item that you would like to use that was not listed, please contact me at alexk@tampabayfencers.com\r\n    -You do not have to use an off hand weapon and you may parry with your off-hand, however, you cannot grab your opponents blade and if you chose to not have an off-hand weapon, your opponent can chose whether they can use one or two weapons. \r\n    -If you do not have a dagger or other off-hand weapon, one will be lent to you at the start of your bouts.\r\n\r\nAnother rule in the tournament is that time does NOT stop after a touch is scored, which means you shouldn't be arguing with the referee. \r\n\r\nHopefully you can come out and attend the tournament, we look forward to seeing you there! \r\n\r\nHere are the rules for each event:\r\nFoil: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1xyRH1g1LP8NaiRo1CscHQDG785JSForWEzGxHVWEjro\/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n\r\nOne touch epee: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1TZjGJkT4pMm2Ecp6SlWPLyU3Viajl1HjFcm08vA7vFI\/edit?usp=sharing\r\n\r\nEpee and Dagger: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1RmUIjtBOzwL4HcKGfC3SK8ypvheaKDYgTaLeO7meslw\/edit?usp=sharing","venue":{"name":"Tampa Bay Fencer Club","address":"15550 Spring Pine Dr, Tampa, FL 33624","city":"Tampa","state":"FL","zip":"33624","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.0928199,"longitude":-82.5078861,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194047,"tournament_id":49762,"tournament":"6th Tampa Bay Melee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dry Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"Dry","close_of_reg":"2022-07-09T13:15:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194048,"tournament_id":49762,"tournament":"6th Tampa Bay Melee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dry One Touch Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":11,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"Dry One Touch","close_of_reg":"2022-07-09T13:15:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194049,"tournament_id":49762,"tournament":"6th Tampa Bay Melee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dagger and Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"Dagger and","close_of_reg":"2022-07-09T13:45:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50840,"name":"Discounted Earn Your D!","start_date":"2022-07-10","end_date":"","comments":"E & Under 3 Weapon event. $35 per event.

If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also use electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with teams of 3 that are chosen in some fair, fun, or random way. Team captains who are the top fencers in the tournament will be separated to different teams. Fencer strength will be based on USA Fencing National Points Standing (regardless of age group), highest rating in any weapon, referee certification, and\/or shoe size. Teams will be balanced as much as possible. The rounds will be self-directed. Standard USA Fencing team rules will apply. We will fence in a team relay format (going to 45 points total).\r\n\r\nDepending on the number of teams we may be able to hold 3 rounds lasting approximately 1 hour each to fence off each position. Final format will be determined by the number of teams.\r\n\r\nABOUT TOM\r\nThomas Priester, PhD. Tom joined Metro Tacoma Fencing Club in 1999 as a successful three weapon fencer. He was one of our volunteer coaches who enjoyed working with our younger fencers and share his expertise, insights, and stories. He would routinely attend open fencing and was happy to fence anyone and everyone in the club. After his heath slowed down his fencing, he would still come to the club to eat chicken dinner, socialize, and talk to both fencers and parents. His sister wrote about him, \"My brother Tom was super kind and gentle. He had a keen intellect and a quirky sense of humor. He had great friends.\" His brother George spoke fondly of him, \"Tom was notoriuously cheap. And for him to include this club in his will shows how much it meant to him.\" Tom passed away in 2021. He was incredibly generous to Metro Tacoma Fencing Club throughout his entire life and even after he passed. We will miss this gentle soul and his presence at the club. To help celebrate his memory and spirit of community, we will plan to host an annual \"Tom Priester Friendly Team Tournament\" in which we have a chance to fence and socialize just as Tom would have done. \r\n\r\nSOCIAL PART\r\nIf you want to come and socialize with or without fencing please do. Feel free to bring your lunch (unless COVID disappears lunches and socialization will be in the outside area). Chicken dinners encouraged.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Team Foil\r\n","venue":{"name":"MTFC","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787499,"longitude":-122.482943,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194899,"tournament_id":50023,"tournament":"Tom Priester Friendly Team Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":0,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-07-16T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":50596,"name":"Flagstaff Epee Event July 2022","start_date":"2022-07-16","end_date":"","comments":"Let's do some more high-altitude fencing!","prereg_open":"2022-05-05","prereg_close":"2022-07-15","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Please join us for a day of fencing and enjoy our beautiful mountain town in the pine forest. \r\n\r\nVenue:\r\n\r\nFlagstaff Family YMCA\r\n1001 N Turquoise Drive\r\nFlagstaff, AZ 86001\r\n\r\nThe tournament will be held in the YMCA's gymnasium, a very good facility with a wood floor.\r\n\r\nTournament Registration Fee: $25 if preregistered, $35 if not preregistered.\r\n\r\nEvent Fees: \r\n \r\nFirst event:  fee included in registration fee\r\nEach additional event:  $10\r\n\r\nPayment is accepted by cash or check only.
