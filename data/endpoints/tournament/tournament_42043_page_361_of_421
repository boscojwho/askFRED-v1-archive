During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2007-2012) and Senior (2006 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nIT'S NATIONAL PIE DAY! All prizes will be delectable and flaky!\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice\/Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice\/Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it's ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior: can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact Jade Calvert at j.calvert@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"CEFC 7601 Boulevard 26, Suite 131","address":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","city":"N.

Any fencers under the age of 18 will need to have a completed waiver in hand at registration if not attending the event with a parent or legal guardian. \r\n\r\nMasks and gloves will be checked during registration. Each fencer must have an extra body cord (mask cords where necessary) and an additional weapon near the strip. All foil fencers with chest protectors must comply with the soft cover rule introduced last season. Fencers competing in multiple events on the same day should check in for all events at once.  P-Card rules will be used in situations of noncom. The organizers reserve the right to implement a cutoff no stricter than 75% promotion to DEs if above 80 fencers are in a given event. \r\n\r\nIf you are interested in refereeing, we are looking for referees for foil and saber events! Email us at ugafencing1@gmail.com with your full name and capabilities, or reach out to Elya Courtney.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty.\r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee.\r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nMIXED SENIOR FOIL: 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules.\r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design.

Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED.  $25 at the door.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $15 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2019-2020 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership. Go to http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership to join.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Chest protectors are required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.  Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2006 or earlier\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":182254,"tournament_id":46135,"tournament":"MTFC E and Under Epee","full_name":"EUnder Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"E-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":13,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-02-02T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":44344,"name":"Sundays are for Sabre","start_date":"2020-02-02","end_date":"","comments":"Unrated sabre tournament.

The armory will open at 7 am. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nBeginners tournament guide (courtesy of fencing.net): http:\/\/www.fencing.net.s3.amazonaws.com\/downloads\/BeginnerGuide-Tournament.pdf\r\n\r\nUSFA rules apply: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698385-rulebook\r\nEvents will be mixed if less than 6 fencers, but points will be awarded to men and women separately\r\nOne round of pools with 100% promotion to Direct Elimination rounds. \r\nNo fence-off for third place; Medals awarded to 3rd place. \r\nFencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc . Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\nSeeding: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. \r\nOnly ratings and points standings listed on the USFA website will be used. Check your rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing and national point standing at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings.\r\n\r\nEach event consists of two rounds (pools and direct elimination)\r\nPools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round.\r\nDirect Elimination Tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round.\r\nFor Y14 and Y12, DE bouts are 15 touch\/9-minute bouts. For Y10, DE bouts are 10-touch bouts\/6 minute bouts. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\nMedals awarded to Top 8. No fence-off for third place.\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications.\r\nPhotography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\n50 Burnett Avenue, Maplewood, NJ (use 54 Burnett Avenue for GPS\/Mapquest); Conveniently located near all major highways in NJ, NY, CT, and Pennsylvania.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
