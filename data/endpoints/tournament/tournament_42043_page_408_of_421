The objective is to provide youth (y8, y10, y12 and y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in y8, y10, y12 and\/or y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur youth cup points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCalculations\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of points (mxpnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge group     mxpnts\r\n  y8\t       50\r\n  y10\t       50\r\n  y12\t      100\r\n  y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of evntxratio:\r\n\r\nEvntxratio = nentrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((nentrs - pl + 1) \/ nentrs) x mxpnts x evntxratio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned points for Escrimeur Youth Cup series will be a sum of all points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks, venmo or zelle for payments made at the door.
