Cordele and Crisp County are the #1 watermelon-producing city and county in the state of Georgia.  The red clay soil is the secret to the production and taste that makes for a champion watermelon.  This gives Cordele its greatest claim to fame as The Watermelon Capital Of The World.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, Cordele was founded, helped by the Savannah, Americus & Montgomery and the Georgia Southern & Florida. They both crossed the diamond that is still there today. Today, the Norfolk Southern's Macon District, CSX's Fitzgerald Subdivison, the Genesee & Wyoming's owned Heart of Georgia Railroad, and the SAM. This Savannah, Americus & Montgomery is not the same one from 1888. It is rather a replica of the name, and is a tourist railroad, hosting passenger services.\r\n\r\n(A railroad) Diamond is a unique railroad structure where three different railroads: CSX, Northfork Southern, and the Heart of Georgia Railroad, intersect. This location is excellent for RailFans to watch trains.\r\n\r\nAn average of 80 trains a day cross the diamond in the south central Georgia community of Cordele, making it one of the busiest rail crossings in the Southeast.

Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2011-2014\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2007-2010\r\n\r\nAll teams may be boys, girls, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current 2021-2022 Competitive or Access members of USA Fencing. Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale or rental. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $30 per fencer. There will be medals for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=48798\r\n\r\nPre-registration closes on June 10th.","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":190196,"tournament_id":48798,"tournament":"RCFC Youth Team Tourney","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"Y10MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-06-11T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":190197,"tournament_id":48798,"tournament":"RCFC Youth Team Tourney","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"Y12MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":2,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-06-12T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":190198,"tournament_id":48798,"tournament":"RCFC Youth Team Tourney","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"Y14MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-06-11T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":48816,"name":"Saber Day: Veteran, Open, Team","start_date":"2022-06-11","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2021-09-12","prereg_close":"2022-06-11","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"<b>SABER DAY: Veteran, Open, Team<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>SCHEDULE<\/b>\r\nnoon -- Veteran Mixed Saber\r\nnoon -- Senior Mixed Saber\r\n2:30pm* -- Senior Mixed Team Saber\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n* The start of the Team event may be slightly delayed by the Individual events.\r\n\r\n<b>ENTRY<\/b>\r\nThis event is sanctioned by the Western Washington Division and ratings can be awarded.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing competitive membership is required.

He earned his Maitre de Sabre certification in 2009 from the US Fencing Coaches Association.  His certification is recognized by the 17 country members of the Acadamie d'Armes Internationale, the international fencing coaches organization. \r\n\r\nMaitre Yung has trained fencers domestic and foreign.

The organizers understand the concerns that many fencers will have regarding health and safety protocols. For this reason, the organizers have communicated an expectation to each club hosting an event that they will meet or exceed the standard set for NACs (masking at all times and proof of vaccination) in addition to complying with all local laws. While the organizers will attempt to provide updates via social media, given the speed with which policies can change, the most definitive information regarding health and safety protocols will always be found by calling the club hosting the event.\r\n\r\nHOW WILL THE CUP WINNER DETERMINED?\r\nIn addition to individual event awards, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2021-2022 Cup Standings at the end of the season will be recognized. Awards will be given after the season's final event. 2021-2022 Cup Standings will be determined as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Each fencer will get credit for points earned at up to three 2021-2022 Cup events (assuming the currently anticipated five events; if a sixth event is added, points can be earned at up to four events)\r\n\r\n2. For each 2021-2022 Cup event, fencers will receive points based on their finish and letter ratings of other participants who finish below them: \r\n\r\n   a. Each fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)\r\n   b. Fencers will earn points equal to the sum of the point values of all fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points\r\n   c. In the case of Vet Mixed Events, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) below them\r\n\r\n3. Ties in the Cup Standings will be resolved in favor of the fencer that received the higher number of points at a single Cup event\r\n\r\n\r\n2021-2022 TRI-STATE VETERANS SABER CUP EVENTS\r\nOctober 24, 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Lilov Fencing Academy\r\nDecember 12, 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manhattan Fencing Center\r\nJanuary 30, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sheridan Fencing Academy (Manhattan location)\r\nApril 24, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sheridan Fencing Academy (White Plains \/ Westchester County location)\r\nJune 12, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Infinity Fencing Alliance\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nInfinity Fencing Alliance is a 3,300 sq ft facility with wooden floors, 7 FIE size regulation strips with state-of-the-art VSM computerized scoring machines and free Wifi.

Per USFA fencers may opt to wear surgical mask or not under their masks. Otherwise, masks are still required by everyone else. If you are unable to wear a mask do not register.

When the tournament is uploaded to the event computer, your information will be updated to what is currently in the USFA database. \r\n\r\nAll other questions please contact:\r\n\r\nmerritt55@comcast.net\r\n\r\nI recommend you read all current info below.\r\n\r\nLIVE RESULTS WILL BE ON FENCINGTIMELIVE.COM\r\n\r\nPOMME DE TERRE INDIVIDUAL\r\nBILL HALL VETERAN EVENTS\r\n\r\nNew England Division USFA (NEUSFA) will hold the 33rd Annual Pomme de Terre fencing tournament at Brandeis University on June 18 & June 19, 2022.\r\n\r\nThere is no team event, so please don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t email and ask for one. \r\n\r\nPLEASE READ BELOW FOR FAQs and IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR FOREIGN FENCERS.\r\n\r\n1. NO EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE FOR LATE ENTRY. Please, DO NOT email me with your reason for not registering on time. The answer will not be any different than what is stated here. Your inability to register on time is not my problem. Register early to avoid any issues. Registration without complete payment does not mean you are entered. Register and pay before the state deadlines.\r\n\r\n2. NO WALKINS WILL BE ALLOWED - only preregistered and PAID competitors may fence. \r\n\r\n3. US fencers - you must be current ACCESS or COMPETITIVE MEMBERS of USFA. There are no day memberships and noncompetitive memberships are ineligible. Collegiate members MUST be on their college\/university official roster. \r\n\r\n4 FOREIGN athletes. We welcome your participation at the PdT; however, you must be a current member of USFA to compete. Please go to the usafencing.org website\/membership to obtain your foreign USFA membership. This includes our friends from Canada. \r\n\r\n5. Any FOREIGN national with a world ranking within the last 5 years, at any level, is not allowed to fence in the E and under. No entries will be refunded for any ineligible fencer registering for this event. We will take your money and not give it back.\r\n\r\n6. National point standings DO NOT APPLY at this tournament. If you are underage, you may not participate. See eligibility below.  \r\n\r\n7. BLUE GAUNTLET will be on site for equipment needs. \r\n\r\n8. Medals and potato specific prizes (PSPs) are awarded to top 8 in individual events. If you are unable to stay for the award presentation, you must have someone pick up the medal. No awards will be given out before the presentation. If you were fencing for the gold, you would be staying so respect your fellow athletes and stay for the presentation.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: Vet and E and Under are 100% promotion from pools to Direct Elimination. Opens are 80% promotion from pools to Direct Elimination. Seeding is by classification only; national point standings are not used. \r\nCurrently, there are no capacity limits; however, if the event is forced to relocate to Boston Fencing Club limits may be put in place for some events. \r\n\r\nREMINDER: Event Restrictions: You may fence in only one individual event per day (exception if also qualified for a Vet event). If you are in two events on the same day, (Vet and individual) you MUST present yourself at the appropriate strip when called. If you register for multiple events on the same day (i.e., different weapons) you will be removed from one and there will be no refund. \r\n\r\nELIGIBILITY\r\n\r\nBirth year 2008 or earlier. In any tournament where children can fence with adults, the fencer must be 13 BEFORE January 1 of the competition season (August - July) i.e., competitor must have turned 13 by Dec 31, 2021.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be a current access or competitive member of the USFA by June 15. Memberships will be checked before the event; if you are not compliant you will receive an email requiring you to join\/renew and bring proof of current membership. No event will be held up because you are not a USFA member at check in. We will not check membership on the day of event. Be a current member by Friday afternoon, day before event starts. \r\n\r\nCheck in WILL require current USA fencing membership card to be scanned. Printed copy is best option. You can print out your membership card from your USFA profile. Phones do not always work, and you will hold up the line for other competitors. \r\n \r\nCOST\r\nIndividual Events\r\n\r\nEarly Registration Period has closed\r\nEntry Fee Discount per fencer \r\nFeb 1 - Feb 28\r\nRegistration $35.00\r\nEntry $45.00 per event\r\n\r\nRegular Registration\/Entry Fee\r\nMarch 1 - May 14\r\nRegistration $45.00\r\nEntry Fee $55.00 per event\r\n\r\nLate Registration\/Entry Fee\r\nMay 15 - May 21\r\nRegistration $90.00\r\nEntry Fee $110.00 per event\r\n\r\nTriple Entry Fees (per event)\r\nMay 22 - June 4\r\nRegistration $135.00 \r\nEntry Fee $165.00 per event \r\n\r\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT ABOVE \u00e2\u0080\u0093 NO LATE ENTRIES OR WALKINS WILL BE ACCEPTED.
