If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/11\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/08\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":62357,"tournament_id":14488,"tournament":"Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12963,"name":"Spring Sabre Fling","start_date":"2011-04-10","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-09-17","prereg_close":"2011-04-09","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Hillel School","address":"19000 N.E. 25th Ave.","city":"North Miami Beach","state":"FL","zip":"33180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":25.96031,"longitude":-80.141939,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":54869,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"U19 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U19MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54870,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54871,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54872,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54873,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54874,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54875,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"Junior Mixed Epee","short_name":"JrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":54876,"tournament_id":12963,"tournament":"Spring Sabre Fling","full_name":"Mixed Team Saber","short_name":"MxSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-10T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12989,"name":"Orange Coast Division 3 Weapon Open","start_date":"2011-04-10","end_date":"","comments":"Everyone is invited to this three-weapon mixed open tournament.","prereg_open":"2011-03-09","prereg_close":"2011-04-09","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"The entry fee is $10.00 for each event payable at the door.\r\nWe are accepting pre-registration for this tournament, but not required.\r\n\r\n 9:00 am - Open Mixed Foil\r\n12:00 pm - Open Mixed Epee\r\n 2:00 pm - Open Mixed Sabre\r\n\r\n1.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/24\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/15\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":62358,"tournament_id":14489,"tournament":"Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-04-17T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12187,"name":"Maryland FC April Practice Tournament","start_date":"2011-04-17","end_date":"","comments":"Practice tournament for MDFC only. $10 entry if you pre-register here, $20 entry if you are not pre-registered by 4\/15.
