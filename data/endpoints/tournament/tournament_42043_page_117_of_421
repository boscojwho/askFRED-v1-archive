IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB.\r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park. On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $6.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.\r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map.\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc@gmail.com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":60590,"tournament_id":14049,"tournament":"Intercollegiate Tournament 2011","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-02-27T12:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":60591,"tournament_id":14049,"tournament":"Intercollegiate Tournament 2011","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-02-27T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14060,"name":"CFC \/ TWC Mixed Epee C","start_date":"2011-02-27","end_date":"","comments":"Mixed Epee C.

The events will alternate between foil and epee.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments are designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer. There are four tournaments per weapon. There will be a point system for Epee and Foil. Awards will be given to the top three fencers in the points standings at the last tournaments (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). The points system is described below.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events. Tournament cost is $10.00 if you preregister on AskFRED. $15.00 to register at the door.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1) Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments. Awards will be given out at the last tournament of each weapon (Senior Circuit #7 & #8).

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n  \r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60403,"tournament_id":14010,"tournament":"Y12 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-03-05T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13000,"name":"Miami Madness 2011","start_date":"2011-03-05","end_date":"2011-03-06","comments":"Join us for two days of great fencing!

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60404,"tournament_id":14011,"tournament":"Div. 3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-03-06T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11976,"name":"Avant-Garde Saber Cup # 3","start_date":"2011-03-06","end_date":"","comments":"Please join us for a third tournamnet in a circuit of 4 tournaments hosted by AGFC in the 2010-2011 season.
