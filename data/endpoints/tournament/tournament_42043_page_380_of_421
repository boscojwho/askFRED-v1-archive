Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\nScreaming\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u008b\r\nHandshakes\r\n\r\nAthletes are to salute at the conclusion of a bout in lieu of shaking hands with each other, the referee or coaches.\r\n\r\nSpectator\/Coach Policy\r\n\r\nEach fencer may have ONE adult (parent or coach), on the gym with them.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"True North Classical Academy Gymnasium","address":"9393 Sunset Dr","city":"Miami","state":"FL","zip":"33173","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":25.7026906,"longitude":-80.3458533,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":187616,"tournament_id":48017,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Championship","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":187617,"tournament_id":48017,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Championship","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":187618,"tournament_id":48017,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Championship","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":187619,"tournament_id":48017,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Championship","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":0,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":187620,"tournament_id":48017,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Championship","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":0,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":48298,"name":"Kaizen Shooting Stars Epee Tournament","start_date":"2021-06-12","end_date":"","comments":"Come have some fun!","prereg_open":"2021-06-05","prereg_close":"2021-06-11","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"FRED Announces the Kaizen Shooting Stars Tournament\r\n\r\nGet ready for Summer Nationals! \r\n\r\nAll competitors need a USA Fencing membership.\r\n- Knickers\r\n- Plastron\r\n- Hard chest protectors (compulsory for women)\r\n- Long socks\r\n\r\nFeel free to hang out and playboard games after your tournament. \r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info: -------------------\r\nTournament: Kaizen Academy Shooting Stars \r\nDate(s): 6\/12\/2021\r\nLocation: Kaizen Academy LLC, 9620 153rd Ave NE, #A5, Redmond, WA 98052\r\n\r\nEvent | Date  | Registration Closes\r\n\r\nMixed Epee | Sat 6\/12 |  2:00 PM\r\n\r\nCost: $30\/event\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=48298\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/11\/2021\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

We welcome all Central Florida Division Youth Fencers to join us in this event!  \r\n\r\n<b>Points:<\/b>\r\nThe best 2 results count towards the point total. DYCS points are not used in any National Point Standings, for seeding or team selection purposes. Using the formula below, DYCS tournaments will award points to all participants: (# entries \u00e2\u0080\u0093 place + 1) \/# entries) x 100 points When there is a mixed gender Youth competition, points are not separated out by gender. The winner of each DYCS, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event. RYC. At least 5 fencers must compete in a given DYCS event for points to be awarded.\r\n\r\nExample:  \r\nFencer places 6th out of a field of 14 fencers = 64 points\r\n(14-6+1)\/14 x 100\r\n9\/14 x 100\r\n.64 x 100\r\n64  \r\n\r\nFencer places 6th out of a field of 8 fencers = 38 points\r\n(8-6+1)\/8 x 100\r\n3\/8 x 100\r\n38 x 100\r\n38\r\n\r\nFencers may fence in multiple events as long as the events do not overlap.

After the close of regular registration, Registration fees will no longer be refunded, just event fees.  At the close of <b>Late Registration, no refunds will be awarded.<\/b>\r\nFencers need to arrive prior to the close of check in.  Due to the pandemic and the necessity to start our events on time, we will not be able to hold an event for any fencer or allow late entries.  Any fencer that has not checked in prior to the posted time of the close of check in will be disqualified from that event.  \r\nRegistration will be through the AskFRED.net website and all funds will be collected at that time.\r\n\r\n<b>Schedule<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe schedule for the DYCS is subject to change.  Scheduling for future events will be based on the turnout in previous events and early registration.  The final schedule will be set AT LEAST 2 WEEKS BEFORE THE EVENT START DATE.  We will also email all effected participants with any schedule changes, so please be sure that an updated and accurate email address is attached to your AskFRED profile.\r\n\r\n<b>Equipment Check:<\/b>\r\nAt each event, please be prepared to present the following equipment at equipment check for inspection:\r\nMask\r\nGlove\r\n2 Body Cords\r\n2 Mask Cords (Foil\/Saber)\r\nLame (Foil\/Saber)\r\n\r\n<b>Uniform:<\/b>\r\nAll fencers must be in USA Fencing Compliant Uniforms.  Full fencing attire is required, including conductive foil bibs, fencing pants and socks that meet the knee, plastron (half jacket) and chest protector with appropriate FIE cover.  If you show up without the required equipment you will not be permitted to fence!\r\n\r\n<b>USA FENCING GUIDELINES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY:\r\n\r\nMask Mandate<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll attendees at USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments will be required to wear a mask at all times, including athletes during competition. Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\n<b>Screaming<\/b>\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n<b>Handshakes<\/b>\r\n\r\nAthletes are to salute at the conclusion of a bout in lieu of shaking hands with each other, the referee or coaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/18\/2021.\r\nLate Registration Begins 06\/04\/2021.\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/10\/2021.","venue":{"name":"Stoccata Fencing Academy and Club","address":"360 N State Road 434","city":"Altamonte Springs","state":"FL","zip":"32750","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.6667501,"longitude":-81.4198828,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":185893,"tournament_id":47579,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T09:45:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185894,"tournament_id":47579,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #3","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":11,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T08:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185896,"tournament_id":47579,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185897,"tournament_id":47579,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #3","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":11,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185899,"tournament_id":47579,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185900,"tournament_id":47579,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #3","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-06-12T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":47583,"name":"BODYARMOR State Games","start_date":"2021-06-12","end_date":"2021-06-13","comments":"Official registration is at https:\/\/ncsports.org\/event\/sg_fencing\/","prereg_open":"2021-02-18","prereg_close":"2021-06-06","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Live Results available online at - \r\nhttps:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\r\n\r\nHealth and Safety Guidelines available at - \r\nhttps:\/\/ncsports.org\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/03\/BASG-Health-and-Safety-Guidelines-FN.pdf\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION SITE: Apex Fencing Academy\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION DATE: June 12-13, 2021\r\n\r\nONLINE ENTRY FEE: \r\nOpen Events: $45 for first event; $15 for each additional event\r\nY12 Events: $25 for first event; $10 for each additional event\r\n\r\nENTRY DEADLINES AND FEES: Online registration will close at 11:59 PM on June 6th.

Tournament organizer reserves the right to refuse entry to anyone coming from one of these areas. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Wash and sanitize all your fencing equipment. Consult the manufacturer for proper cleaning instructions to avoid possible damage to equipment. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Fencers should come to the tournament already dressed in freshly washed fencing uniform.

Mask must cover nose and mouth. There is no exception to this requirement. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Everyone must practice social distancing. \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Guardians must remain in designated seating areas off the fencing floor.

It is open to any fencer with a USA Fencing membership born in 2007 or earlier.\r\n\r\nWe greatly appreciate your support!\r\n\r\nP.S. Rumor has it that Coach Chung himself may be coming to compete!\r\n\r\nCOVID Compliance:  Event is capped at 30 total fencers. \r\n All fencers must register upon arrival and certify that they and their parent answer negative to the COVID screening questions. Fencers and their parent will have their temperature screened upon arrival. Any fencer or guest who has been exposed to COVID or is feeling ill should stay home. \r\n\r\nFencers and their parent must wear a USA fencing approved mask at all times while at the tournament both inside and outside. The only exception is that fencers may lower their mask for a water break while stationary and at least 6 feet from others. Per USA Fencing, face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and inserts that clip into the fencing mask and do not fully contact the athlete's face are not permitted. Fencers and parents who arrive without an approved mask will be offered a surgical mask. \r\n\r\nAfter screening, fencers will be assigned their pool and directed to a colored floor marker in their pool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designated waiting area. If it is raining, this waiting area will be covered. Fencers and their guest must maintain 6 feet of distance from other fencers in the waiting area. A facility map with designated waiting areas and doors will be available. Sanitizing stations will be available at each pool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waiting area.  Seating will be limited so please consider bringing your own camping chair.\r\n\r\nFencers should bring prefilled water bottles for the tournament. There will not be water bottle filling stations. There will be no eating inside the tournament area (indoors or outdoors) and masks may be removed for water breaks only when stationary and maintaining 6 feet of distancing. \r\n\r\nCome dressed to compete. There will be no changing area. Gear bags will remain in the waiting areas with fencers bringing only their back up blades and water bottles with them inside. \r\n\r\nReferees will call fencers one at a time inside to fence their bouts. All fencers should enter and exit the building through their assigned door only and only at the direction of their referee. Fencers may have their parent accompany them inside and observe their bout and take pictures from the marked viewing spots. \r\n\r\nReferees will be responsible for enforcing mask compliance. Referees will offer tape or a surgical mask for the first infraction. The second violation is a yellow card. The third infraction is a red card and the fourth infraction is a black card with the fencer being disqualified and asked to leave the tournament immediately. \r\n\r\nThe awards ceremony will be brief and held outdoors for safety.\r\n\r\nA designated COVid Supervisor will be present at the tournament to ensure compliance with safety policies. Please feel free to speak with them if you have concerns or questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event.

US Fencing Association membership required.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info -------------------\r\n\r\nTournament: MTFC Senior Mixed Epee\r\nDate: June 20, 2021\r\nClose of Registration: 9 AM\r\nLocation: Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Lakewood, WA\r\n\r\nWe are physically located at 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499, right next to the Olympus Spa and across the street from H Mart. There are a number of food options near our club.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 9AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $50 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED.  $25 discount for anyone who has a valid COVID Vaccination Card (first shot only still counts).  ALL proceeds go to the MTFC Financial Aid Fund which provides access to fencing to all community members, no matter their financial situation.  \r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $15 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.  (no charge to MTFC Members to borrow club gear).  \r\n\r\nCOVID Compliance:  Event is capped at 30 total fencers. \r\n All fencers must register upon arrival and certify that they and their parent answer negative to the COVID screening questions. Fencers and their parent will have their temperature screened upon arrival. Any fencer or guest who has been exposed to COVID or is feeling ill should stay home. \r\n\r\nFencers and their parent must wear a USA fencing approved mask at all times while at the tournament both inside and outside. The only exception is that fencers may lower their mask for a water break while stationary and at least 6 feet from others. Per USA Fencing, face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and inserts that clip into the fencing mask and do not fully contact the athlete's face are not permitted. Fencers and parents who arrive without an approved mask will be offered a surgical mask. \r\n\r\nAfter screening, fencers will be assigned their pool and directed to a colored floor marker in their pool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designated waiting area. If it is raining, this waiting area will be covered. Fencers and their guest must maintain 6 feet of distance from other fencers in the waiting area. A facility map with designated waiting areas and doors will be available. Sanitizing stations will be available at each pool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waiting area.  Seating will be limited so please consider bringing your own camping chair.\r\n\r\nFencers should bring prefilled water bottles for the tournament. There will not be water bottle filling stations. There will be no eating inside the tournament area (indoors or outdoors) and masks may be removed for water breaks only when stationary and maintaining 6 feet of distancing. \r\n\r\nCome dressed to compete. There will be no changing area. Gear bags will remain in the waiting areas with fencers bringing only their back up blades and water bottles with them inside. \r\n\r\nReferees will call fencers one at a time inside to fence their bouts. All fencers should enter and exit the building through their assigned door only and only at the direction of their referee. Fencers may have their parent accompany them inside and observe their bout and take pictures from the marked viewing spots. Please remember to thank your referee. They are all MTFC students who are either certified or have taken the refereeing course.\r\n\r\nReferees will be responsible for enforcing mask compliance. Referees will offer tape or a surgical mask for the first infraction. The second violation is a yellow card. The third infraction is a red card and the fourth infraction is a black card with the fencer being disqualified and asked to leave the tournament immediately. \r\n\r\nThe awards ceremony will be brief and held outdoors for safety.\r\n\r\nA designated COVid Supervisor will be present at the tournament to ensure compliance with safety policies. Please feel free to speak with them if you have concerns or questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2020-2021 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership.

Cordele and Crisp County are the #1 watermelon-producing city and county in the state of Georgia.  The red clay soil is the secret to the production and taste that makes for a champion watermelon.  This gives Cordele its greatest claim to fame as The Watermelon Capital Of The World.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, Cordele was founded, helped by the Savannah, Americus & Montgomery and the Georgia Southern & Florida. They both crossed the diamond that is still there today. Today, the Norfolk Southern's Macon District, CSX's Fitzgerald Subdivison, the Genesee & Wyoming's owned Heart of Georgia Railroad, and the SAM. This Savannah, Americus & Montgomery is not the same one from 1888. It is rather a replica of the name, and is a tourist railroad, hosting passenger services.\r\n\r\n(A railroad) Diamond is a unique railroad structure where three different railroads: CSX, Northfork Southern, and the Heart of Georgia Railroad, intersect. This location is excellent for RailFans to watch trains.\r\n\r\nAn average of 80 trains a day cross the diamond in the south central Georgia community of Cordele, making it one of the busiest rail crossings in the Southeast. Norfolk Southern, CSX Transportation, and the Heart of Georgia Railroad, a Genesee & Wyoming short line, all use the crossing. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe activity rivals that of Folkston and Manchester, Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u009d says avid railfan and private car owner Nelson McGahee.  Todd Tait of GS&F T-TRAK, an informal regional modeling group, adds: \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the best place in the Southeast to watch trains from multiple railroads with plenty of southern hospitality.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe railroads were \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and still are  \u00e2\u0080\u0094 what makes Cordele different,\u00e2\u0080\u009d explains Monica Mitchell, the director of Cordele Main Street, a downtown promotional group. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why Cordele exists.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n\r\nTwo major railroads \u00e2\u0080\u0094the Savannah, Americus & Montgomery and Georgia Southern & Florid \u00e2\u0080\u0094 drove local economic development, so much so that the town was named for Cordelia Hawkins, daughter of the president of the SAM.\r\n\r\n<b>Schedule of Events<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Friday, June 25, 2021<\/B>\r\n\r\n7:45 p.m. Seminar:  \u00e2\u0080\u009cProven strategies and methods for the parent.

This way if a ref takes a break there is a sub. If we need to double strip there is a sub. If a ref calls in sick we have coverage.  You get the idea.\r\n\r\n2) Women's epee event has been moved up to 8:30 am BEFORE the men's event. We will double strip the women's pools. \r\n\r\nCovid plan https:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/covid\/\r\n\r\n$55 via Venmo, Zelle or Credit Card:\r\nhttps:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/cart\/\r\n\r\nBragging rights with a bonus is your reward. Earn renew or your \"A\" here and you fence for free from now on. Former scholarship winners have included Ian Sanders (2x champion), Nowell Gibson (1x champion), Tony Whelan (1x champion), Maximo Zafft, Ethan Insler, David Pavlenishvili, Gabriel Fienberg, RICUTA Laurentiu Florentin, BHATNAGAR Ayan, Gordon Reis, CENTENO Dante. Join their ranks if you have what it takes and bask in the glory.  \r\n\r\nMask up- face masks required at all times as of this date but this may change by the time June 27 rolls around. \r\n\r\nWe will flight pools once in order to accommodate larger numbers of people.  \u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere is what you need to know about flighting pools and staggering registration times. READ THIS:\r\n\r\n1) You must pay in full, in advance, or you will be scratched 48 hours prior to the start of the event (refunds only given with 48 hour advance notice). Further you must make sure your email is correct in askfred so I can communicate with you through their system.\u00c2\u00a0Pay here now, please. \r\n https:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/cart\/\r\n\r\n2) We will balance the \"heats\" and pools taking into consideration ratings, matching clubs and siblings or car pools traveling together. We are not obligated, nor promise to give you a favorable later start time.\u00c2\u00a0 Please don't ask me.... I know many of you are coming from afar and want a later start time. The priority must and will always be fair and equitable pools.\u00c2\u00a0Speaking of which we have created a talented and impartial committee responsible for creating and balancing pools. It's not just me slapping this thing together and hoping for the best.  \r\n\r\n3) If you are siblings or car pooling you MUST notify me of such so I do not split you up into separate heats. This is a courtesy that I am willing to do but again no promises of a later start time only that you will be able to arrive at the same time. Use email to notify me. \u00c2\u00a0Mikem@wayofthesword.org or info@wayofthesword.org. If you fail to notify me you may have two fencers starting at different times. \r\n\r\n4) It is imperative that you show up to the event and fence because the pools will be generated in advance (a risky move for us to manage because not showing up impacts the pool balance). As such you must be aware and with total\u00c2\u00a0 transparency that I reserve the right to manipulate the pools while maintaining balance as needed. \r\n\r\n5) \"How will you pull this off? Show me the math?\"\r\nAs many of you already know we have a large facility 11,000 sq feet on two levels. \u00c2\u00a0We have the OPTION to run 6 strips if need\u00c2\u00a0be and we will be staffing accordingly with extra ref's who are getting paid $250 to $300 a day. Here is the bad news. \u00c2\u00a0If we run 6 strips that means no parents or coaches will be permitted on the floor during the pools rounds. Let me repeat that....in order to stay within current covid capacity rules we can run 6 strips (36 fencers) safely plus staff which leaves us no room for parents or coaches during the pools. Pools should take 1.5 hrs but I would plan for 2 hrs to be on the safe side.\u00c2\u00a0We ask parents and fencers in the first heat to leave and enjoy picturesque Ridgefield's shops, restaurants and museums. You can follow the action on Fencing Time Live website as we progress.  \r\n\r\n6) \"What about the DE rounds?\" \u00c2\u00a0Glad you asked.\r\nIn the round of 64, ONLY fencers and coaches will be permitted when your time is called (fencers must leave immediately\u00c2\u00a0after the bout and may return when called for the next round). \r\n\r\nIn the round of 32, fencers and coaches will be permitted when your time is called (fencers must leave immediately\u00c2\u00a0after the bout and may return when called for the next round.\r\n\r\nIn the round of 16 onward...fencers, coaches, parents, teamates etc... (you do not have to leave the room)\r\n\r\nMedals awarded\u00c2\u00a0to the top 8\r\n\r\n7) We will be leveraging Fencing Time Live (https:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\/) to communicate start times, and strips for both pools and DE's.\u00c2\u00a0If you were not aware, in fencing time live you can see your exact start time and strip assignment for each DE round on the tableau page. We will be posting DE bouts in 15 minutes intervals, give or take a\u00c2\u00a0few minutes each way.

Fencers and their parent will have their temperature screened upon arrival. Any fencer or guest who has been exposed to COVID or is feeling ill should stay home. \r\n\r\nFencers and their parent must wear a USA fencing approved mask at all times while at the tournament both inside and outside. The only exception is that fencers may lower their mask for a water break while stationary and at least 6 feet from others. Per USA Fencing, face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and inserts that clip into the fencing mask and do not fully contact the athlete's face are not permitted. Fencers and parents who arrive without an approved mask will be offered a surgical mask. \r\n\r\nAfter screening, fencers will be assigned their pool and directed to a colored floor marker in their pool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s designated waiting area. If it is raining, this waiting area will be covered. Fencers and their guest must maintain 6 feet of distance from other fencers in the waiting area. A facility map with designated waiting areas and doors will be available. Sanitizing stations will be available at each pool\u00e2\u0080\u0099s waiting area.  Seating will be limited so please consider bringing your own camping chair.\r\n\r\nFencers should bring prefilled water bottles for the tournament. There will not be water bottle filling stations. There will be no eating inside the tournament area (indoors or outdoors) and masks may be removed for water breaks only when stationary and maintaining 6 feet of distancing. \r\n\r\nCome dressed to compete. There will be no changing area. Gear bags will remain in the waiting areas with fencers bringing only their back up blades and water bottles with them inside. \r\n\r\nReferees will call fencers one at a time inside to fence their bouts. All fencers should enter and exit the building through their assigned door only and only at the direction of their referee. Fencers may have their parent accompany them inside and observe their bout and take pictures from the marked viewing spots. Please remember to thank your referee. They are all MTFC students who are either certified or have taken the refereeing course.\r\n\r\nReferees will be responsible for enforcing mask compliance. Referees will offer tape or a surgical mask for the first infraction. The second violation is a yellow card. The third infraction is a red card and the fourth infraction is a black card with the fencer being disqualified and asked to leave the tournament immediately. \r\n\r\nThe awards ceremony will be brief and held outdoors for safety.\r\n\r\nA designated COVid Supervisor will be present at the tournament to ensure compliance with safety policies. Please feel free to speak with them if you have concerns or questions.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations.
