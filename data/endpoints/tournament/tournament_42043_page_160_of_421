Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"180 Central Park South","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7666599,"longitude":-73.9785283,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82014,"tournament_id":19886,"tournament":"NYAC Junior Sabre","full_name":"U19 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U19MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-09-22T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":19672,"name":"Foils on Cherry Street","start_date":"2012-09-22","end_date":"","comments":"Help us celebrate the opening of Academie Lafayette's new Cherry Street campus.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82395,"tournament_id":19982,"tournament":"FAP Unclassifed Sabre","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-09-23T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19989,"name":"Silicon Valley Fencing In-House Tournament","start_date":"2012-09-23","end_date":"","comments":"This is in-house tournament for Silicon Valley Fencing members only!","prereg_open":"2012-09-17","prereg_close":"2012-09-22","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Silicon Valley Fencing Center (SVF)","address":"4500 El Camino Real Ave","city":"Los Altos","state":"CA","zip":"94022","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.401631,"longitude":-122.115226,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82412,"tournament_id":19989,"tournament":"Silicon Valley Fencing In-House Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-09-23T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":82413,"tournament_id":19989,"tournament":"Silicon Valley Fencing In-House Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":14,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-09-23T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":82414,"tournament_id":19989,"tournament":"Silicon Valley Fencing In-House Tournament","full_name":"Senior Mixed 14 and above Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"14 and above","close_of_reg":"2012-09-23T15:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19505,"name":"BCAF M \/ W Foil Open","start_date":"2012-09-23","end_date":"","comments":"$35\/event for pre-registration on AskFRED by 9\/19\/12.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"180 Central Park South","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7666599,"longitude":-73.9785283,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82062,"tournament_id":19898,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #1 (Epee)","full_name":"BAbove Mixed Epee","short_name":"B+MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":27,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-09-23T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":19137,"name":"Liberty FC - Open Foil & Epee","start_date":"2012-09-23","end_date":"","comments":"Events officially sanctioned by Philadelphia Division of USFA.

Because of the amount of no-call or no shows, it's difficult to compensate Directors who are confirmed in advance. To help promote the pre-payment option, we have reduced our rate to $20 if you use the pre-payment method.  Pre-payment is NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-TRANSFERABLE.  If you are not sure if you can make it, just pre-register without pre-pay.  You can always go back into your AskFred Account and pre-pay up until the cut-off date. AskFred charges an extra $0.99 fee.  \r\n\r\n*For those who pre-register, please UN-REGISTER yourself or email\/call us if you cannot attend our events. Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season. After the 3rd infringement, your registration will need pre-approval, and an additional fee of $10 will be collected and DONATED to the American Red Cross upon check-in.  \r\n\r\ne:

The novice event(s) format will be determined by the tournament organizers at the time of the competition. \r\n\r\n<b>Diversions:<\/b>\r\nHere is a list of links for things to do in Galveston on Setember 29th when you are not fencing.\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pleasurepier\/\r\n\r\n<b>Galveston Island Duck Tours:<\/b> http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/ducktours\/\r\n\r\n<b>An Evening with Joel Grey:<\/b> http:\/\/www.thegrand.com\/\r\n\r\n<b>Cat on Hot Tin Roof:<\/b> http:\/\/www.islandetc.org\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pier 21 Theater:<\/b> (Three different films: The Great Storm, Galveston-Gateway to the Gulf; and The Pirate Island of Jean Laffite) http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pier21theatre\/\r\n\r\n<b>Pirates!

Being a tourist town, Galveston hotels run the gamut. Of really nice hotels close to the venue there are two that jump out:\r\n \r\nThe Tremont House \r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSTH\/main.wnt?cid=14807\r\n \r\nThe Hotel Galvez\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSHG\/main.wnt?cid=14749\r\n \r\nBoth are \"historic\" hotels operated by Wyndham. Tremont is in the Historic Strand District. The Galvez is on the beach. Neither is quite five minutes from the venue.\r\n \r\nFurther down Seawall Blvd, facing the Gulf of Mexico are three hotels, side by side, offering different price points, as they say. All three face the sea. Most of your drive to the venue would be along Seawall Blvd. from either of these three. It can be a bit busy on a weekend, but you do have the Gulf of Mexico on the right side pretty much 90%\r\nof the way, which can make up for it. In \"high traffic times\" allow fifteen minutes to reach the venue.\r\n \r\nThe San Luis http:\/\/www.sanluisresort.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Hilton http:\/\/www.galvestonhilton.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Holiday Inn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/holidayinnresorts\/hotels\/us\/en\/galveston\/glssb\/hoteldetail\r\n \r\nOne other option that is different but might be fun is Harbor House,which is located along the Galveston Waterfront (near the cruise ship terminals and the waterfront restaurants).\r\nhttp:\/\/www.harborhousepier21.com\/ \r\n","venue":{"name":"O'Connell College Preparatory School

IMPORTANT !!!\r\nThe registration & payment deadline is 11:59pm PDT on MONDAY, September 24th.  If you miss the deadline, you will be subject to DOUBLE fees. \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register & pay online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19118\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Registration Q & A ---\r\nQ: I missed the registration deadline, can I still attend?\r\nA: Yes, but you will pay double fees.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I pre-register and pay later?\r\nA: Yes.  Pre-register on AskFRED like you normally would, but skip the payment screen.  This will add you to the list of registrants, but note that you have not yet paid.  You can pay later (before the deadline) by simply going through the registration process on AskFRED again.\r\n\r\nQ: I don't want to pre-pay until I'm certain I can attend.\r\nA: If you pre-pay and are unable to attend, we will give you a refund of your event fees.

I hate fees!\r\nA: This fee goes to Peet, who deserves every penny for his hard work creating and maintaining AskFRED.  \r\n\r\nQ: Do I need a mask with a conductive bib to fence in the foil event?\r\nA: Yes!  The USFA officially adopted the new bib for all events starting August 1, 2012.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I fence epee using a foil mask with a conductive bib?\r\nA: No!  Using a conductive bib can ground out your opponent's weapon.  It's the same reason why you can't use a saber mask in epee.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Venue Information ---\r\nThe event will be held at:\r\n\r\nSalle Auriol Seattle\r\n760 Harrison St.\r\nSeattle, WA 98109\r\n(206) 623-8357\r\n\r\nFor directions, visit http:\/\/www.salleauriol.com\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Tournament Rules ---\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.  Canadian fencers must be current CFF members.\r\n\r\nTo verify USFA membership, we will check the membership list posted on the USFA website.  If your name is not on that list, you will be required to fill out a new USFA membership form (with payment) at the venue (unless you provide proof of signing up prior to that.)\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\nFor foil events, masks must have the conductive bib.  You can NOT use foil masks in epee events.\r\n\r\nUSFA rules require that all participants were born in 1999 or earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\n--- Equipment Check ---\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82396,"tournament_id":19983,"tournament":"FAP Unclassifed Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-09-30T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":18960,"name":"Z Southern California Sabre Cup","start_date":"2012-09-30","end_date":"","comments":"Y10\/Y12\/Y14\/Senior Sabre Tournament.

There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the April and\/or July NACs.   Y14 winners qualify for Y14 at SN. <\/i>\r\n\r\nNEW THIS SEASON -- Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) will be used for RYC events.  End of season awards will go to highest ranked fencer(s) in each age group \/ gender per region.  Each of the 6 regions will maintain RRPS.   Fencers can compete out of Region but will appear only on that Region\u0092s Point List.   The YDC has mandated that one can ONLY win the Regional Award for the Region they reside in.   Up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in a given region, their best 3 results will count.  Note, Y8 age category is not included in the RRPS. \r\n\r\nRYC tournaments will award points to all participants.  See the regional guidlines for point allocations (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/RYC-Tournament-Organizer-Resources.aspx).  Allocations will depend on the number of participants and the larger the field, the higher the points earned per placement. Everyone gets points, so attending an RYC will result in every athlete earning a ranking.  Regional Rankings will be posted on askfred.net.  These points are regional and will have no influence on the NRPS. \r\n\r\n------------------------\r\nQualification Y10\/Y12 to the April and July NACs\r\n\r\n\u0095Fencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the April and July NACs.\r\n\r\nQualification Path to Nationals for Y14 from RYC\r\n\r\n\u0095Place first in the Y14 event at a current-season RYC tournament [BoD, October 2010] In mixed events, only the first place finisher is recognized as qualified.\r\n\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT ENTRY<\/b>\r\n\r\n\u0095  Events have limited entries.
