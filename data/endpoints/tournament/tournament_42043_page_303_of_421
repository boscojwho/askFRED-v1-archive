RYC serve as a qualifying regional path to the Summer National Championships.  Regional points will be awarded only to Region 3 residents at this RYC.  Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) rankings are managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings).  There are NO National Points earned at RYC events.  All athletes who fence at an RYC will earn regional points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking.  If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.  A percentage of regional point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Youth NAC and Summer National Championships.   Foreign fencers can compete at any RYC.

There are a number of food options near our club.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 11 AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED. $25 per fencer at the door. Credit card payment will incur a $2 surcharge.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $20 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear for the new season.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2017-2018 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership. Go to http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership to join.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. A foil mask with conductive bib and mask cord are required. Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2004 or earlier\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 9\/22\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787414,"longitude":-122.4830094,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":150842,"tournament_id":37974,"tournament":"MTFC C and Under Senior Mixed Foil #1","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-09-23T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":37463,"name":"Cleveland State Fall Open","start_date":"2017-09-23","end_date":"","comments":"Cleveland State Fall Open\r\nCost: $30 per event\r\n \r\nAll proceeds go to support the CSU Varsity Fencing Program.\r\n\r\nPlease note the venue is air conditioned.\r\n\r\nEvents (times are tentative):\r\nFoil: 9:00 am\r\nSaber: 11:30 am\r\nEpee:  2:30 pm","prereg_open":"2017-07-25","prereg_close":"2017-09-20","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Cleveland State Fall Open\r\nCost: $30 per event\r\n \r\nAll proceeds go to support the CSU Varsity Fencing Program.\r\n\r\nPlease note the venue is air conditioned.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Equipment check will include masks, gloves ,body cords and head cords.\r\n\r\nIf there are 25 or more fencers than awards will go to 8th place.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (maufrich@hotmail.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (maufrich@hotmail.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7663036,"longitude":-73.9792973,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151312,"tournament_id":38096,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #1 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":25,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-09-24T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":38356,"name":"September Youth SABRE at Medeo","start_date":"2017-09-24","end_date":"","comments":"Start your new season off with this great competitive opportunity!

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of three separate tournaments spread throughout the season (we changed from the previously held four tournament format), each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on the size of the tournament and where they finish, with the Grand Finale Tournament providing \"bonus\" points to competitors. \r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\nIn our first two seasons, our Grand Prizes have been brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event, along with guitar strap, stand and wall mount.\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed EpeeSenior Mixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/24\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/29\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695342,"longitude":-86.6757895,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":148461,"tournament_id":37450,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2C3","entries":65,"prereg_count":75,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-09-30T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":148462,"tournament_id":37450,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":31,"prereg_count":37,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":151549,"tournament_id":37450,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":41,"prereg_count":44,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-09-30T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":151550,"tournament_id":37450,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":25,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-01T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":38219,"name":"Gold Blade Big \"D\" Junior\/Cadet\/Y14","start_date":"2017-09-30","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2017-08-31","prereg_close":"2017-09-29","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":25,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSaturday September 30, 2017:   \r\n   2:00PM Cadet (U17) Mixed Epee\r\n   9:00AM Junior (U20) Mixed Epee\r\n   12:00PM Youth 14 Mixed Epee\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/30\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 9\/29\/2017.\r\n\r\nSanctioned by the North Texas Division as approved USFA Tournament\r\n\r\nGold Blade Fencing Center in Southlake, TX is the host.\r\n\r\nVENUE\r\n\r\nGold Blade Fencing Center\r\n500 North Kimball St., Suite 103-C\r\nSouthlake, TX 76092\r\n\r\n\r\nREFEREE CADRE AND BOUT COMMITTEE\r\nTBD\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease be sure to see close of registration times for your event(s)\r\n\r\n\r\nENTRY FEES\r\nPre-payment is not required for individual events, but heartily encouraged!  $10 discount on Registration with pre-payment before September 29, 2017 on individual events.

or later\r\nY14 = birth year 2003 or later\r\nCadet = birth year 2001 or later\r\nJunior = birth year 1998 or later\r\n\r\nTournament Structure:\r\nAll times are close of registration, fencing to commence immediately afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a stoppage at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events will be sanctioned and require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nY8, Y10 and Y12 events require a minimum of 4 fencers.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior events require a minimum of 6 fencers for sanctioning.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of fencers of each gender.\r\n\r\nFees:\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\nTournament Rules:\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\nCFF Licenses:\r\nAll participating fencers will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\nFencing Equipment:\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 9\/27\/18.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nC & Under Senior Mixed Saber\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/12\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/30\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":149949,"tournament_id":37782,"tournament":"Liberty Open and Div2 Saber","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-01T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":149950,"tournament_id":37782,"tournament":"Liberty Open and Div2 Saber","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-01T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":38552,"name":"FAB Super Sabers Youth Tournament","start_date":"2017-10-01","end_date":"","comments":"Youth Saber Events--\r\n\r\nRegister by Friday, September 29th, to pay the $20 entry fee.  \r\n\r\nFee is $30 at the door if not preregistered.
