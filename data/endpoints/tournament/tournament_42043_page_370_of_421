Masks are not required during fencing activity. I have worn my mask while giving some lessons but not for bouting, and wearing it during the activity was fine. So if fencers are more comfortable wearing a mask while drilling and doing physical activity that is an option they can elect.\r\n\r\n6.       Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.  \r\n\r\n7.       We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.   We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Pools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round. \r\nDirect Elimination Tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Open DE bouts are 15-touch bouts\/three 3-minute periods.\r\nDuring the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.  \r\n* No fence-off for third place. \r\n* Ratings can be awarded if criteria met.  View USA Fencing Classification Chart at:  https:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0132\/5185\/USA_Fencing_Classification_Reference_Chart.pdf\r\n* Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee immediately. Fencer signature on pool score sheets and DE bout slip implies accuracy. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the Bout Committee immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). Once DE round starts pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all results before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n* Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\n* Withdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n* Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n..........VENDOR\r\n\r\nThere will NOT be an equipment vendor on-site.  \r\n\r\n..........FOOD\r\n\r\nEnergy bars and drinks will be available for a nominal fee.","venue":{"name":"Forte Fencing Club","address":"200 Morris Ave","city":"Denville","state":"NJ","zip":"07834","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.9060537,"longitude":-74.4898077,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":183218,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":183219,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":183220,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":183221,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":183222,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"EUnder Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"E-SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":183223,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"EUnder Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"E-SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":183224,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"EUnder Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"E-SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":183225,"tournament_id":46387,"tournament":"Forte E+Under, Y14 Epee\/Sabre","full_name":"EUnder Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"E-SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-05T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":46720,"name":"Wednesday Open Sabre Bouting","start_date":"2020-08-05","end_date":"","comments":"Open Sabre Bouting.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2020-2021 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Conditions of our event have changed quite a bit.  We will schedule our pools to be held at our club.  The club bay door and the front doors and windows will be open with running fans to circulate air.  Canopies and chairs will be available outside to allow for more room.  Our DE bouts will be fenced OUTSIDE with the main Fitcon event at Electric park in Lehi, UT.  We will only have two strips there (under a big canopy).  Your DEs will be scheduled.  We will probably not be able to provide grounded strips under these new conditions.  Masks will be required unless the wellness conditions improve. Fitcon is a convention and although it will be presented outdoors, there will still be congregating people. Utah does have a high case rate currently.  Please let me know if you plan to withdraw from the tournament.  This helps me to better schedule and plan.\r\n\r\nFitcon may choose to cancel its event (and ours) based on the directives given through the Governor's office.  Please keep this in mind, especially if you are traveling from outside of UT.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know your plans ASAP and I will offer refunds to those participants who cannot come but who have already paid.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your support of The American Master's Cup and of USA Fencing Veterans.

Since we're offering at least two nights per week for each weapon this can save you money over the floor fee.\r\n\r\nSo if you're looking to get some bouting in, whether your club is available or not, we wanted to make this option available to people in the community, to get good bouting with cool people from various clubs in a nice setting.\r\n\r\nLinks are included for the floor fee, or the discounted associate membership option.\r\n\r\nAssociate Single Month Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DKRMZMFHQD232\r\n\r\nAssociate Three Months Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PT5P6H55MFWPN\r\n\r\nAssociate Member 3 Month Subscription Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZTSKC3QUDBRFQ\r\n\r\nFloor Fee Single Night\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RCKLX79XB7C2L\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\n\r\nSafety Measures\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for the summer camp instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks are not required during fencing activity. I have worn my mask while giving some lessons but not for bouting, and wearing it during the activity was fine. So if fencers are more comfortable wearing a mask while drilling and doing physical activity that is an option they can elect.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14. We will limit capacity in changing rooms to also maintain social distancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/17\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 07\/20\/2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Palasz","address":"1120 N Rolling Rd","city":"Catonsville","state":"MD","zip":"21228","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.2881568,"longitude":-76.7533178,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184171,"tournament_id":46785,"tournament":"Friday Open Epee Bouting","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-08-28T20:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":46770,"name":"Team Thunder Challenge ","start_date":"2020-08-29","end_date":"","comments":"Team Thunder Challenge is the first of our Team Epee tournaments.\r\n3-4 person teams.\r\nThis is not our prize money team event.\r\n$30 per fencer paid at the door.\r\n","prereg_open":"2020-08-16","prereg_close":"2020-08-28","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Team Thunder Challenge is the first of our Team Epee tournaments.\r\n3-4 person teams.\r\nThis is not our prize money team event.\r\n$30 per fencer paid at the door.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed EpeeYouth Mixed Team EpeeCadet (U16) Mixed Team Epee\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/16\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 08\/28\/2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n************************************************************\r\nPLEASE ALLOW EXTRA TIME TO CHECK INTO YOUR EVENTS ! !\r\n************************************************************\r\n\r\nFOR INFORMATION\r\nThe Local Organizing Committee for this event is the\r\nThe City of Thunder Fencing Club (OKCFC)\r\n- http:\/\/www.thunderfencing.com\r\n- Email: davidribaudo@gmail.com\r\n- Phone: 405-474-7030\r\n\r\nVENUE INFORMATION\r\nOklahoma City Fencers Club\r\nCity of Thunder Fencing\r\n24 NW 144th Circle\r\nEdmond Ok, 73013\r\n\r\n\r\nThe venue will open at one hour prior to the earliest event all days.\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENTS\r\n[Times listed are the CLOSE of Registration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n- $15 Registration Fee\r\n- $15 Per Event Fee\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTICIPANT INFORMATION\r\nParticipation is limited to fencers whose USFA membership status can be verified.
