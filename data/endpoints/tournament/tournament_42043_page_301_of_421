What are teams made up of?\r\n2 person teams\r\n\r\n2. What is the format?\r\nPools are 5 touch bouts with only one touch needed against the team, meaning not both teammates have to be \"out\" to score a touch.\r\nDEs are 5 touch bouts but both team members must be tagged.\r\n\r\n3. How does that work?\r\nIn pools, 2 people teams fence each other at the same time. Any fencer can hit the other team whether they are in front of them or crossed diagonally. Only one touch against any of the other team is needed. Double touches count as double touches.\r\nIn DEs, same rules apply, but only one person per team can be tagged out at a time unless its a double. If team A tags one person on Team B, then it will be a 2 vs 1 situation. The Team with both members still in will start at their back warning line and the single team member will move all the way up to start the touch.

passed away in good humor on March 9, 2012 at the age of 81. He was born in Grand Forks, ND on August 2, 1930. Selberg received his Maitre D'Armes from the Federation International D'Escrime in 1967. In addition to being a fencing master, Selberg was also an abstract, post-impressionist painter. He has a painting in the permanent collection at Minnesota State University Moorhead in Moorhead, MN, and also one at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. On the side of the McCormick building in downtown Fargo, ND is a restored version of his infamous sign painting of 'The Cowboy' that he originally painted in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey). Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas. A sign painter, cartoonist and an artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952, where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine of Arts degrees from San Francisco State University. Selberg taught art in San Francisco and fell in love with fencing in the early 1950's. Fencing first took root in North Dakota in 1960, when Charles moved from San Francisco, where he was the head coach at the San Francisco School of Fencing (run by John McDougall), back to Fargo, ND, where he then founded North Dakota's first fencing school, the Selberg Fencing Academy, which he operated there between 1960 and 1966. The Selberg Fencing Academy (SFA) was originally located at 54 1\/2 North 5th St. in Fargo, but was moved in 1965 to the Fargo Arena building in Island Park in Fargo. Selberg thought that fencing would do well in Fargo because of the long cold winters that forced many people there indoors for physical activity. Fencing competitions in Fargo during that time (including many dual matches between Minneapolis and Fargo) were held either at the SFA or at Moorhead State University (MSU), in MSU's large gym. Between 1960 and 1966, the North Dakota division grew to become the 4th-largest fencing division in the country, and SFA fencers won three Midwest Championships, a Chicagoland Open Championship, and finished in the Top 10 at the U.S. National Championships in Women's Foil two years in a row. In 1966, Selberg returned to San Francisco and taught fencing at the famous Halberstadt Fencer's Club, and also began his 16-year career teaching fencing at the University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College). Known affectionately as Mr. Natural among fencers at the University of California at Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, Maestro Selberg was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, his creative abilities, and his tremendous sense of humor. The fencing masters that taught Charles formed his impressive fencing lineage: German-born Eric Funke, American-born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian-born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on Charles\u0092 teaching. In 1970, Selberg was a member of the only U.S. foil team to ever win a gold medal at the World Masters Championships. Named one of the 'Great Fencing Masters in History', Charles was the author of the renowned books 'Foil' (1976) and 'Revised Foil' (1993). After retiring from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1982, Selberg moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the Selberg Fencing Academy and created an extensive series of instructional fencing videos and DVDs (http:\/\/www.selbergfencing.com). Master Selberg taught that the greatest benefits that we get from fencing are health and recreation.

Therefore, if a fencer qualifies\r\nin an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group,\r\nthey earn qualification in that category as well.\r\n\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAbout RJCC Tournaments:\r\n\r\nFrom US Fencing's Athlete Handbook (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athlete-handbook):\r\n\r\nRegional Junior\/Cadet Circuit (RJCC): The RJCCs serve as one of the\r\nqualification paths for Junior Olympic Fencing Championships and the July Challenge. There are no national points awarded at RJCC\r\ncompetitions; please refer to Chapter 3 for more information on the\r\nRegional Point structure. The Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is a ranking program designed to recognize and reward both participation and accomplishment at the RJCC Tournament level.\r\n\r\nRegional Point Standings for Youth, Cadet and Junior reflect an\r\nathlete\u0092s results at RYC and\/or RJCC tournaments within their home\r\nregion (based on division affiliation). These point standings are\r\nposted online and are updated within five business days after the\r\ntournament organizer has properly submitted results, event officials\r\nform, membership forms and paid the program service fee. For more\r\ninformation on this point system please visit \u0096\r\nwww.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/2292457-regional. These point standings\r\nare not used for seeding, only National Point Standings are used for\r\nseeding at regional tournaments.\r\n\r\nFencers only earn points at RJCCs within their home region (region is\r\nassigned based on division affiliation). The best 2 results count\r\ntowards the point total. These points may qualify Cadet and Junior\r\nfencers to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and July Challenge. Points earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of National Point Standings, for seeding or team selection purposes; they are only reflected in Regional Point\r\nStandings. Using the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants: ((#entries \u0096 place +1) \/ # entries) x 100 points The winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.  The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in\r\nthe event, regardless of the region.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2005-20010) and Senior (2004 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 24 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates for the 2017-2018 events:\r\nAugust 26, 2017\r\nOctober 28, 2017\r\nNovember 18, 2017\r\nJanuary 20, 2017\r\nMarch 3, 2018\r\nApril 14, 2018\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462291,"longitude":-97.2377284,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":149937,"tournament_id":37778,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-08-26T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":149938,"tournament_id":37778,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-08-26T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":149939,"tournament_id":37778,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":9,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-08-26T18:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":37289,"name":"The Duelist Open 20","start_date":"2017-08-26","end_date":"","comments":"Entry Fee: $30 per Event\r\n\r\nFree Parking on-site\r\n\r\nHotel Information to come","prereg_open":"2017-06-27","prereg_close":"2017-08-25","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Entry Fee: $30 per Event\r\n\r\nFree Parking on-site\r\n\r\nSpecial Duelist Open Hotel Rate at La Quinta of Canton:\r\n41211 Ford Road \/ phone: (734) 981-1808\r\n \r\nContact the hotel directly or our Group Desk at 1-800-642-4239, Option 1 and ask for the special rate for Duelist Open.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.
