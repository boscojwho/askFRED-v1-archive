Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Seeding for pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, regardless of classification, then classification\/year, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications\/ points will be randomized within each classification. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website at the time of the tournament will be used. Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list.

Fencers are seeded by their results in the pool round wherein the results of fencers in all the pools are ordered by best results to poorest results: highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received.\r\nY10 DE format: 10-touch bouts (two 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break between). The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nY12\/Y14\/Cadet DE format: 15-touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break between) During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\r\n\u0095 No fence-off for third place; Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout.

A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>Referee Clinic with Abdel Aziz\r\n=======================<\/b>\r\nCome and join us for the Referee Clinic hosted by Abdel Aziz on October 6th from 4:00PM at Center St Louis .\r\n\r\nYou will have the chance to be observed and get a rating at The Daugherty Cup SYC\/RCC that will take place at Center St. Louis, 6727 Langley Ave, St. Louis, MO 63123 on Oct 7-9, 2017.\r\n\r\n<b><I> for more info and to sign up go to https:\/\/askfred.net\/Clinics\/moreInfo.php?clinic_id=38614<\/b><\/i>\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Host Hotel\r\n=========<\/b>\r\nHoliday Inn Route 66\r\n10709 Watson Rd\r\nSt. Louis, MO\r\n63127\r\n314-821-6600\r\nCUT OFF DATE: 9\/15\/2017\r\n\r\nTo have our special rate, please follow the link below:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.ihg.com\/holidayinn\/hotels\/us\/en\/st-louis\/stlsw\/hoteldetail?qAdlt=1&qBrs=6c.hi.ex.rs.ic.cp.in.sb.cw.cv.ul.vn.ki.sp.nd.ct&qChld=0&qFRA=1&qGRM=0&qGrpCd=FAC&qIta=99801505&qPSt=0&qRRSrt=rt&qRef=df&qRms=1&qRpn=1&qRpp=20&qSHp=1&qSmP=3&qSrt=sDD&qWch=0&srb_u=1&icdv=99801505\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=37308\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/18\/2017\r\n\r\n try http:\/\/support.askfred.net\r\n\r\nThank-you for playing!","venue":{"name":"Center St. Louis","address":"6727 Langley Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","zip":"63132","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":38.5616819,"longitude":-90.3293011,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":36,"name":"St. Louis","abbrev":"STL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":147686,"tournament_id":37308,"tournament":"Daugherty Youth Cup -

Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nAll events are for fencers born in 2004 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. D & Under events are for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2017-2018) competitive members of the USFA or CFF. All fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks.

RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $60 per team. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=38359\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/06\/2017\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

We will do our best to e-mail all pre-registered fencers with information about any changes by the Friday night preceding the tournament.\r\n\r\n***Registration fees***\r\n$35 for 1 individual event \r\n$55 for 2 individual events \r\n$10 EXTRA FOR THOSE WHO REGISTER AT THE DOOR.\r\n\r\nTeam events: $45 per team\r\n\r\n***Tournament Location***\r\n\r\nLiberty Fencing Club is located at 366 Easton Road, Warrington, PA 18976, between County Line Road and Street Road (on Route 611 across the street from Target & Lowe's). Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597 or Bout Committee at 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\n***Payment information***\r\n\r\nREVISED NO-SHOW POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/12\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/07\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":149951,"tournament_id":37783,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-08T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":149952,"tournament_id":37783,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Cadet Men's Saber","short_name":"CdMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-08T12:45:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":149953,"tournament_id":37783,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Cadet Women's Saber","short_name":"CdWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-08T12:45:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":149954,"tournament_id":37783,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Team Saber","short_name":"CdMxSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-08T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":37566,"name":"Orange Coast Division 3 Weapon Open","start_date":"2017-10-08","end_date":"","comments":"This is a division sanctioned event.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

It is recommended that you do get an USA Fencing competitive license to be fully covered and also to record your results and rating \r\nhttps:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nTiradores de otros paises pueden participar si muestran su licencia Nacional o con una licencia FIE. Pero no estan cubiertos por el seguro de la Federacion de los Estados Unidos y participaran bajo su propio riesgo. Por esa razon, es muy recomedable que obtengam una Licencia Competitiva de EE.UU.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.
