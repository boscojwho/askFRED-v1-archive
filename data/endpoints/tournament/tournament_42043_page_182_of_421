SYCs are a group of events throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y14, Y12, and Y10 age categories in all six weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn national points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families. This SYC will provide an opportunity to earn national youth rolling points; additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals for Y14, Y12, and Y10 age categories. National Points will be awarded to those fencers placing in the top 40% of the competitive field regardless of where the cut occurs. Fencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net.

At the end of the series special prizes for top over all finishers.\r\n\r\nThis series of tournaments is NOT designed for fencers who have ratings or have been fencing for more than 2 years.  This IS a developmental series of tournaments for both fencers and referees. This is NOT a USFA sanctioned event and we do not enforce the regulation of weapon length if a novice fencer does not happen to or can not borrow the age appropriate weapon.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are for those just beginning to compete, learning the rules and etiquette on the fencing strip.\r\n\r\nSchedule of Events\r\n\r\nY10 Mixed Foil 1:00pm\r\nY10 Mixed Epee 1:00pm\r\n\r\nY12 Mixed Foil 3:00pm\r\nY12 Mixed Epee 3:00pm\r\n\r\nY10 Mixed Saber 4:00pm\r\nY12 Mixed Saber 2:00pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/25\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/01\/2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Boston Fencing CLub","address":"110 Clematis Ave #2","city":"Waltham","state":"MA","zip":"02452","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":42.3833412,"longitude":-71.2009476,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87269,"tournament_id":21265,"tournament":"Joe Pechinsky Memorial Youth Tournament Series 4","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-04T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":87270,"tournament_id":21265,"tournament":"Joe Pechinsky Memorial Youth Tournament Series 4","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"15.00"},{"id":87271,"tournament_id":21265,"tournament":"Joe Pechinsky Memorial Youth Tournament Series 4","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-04T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":87272,"tournament_id":21265,"tournament":"Joe Pechinsky Memorial Youth Tournament Series 4","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-04T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":87385,"tournament_id":21265,"tournament":"Joe Pechinsky Memorial Youth Tournament Series 4","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-04T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":90319,"tournament_id":21265,"tournament":"Joe Pechinsky Memorial Youth Tournament Series 4","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-05-04T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":22289,"name":"Win Mom a Shiny Medal 'D' and Under","start_date":"2013-05-04","end_date":"","comments":"Open to all fencers with a rating of 'D' or under fencers.

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence.

There will be foil events for all Youth age groups, plus Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\nNote schedule change: Y12 Foil has been moved to 2:00 PM, to allow fencers a little more time between events.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #5\r\nDate(s): 05\/05\/2013\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSunday, May 5th, 2013\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil; Y14 Epee\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $10 (plus tax) per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2012-2013 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1998-2001\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19707\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/04\/2013\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
