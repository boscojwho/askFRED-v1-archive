Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you have not obtained your USFA membership at least one week prior to the event, it is recommended you register at the event! If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\nWaiver of Liability\r\nThe El Paso Challenge or Border Texas Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed. Fencers under 18 must have a parent signature on the waiver in order to be able to fence. This waiver is attached as a PDF file. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT OFFICIALS:\r\nReferee Cadre\r\nReferee Operations Manager and FOC - Amgad Badawi\r\n\r\nTechnical Committee\r\nTechnical Committee Chair - Ed Long\r\n\r\nVendor \r\nThe Fencing Post - Saul Mandoza will be at the venue both days with a full line of equipment and will provide a full range of repair services.

Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.hangastar.com\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 1999-2002\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1997-2000\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1995-1998\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=10954\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/26\/2010\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Foil \r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/27\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41615,"tournament_id":9592,"tournament":"Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":29,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-28T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9848,"name":"Chicago Lakeshore Fencers Club Open","start_date":"2010-02-28","end_date":"","comments":"A single event is $25 with preregistration, $35 at the door.\r\n\r\nFor two events, the cost with preregistration is $35.

Awards are based on the fencer's top 3 results.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events.  Tournament cost is 10.00.  15.00 to register at the door.  Be early, peeps!\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1)  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of participants equals the number of points.  So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points.  The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older (1996 or earlier birthdate) are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.  Trophies will be given out at the last tournament of each series.  If fencers, for whatever reason, cannot attend, prizes will be held for them at the center.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Avenue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":47909,"tournament_id":11118,"tournament":"Senior Circuit #5","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-03-04T19:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12457,"name":"Yves Auriol Challenge RYC & Jr. Event","start_date":"2010-03-04","end_date":"2010-03-06","comments":"Please join The Fencing Academy of Nevada for our 2nd Annual Yves Auriol Challenge RYC and Jr Event.

Each team will have 2 foilists and 2 epeeists.  When two teams go against each other, there will be a total of 8 bouts (each foilist fences the opposing two foilists and each epeeist fences the opposing two epeeists).  The total score decides who wins the match.\r\nAlso, one person can be a foilist and an epeeist for the same team (but can not act as both foilists or both epeeists), so teams can be composed of 2, 3, or 4 people.\r\nHopefully this new event will be a success!\r\n\r\nPreregister:\r\nWe prefer that you either preregistration on this website or e-mail us that you are coming.\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/15\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/03\/2010.\r\n\r\nWaivers:  \r\nPer Iowa State University policy, all participants must fill out waivers.

right)\r\nTurn RIGHT at North Western Avenue (stop sign)\r\nGo straight at Riverview Drive (stop sign)\r\nGo straight at University Drive (stop sign)\r\n\r\nTurn RIGHT onto University Drive (Stop sign)\r\n\r\nTurn RIGHT at the first stop sign in front of the student recreation center, the center will be on your right, and the parking lot will be on your left. Parking will be free and available because it is the weekend.\r\n\r\n(To avoid confusion there are two University Drive's, the first one is a T-intersection, where you can only turn left or go straight, the second one is a 3 way intersection where you can only turn right, or go straight. So go straight at the first one and right at the second one.)\r\n\r\nIf you would like to have a better look at the facilities then you may visit this link.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.student.services.wiu.edu\/crec\/facilities\/spencerSRC.asp\r\n\r\nAlso, for a full map of the Macomb Campus, click on the link below.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wiu.edu\/about\/maps\/campus_map_lg.gif\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nA simpler batch of directions is if you are approaching from Hwy 67 (heading south on Lafayette) then simply turn RIGHT onto University Drive (it is the first stoplight after you pass the sign that says welcome to Macomb) then turn left at the first stop sign and you'll be there. (parking lot on left building on right)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions you may call the primary contact of this tournament at 847-668-2355\r\n","venue":{"name":"WIU Student Recreation Center","address":"1 University Circle","city":"Macomb","state":"IL","zip":"61455","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":40.462584,"longitude":-90.681757,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":46477,"tournament_id":10803,"tournament":"March Fencing Madness","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-03-06T11:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":46478,"tournament_id":10803,"tournament":"March Fencing Madness","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-03-06T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":46479,"tournament_id":10803,"tournament":"March Fencing Madness","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-03-06T14:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11069,"name":"2nd Annual Lake Effect Open","start_date":"2010-03-06","end_date":"2010-03-07","comments":"Join us for our 2nd Annual Lake Effect Open!

Feel free to drop off extra people and gear there before going to park!\r\n\r\nWe ask your patience in dealing with any inconvenience caused by this setup.

There will be no fence off for third place in any event. \r\n\r\nPre-register online at AskFred.net and look to see who else is coming. Payment can be made upon arrival. Pre-registration closes on March 5, 2010.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current USFA members, and will need to show proof of membership, either by card or by fax from the USFA. (Alternatively, a fencer may be a member in good standing of another National Federation or a current FIE license holder.) You may renew your USFA membership or join at the tournament. Forms will be available at the tournament, or can be downloaded from the USFA website at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org If you do not have your USFA card with you when checking in, you will be required to complete a new USFA form and pay the annual fee. The form and payment will be returned to you upon proof of USFA membership subsequent to the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers must have a parent or guardian signature (not a coach) on their USFA membership form (if renewing or joining at the tournament) and on the tournament entry form.\r\n\r\nMask checks will be performed prior to competition, and there will be weight\/shim tests for all weapons brought onto the fencing strip. You MUST wear a plastron. No sweatpants will be permitted.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules apply. At the end of each bout, fencers are required to sign pool sheets and DE slips before leaving the strip. USFA rules will be enforced throughout the competition.\r\n\r\nFor any USFA competition that is not specifically stated for a certain age category; e.g., Youth or Cadet or Junior or Veterans, the athlete must be at least 13 years old as of January 1 of the fencing season. The fencing season is the same as the membership year, August 1 through the following July 31. The only exception to this rule is that an athlete under the age of 13 on January 1 of the fencing season, who is on the Junior national point standings, will be allowed to complete in any competition as long as the athlete meets any other criteria required for that competition, e.g., holding a certain classification. The Birmingham Fencing Club will strictly enforce this rule at all tournaments\r\n\r\nPre-registration is important! This tournament is being held in a facility with room for seven strips, and it may become necessary to limit the number of entries in particular events. Pre-register online at AskFred.net and look to see who else is coming, or register by mail, email or telephone. Payment can be made upon arrival.\r\n\r\nVenue: Birmingham Fencing Club.\r\nFor driving directions, go to http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org\r\nThere are many places to eat nearby.\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble finding the venue on the day of the tournament, call (205)515-3902 or the Club (205)823-4448.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the Birmingham Fencing Club and a full schedule of our tournaments for this season, please visit our website at http:\/\/www.fencingclub.org (not all tournaments have been posted on AskFred.net)\r\n\r\nFOR REGIONAL YOUTH CIRCUIT EVENTS ONLY\r\n\r\nYouth 10 and Youth 12 fencers MUST have fenced in at least one RYC to be eligible to enter any NAC Youth Tournament or Summer Nationals in July 2009\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that there will be separate mens and womens events in each weapon and each age group. Events may be combined into one mixed event if there are fewer than 6 fencers of either gender present at the close of registration.\r\n\r\nY10 fencers must use blades that are no longer than 32.5 inches (i.e., blades that are designated a \"0\" or \"2\" under the internationally recognized lengths). Weapon length will be tested prior to competition. \r\n\r\nTournament format will be pools to five points, used to establish seeding to the direct elimination (DE). DE bouts will be conducted as they are at a NAC. For Y10 and Y12, the winner of the DE bouts is the best 2 out of 3 five-touch bouts. For Y14, the DE bouts are 15 touches (three 3-minute periods, with a 1-minute rest between periods).\r\n\r\nTo fence Y14, you must have been born in 1995-1998, unless you are on the Y12 national point standings. To fence Y12, you must have been born in 1997-2000, unless you are on the Y10 national point standings.
