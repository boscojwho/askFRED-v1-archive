Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597 or Bout Committee at 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISED 2015-16 NO-SHOW POLICY\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\nDue to the need to accurately hire referees, we are sorry, but there can be no refunds for prepayments.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228766,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":142869,"tournament_id":36033,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Foil\/Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-26T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":142870,"tournament_id":36033,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Foil\/Epee","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-26T12:15:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":142871,"tournament_id":36033,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Foil\/Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-26T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":142872,"tournament_id":36033,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Foil\/Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-26T14:15:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":36042,"name":"8th Annual Middle School Open @ Medeo","start_date":"2017-02-26","end_date":"","comments":"SABRE START CHANGED TO 10:30 AM!

A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nTo avoid bringing this documentation, USA Fencing has an age verification process.\r\nCurrent Verification Process:\r\nAn athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via\r\nemail (information@usfencing.org), mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the\r\ndatabase. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and\r\ntemporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nSEEDING:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\nSeeding should be based on the following order:\r\n\u0095 National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n\u0095 Classification and year\r\n\u0095 If athlete has neither National Points nor a weapon classification they are seeded on a random\r\nbasis with the other athletes in the same situation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will\r\nearn regional points based on placement.

A percentage of athletes will earn\r\nqualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For more information on this Regional Points formula\r\nsee the Regional Recognition Initiative Document available http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources\r\nUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional Rank\r\neach season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior\r\ntournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional\r\npoints do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an\r\nolder age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as\r\nwell. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet,\r\nhe\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events.\r\nJunior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are also only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and\r\nJunior Olympic\/National Championships. \r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will\r\nearn regional points based on placement.

There will be foil events for all age groups, plus Y12 and Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #3\r\nDate(s): 03\/04\/2017\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, March 4th, 2017\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil; Y12 Epee\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $20 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2016-2017 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2008-2011\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2002-2005\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=34837\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/03\/2017\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Horan founded the RIT Fencing Club in 2001 with the assistance of Dr. Carl Lutzer. Fencing for almost 20 years, Sean has coached students to national medals in all three weapons, as well as international sabre competitions. Passionate about a positive club community and mathematics, Sean's establishment of RITFC almost 15 years ago has allowed for countless students to discover fencing. He continues to be a friend and mentor to the club from afar, in Irvine, CA. We look forward to seeing you, at the 2nd Annual Sean T.

After starting fencing in high school, Mitch joined the BCAF as a student in the mid 1980\u0092s and had been a member of the BCAF coaching staff for over 25 years.  He was a kind and caring man who inspired his students with his infectious enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mitch was an avid Revolutionary War historian and re-enactor.  His passion for both fencing and history touched many lives in both communities and sparked a life-long interest in many young people.  \r\n \r\nWith this competition, we honor his memory.<\/b>\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 3\/1\/17. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 3\/1\/17) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

She began competing at the international level in the late 1970\u0092s. A pupil of the great Maestro Livio Di Rosa, she first participated in the World Championships in 1977, at the age of 13. She won the Italian youth title the following year, and the prestigious New York Martini Trophy.\r\n\r\nAt 16 Dorina competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics, placing 4th in individual and 5th in team. In 1981 she won the World Cup, followed a year later by her first of several European and World Championships. She continued her Olympic careers in Los Angeles (Bronze), Seoul Korea (Silver) and 1992 Barcelona (Gold). After the bronze in the World Cup team of 1993, Dorina left competition, only to return in 1998 to win the Italian title.\r\n\r\nDorina began to devote herself to competitive cycling in 2000, taking many marathon victories and winning a master Italian title in the world category.

Online fees go up to $45 on 3\/4. Why is the fee so much higher if it is paid at the door? Having fencers pay online before the tournament gives us a better idea of how many to expect. If we know how many people to expect, we can be sure to hire the correct number of qualified referees. Please help us run a better event for all our fencers and pre-pay. If you cannot pre-pay online, then please email us to confirm your attendance and receive the online price at the door.
