Please read through the information below, and contact Jeff@midsouthfencersclub.org if you have any questions.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this tournament is to promote the growth of the North Carolina HEMA community, provide greater competitive opportunities for developing fencers within our geographic area, and to facilitate the training of tournament staff. We are asking all participants to plan to assist in judging throughout the tournament. Experienced fencers and judges will be there to mentor, and the environment is going to be extremely friendly! \r\n\r\nDeveloping a cadre of skilled judges in our area is critical to the growth of HEMA competition, and the only way to do this is for everyone to participate in the process.\r\n\r\n<b> Registration <\/b>\r\nPlease pre-register via this website, payment will be made at the time of check-in. Registration will close on September 10. Askfred.net is designed for olympic style fencing events, so please disregard the \"saber\" at the end of each event title.  There will be be Women's longsword beginning at 10am and Men's longsword beginning at 1pm. Participants must be age 16 or older, minors must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Everyone must download the attached waiver and bring it at the time of check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Equipment Requirements <\/b>\r\nWe plan to follow the HEMA Alliance Safety policy for this event. Please be sure to have proper equipment including gorget and proper gloves. Lacrosse or hockey gloves without added reinforcement will not be allowed. Referees will be checking equipment at the start of pools and at the beginning of each DE. You can read the HEMA alliance safety policy here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.hemaalliance.com\/safety-policy\/\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format<\/b>\r\nFencers will be divided up into pools of between 5 and 7 fencers.  Pool round results will be compiled for all the pools and the direct elimination round seeded based on pool round results.  If we have 32 or fewer participants, we are planning for everyone to advance to DE rounds.  If there are greater than 32 participants, than the top 32 fencers out of pools will advance to the direct elimination.  Direct elimination rounds will be single elimination fenced down to a final gold medalist.  There will be a fence-off for bronze.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to allow participants to have a fair number of fights and to speed up the pool round and put more emphasis on the direct elimination rounds.  \r\n\r\n<b>Seeding<\/b>\r\nIn an effort to attempt to seed the pool rounds in a reasonable fashion, we are asking participants to submit their last 3 longsword competition results via the shared google spreadsheet available here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/1UBvacO\r\n\r\nWe plan to use the info to generate a points list used for seeding the event. The spreadsheet will close on September 10, please complete this as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n<b>Scoring Rules<\/b>\r\nPool rounds will be fought to a maximum of 10 points with a 2:00 minute clock that will stop each time the referee calls halt.  The fencer who reaches 10 points first, or has earned more points at the end of the 2:00 minute period will be the winner.\r\n\r\nDirect elimination bouts will be fought to a maximum of 15 points with a 3:00 minute clock that will stop each time the referee calls halt. The fencer who reaches 15 first or has earned more points at the end of the 3:00 minute period will be the winner.\r\n\r\nTies and double losses will not be allowed.  If the score is tied at the end of the period, one fencer will randomly be assigned priority.  The fencers will then fence a 1 minute sudden death period.  The fencer who scores first, or scores by the higher point value target will be the winner.  If at the end of the 1 minute period, the score is still tied then the fencer who was designated as having \"priority\" will be the winner.\r\n\r\n<b>Point Values, Double Hits, and After Blows<\/b>\r\nThe following point values will be used for scoring:\r\n\r\nHead 3 points\r\nBody 2 points\r\nLimbs 1 point\r\nRingout 1 point\r\nDisarm 1 point\r\nPommel Strike 1 point\r\n\r\nDouble hits will not be counted and those exchanges will be thrown out. After-blows may arrive with a maximum of 1 step after the initial blow as arrived. After-blows score as a point deduction against the attacker based on the point value of the target area that it arrives. For example, if Fencer A makes a cut to the head of Fencer B and Fencer B responds with an afterblow to the body of Fencer then Fencer A will only earn 1 point for his attack. If the after-blow arrives at the same or higher point value target, then it nullifies the attackers points and no points are awarded for the exchange.\r\n\r\nStrikes that arrive with insufficient force or arrive with the flat of the sword will not be counted and referees will not call \"point\" or \"halt\" unless clear strikes are visible. Disorganized exchanges between the competitors in which the judges cannot determine clear scoring actions will be disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Mid-South Fencers' Club","address":"125 North Gregson Street","city":"Durham","state":"NC","zip":"27701","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":36.0008843,"longitude":-78.9089981,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":59,"name":"North Carolina","abbrev":"NC","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":132408,"tournament_id":33706,"tournament":"Mid-South Fencers HEMA Longsword Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Women's  Longsword Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Women's  Longsword","close_of_reg":"2016-09-18T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":132409,"tournament_id":33706,"tournament":"Mid-South Fencers HEMA Longsword Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed   Longsword Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"  Longsword","close_of_reg":"2016-09-18T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":34733,"name":"Mixed Epee Team Mixed Foil team","start_date":"2016-09-18","end_date":"","comments":"Six teams maximum for each weapon.\r\n\r\nTeams are 3 persons each using the relay (45 touch) format.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $60.00 per team if registered by 9-12-16.  $80.00 per team after 9-12.\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2016-08-30","prereg_close":"2016-09-12","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is not a sanctioned event, however, all USFA tournament and safety rules will be adhered to.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes) CANCELLED\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\nDue to the need to accurately hire referees, we are sorry, but there can be no refunds for prepayments.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228766,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":135375,"tournament_id":34252,"tournament":"Liberty Open Saber","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-09-18T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":34774,"name":"Windy City Fencing Youth 11\/says Y10,12\/ and 14","start_date":"2016-09-18","end_date":"","comments":"$30 for preregistration ($35 at door).  \r\n$ 10 for second event. \r\nNOTE Y 11: This is a better break for the fencers in our club.Will use # 2 weapons.","prereg_open":"2016-08-30","prereg_close":"2016-09-16","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"$30 for preregistration ($35 at door). $ 10 for only for second event .  \r\n\r\nNOTE:  11 and under event.

Athletes without proof of membership must fill out all appropriate forms to pay for membership. Payment will be returned if membership can be verified.\r\nUSA Fencing is working towards an age verification process. An athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via email, mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the database. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and temporary membership cards.\r\nThis season, parents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to: information@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nYou will not be allowed to fence, no matter what events you participated in last season, without proof of USFA competitive membership and age verification.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES<\/b><ul>Standard fencing uniforms; cannot have any rips, tears, or holes. Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing glove must cover half of the forearm. Names on uniforms are not required.\r\nStandard fencing plastron; required with every uniform; women must wear chest protector.\r\nMask: 12K punch test. Sewn-in or channel (Leon Paul X-change style) bib. Conductive Bib in foil is required. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\nAny attachment to a weapon's handle must fix the hand in one position such that the top of the thumb is no more than 2 cm from the inner surface of the guard.\r\n<b>Sabre events will be fenced utilizing the 2016 timings (170 ms lockout) and starting position rules (rear foot on the on-guard line). <\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT FORMAT<\/b><ul>All events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations.  Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per RJCC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. \r\nNo fence off for 3rd place.\r\nFor Vet direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nFor Cadet and Junior events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nAll events serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments, therefore, no events may be combined regardless of number of entrants.\r\n<b>Sabre events will be fenced utilizing the 2016 timings (170 ms lockout) and starting position rules (rear foot on the on-guard line). <\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\nBout Committee\r\nBrenda Waddoups -

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2016-17 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2017, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 2000-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1998-2004 and for the cadet events 2001-2004.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661675,"longitude":-73.9793986,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":136726,"tournament_id":34581,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #1 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":30,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-09-25T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]}]}
