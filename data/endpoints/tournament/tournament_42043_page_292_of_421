NJFA has helped enrich the lives of hundreds of young children and their families. Along the way our students have experienced exceptional success both athletically and academically.  NJFA is proud to have assisted so many students to earn scholarships for colleges including Division I programs not to mention the hundreds of students that have utilized the NJFA network to assist in college acceptance and employment.\r\n\r\nEVENT\r\n\r\nThe Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) is sanctioned by USA Fencing and their Youth Development Committee (YDC). RYCs are a group of events in each region throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y10, Y12, and Y14 age categories in all three weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn regional points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families.The Y8 events listed are additional approved events and not part of the RYC.\r\n \r\nRYC's are one of the possible qualification paths for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\n\r\nThe USFA has made significant changes with respect to eligibility and qualification paths.  \r\nWe are providing the following information \/ schedule, for your convenience.  \r\n\r\nBeginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at the Summer Nationals will be National Championships. \r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) has been instituted to recognize participation and accomplishments of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. \r\nYouth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. The USFA has approved an abundance of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, only their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. \r\nFor more details please visit http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/5402\/2014-2015_Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative.pdf\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC.

Fencers must wear the required clothing regulation fencing jacket and pants, underarm protector (plastron), knee socks and a fencing glove that covers half the forearm. The electric foil bib is required. Women must wear breast protectors. In epee and foil, a full jacket is required (i.e., a jacket with croissard \/ groin strap). Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing uniforms or gloves must not have any rips, tears, holes, etc. USA Fencing allows uniforms of a single pastel color or designs on the rear (unarmed) arm and leg. As the purpose of uniform color or design is for audience interest, such designs should be in good taste. For safety and insurance purposes, fencers must wear full fencing attire while participating in drills, lessons or warm-up.\r\n\r\nBlade Length: Y8 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 27.5 inches (0). & Y10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches. Parents and fencers are advised that blades marketed as \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however some blades labeled as #2 have exceeded 32.5 inches, these blades will not be permitted. \r\n  \r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 7-8am on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly. Early Equipment check will be open the preceding Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday from 3pm-6pm.\r\n\r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords. Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition. \r\n\r\nNote that Blue Gauntlet Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance RYC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on Wednesday, March 22, 2017. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event's tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until the complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Friday or Saturday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Saturday or Sunday of this tournament.\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible in accordance with RYC guidelines with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established d according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nRYC tournaments are required to have at least 6 competitors for points to be awarded and cannot be a mixed competition.\r\n\r\nY10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 touches or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. \r\n\r\n(The rules for handling ties in score at the end of regulation, awarding of cards and non-combativity will apply as currently written.)\r\n\r\nFor Y12, Y14 and Junior Events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\r\n  \r\nUSA Fencing rules apply as set forth in the USA Fencing Rulebook and as discussed further in the USA Fencing Athlete Handbook (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/About-Us\/Manuals.aspx) \r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event.

utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but <b>NO JEANS OR SHORTS<\/b> allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or

So allow time for that check. \r\n\r\nDue to the early check in, Weapons Check will be open Thursday, December 8th, from 6pm to 8pm. If you are in the area and can come by early for armory checks please do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer Nationals and Point System: Regional Youth Circuit guidelines found here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ryc-resources\r\n\r\nAbout the area:\r\nThere are several restaurants within easy walking distance, Denny's, Wendy's, Starbucks, Togo's, Jack In The Box and a Mexican taqueria. But there are numerous restaurants within a short drive including Vietnam Town, an Asian themed shopping district with many fine restaurants and \"Plant Shopping Center\", your familiar large outdoor mall.\r\n\r\nAuto Parking: TFC has 50 parking spots. The curb directly in front of the building is a bicycle lane and tickets are issued for parking there. The Walmart Market just down the street has graciously allowed us to use their parking lot. They are approximately a 8 minute walk from TFC. Please park toward the street and avoid their customers or the north wall where their associates park. It is suggested that fencers be dropped off with their gear at the front of the venue before parking cars. Note that the Walmart is a grocery outlet and carries full line of sport drinks, fruits and snacks.

But for convenience we recommend \"The Elan\" which is only a few hundred feet away. It is a two star, no frills but clean and tidy motel which is generally available on weekends. http:\/\/www.hotelelansanjose.com\/\r\ncontact organizers if you want more info.","venue":{"name":"The

We intend to host one each month through Wheelchair Championships and Summer Nationals as warm-ups.  We will be adjusting things as we learn how such things go, so join in and help us develop!\r\n\r\nWeapons check will be available for your peace of mind, but not required.  800 Newton Saber gloves are required for sanctioned saber events.\r\n\r\nUtah Swords Academy hosts the Utah Fencing Foundation's wheelchair fencing program and, after separate warmups and drills, we routinely rotate all students to fence seated with our wheelchair fencers.  For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs.  Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated.  If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get really good with blade-work. Sort of like being backed up to the end of the strip. Like to get better at not dying at the end of the strip?  Do 'Walk and Roll'.   Try it - you'll like it!  The Saturday 'Walk and Roll' saber event is schedule between the youth and senior events so that youth can stay after and fence seated and seniors can come early and warm up fencing seated.  Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.

Join us for another youth tournament at RCFC. There will be foil events for all age groups, plus Y12 and Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #6\r\nDate(s): 04\/01\/2017\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, April 1st, 2017\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil; Y12 Epee\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $20 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2016-2017 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event.

Fencing cordially invites you to participate in the Holy Grail 2017 Three-Weapon Team Tournament!<\/b>\r\n\r\n****Please read through ALL the following rules, there are some changes due to our new location and limited space****\r\n\r\n<b> UPDATE 3\/28\/2017: <\/b> We are still accepting pre-registrations for the Sabre event on AskFRED, as well as Epee and Foil registrations on a case-by-case basis through email to fencing@andrew.cmu.edu. Those contacting us via email will be notified as soon as possible upon being accepted or denied to participate.\r\n\r\nThis year, we will be conducting an equipment check prior to the event, to reduce delays due to faulty equipment.\r\n\r\n-- Preregistration (via the FRED page or e-mail to \"fencing@andrew.cmu.edu\") is MANDATORY!\r\n-Any teams that fail to pre-register before the pre-registration cut-off (11:59 PM EDT on March 27, 2017) will not be permitted to participate.\r\n-Alterations to a registered team (including changing the team name or substitution of a fencer) may be allowed until 11:59PM EDT on March 31, 2017.\r\n\r\n--A maximum of THREE (3) teams per club per weapon will be allowed to fence, to limit the size of the tournament.\r\n***There will be an overall cap of 20 TEAMS PER WEAPON. If the cap has been reached and you would still like to participate, you may email your team name, the names of its members, and club to fencing@andrew.cmu.edu to be put on a waitlist.\r\n-Based on preregistration and referee commitments, this cap may be adjusted or lifted nearer to the date of the competition.\r\n-All teams must be composed of no fewer than three individual fencers, and no more than four individual fencers.\r\n-Double-entering will not be permitted - no individual fencer may be a member of more than one team, and no team may enter more than one event.\r\n-CMU Fencing requests that clubs and teams exercise tact and \"common sense\" in selecting team names - team names that contain overt offensive material (subject to the judgement of CMU Fencing; examples may include but are not limited to: profanities, excessive lewdness, national\/ethnic\/racial\/sexual\/etc slurs, defamation directed at individuals and\/or organizations, and so on) are subject to change.\r\n\r\n--All teams will advance into the DE round.\r\n\r\n-- Full fencing attire (including plastron, knickers, and long socks) must be worn by all participating fencers.\r\n-Use of a mask with a conductive bib in foil is required.\r\n-Use of a mask with a conductive bib is prohibited in epee, unless the conductive surfaces are completely and thoroughly covered in a resilient insulating material (e.g. heavy tape, such as duct tape).\r\n-Use of a mask with a transparent visor is prohibited in all events.\r\n\r\n-- Each participating club is expected to bring AT LEAST one (1) fully-functional scoring set (composed of one functioning scoring machine, two (2) functioning floor cords, two (2) functioning reels, and one reasonably long extension cord). \r\n-Each participating club is also expected to provide AT LEAST one (1) competent foil and\/or sabre referee (this referee can be a coach, or fence in the sabre event in order to direct the foil pools, but otherwise must be able to referee when called upon), and inform the bout committee of this person\u0092s name and preferred weapon to referee. Referees who talk to the bout committee at the start of the day, and devote the entire day to refereeing will be paid.\r\n-The epee event will be self-refereed.\r\n\r\n-- The entry fee is $30 per team and will be payable via check or (preferably) cash at the check-in\/bout committee table.\r\n\r\n-- Lastly, we ask that all teams keep their bags and spectators organized. Our space is, once again, limited this year, and we can't have people or objects in the way of the fencers or referees. You will be angrily notified if your area is not neat.\r\n\r\n-- CMU Fencing reserves the right to modify these rules as we learn more about who is coming and what other limitations might affect the tournament this year. Those who signed up will be notified of changes via email, and we apologize for any inconvenience.\r\n\r\nThere is free parking on weekends in the CMU East Campus Garage.

Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement.

Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional points do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\n-\tThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet, he\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\n-\tThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events.

This tournament is held in honor of Ned Light, a founding coach of our club whom we lost to cancer in 2011. Ned was a varsity fencer at Duke University, founder of Triangle Fencing Club, and a huge supporter of youth fencing in North Carolina. When Mid-South opened its first location in Durham in 2008, Ned brought his club to Mid-South to help kick-start the development of a competitive youth saber program in Durham.  Many of Ned's students have earned national medals and gone on to compete on varsity collegiate teams across the country.  \r\n\r\nJeff Kallio & Jennifer Oldham\r\nMid-South Fencers' Club\r\nDurham, NC\r\ninfo@midsouthfencersclub.org\r\n(919)-286-3100\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Mid-South Fencers Club","address":"125 N.

This tournament is held in honor of Ned Light, a founding coach of our club whom we lost to cancer in 2011. Ned was a varsity fencer at Duke University, founder of Triangle Fencing Club, and a huge supporter of youth fencing in North Carolina. When Mid-South opened its first location in Durham in 2008, Ned brought his club to Mid-South to help kick-start the development of a competitive youth saber program in Durham.  Many of Ned's students have earned national medals and gone on to compete on varsity collegiate teams across the country.  \r\n\r\nJeff Kallio & Jennifer Oldham\r\nMid-South Fencers' Club\r\nDurham, NC\r\ninfo@midsouthfencersclub.org\r\n(919)-286-3100\r\n\r\n***Update 3\/25\/2016: Youth 10 Women's Saber has been moved to 10:00am on Saturday. \r\n","venue":{"name":"Mid-South Fencers Club","address":"125 N.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.
