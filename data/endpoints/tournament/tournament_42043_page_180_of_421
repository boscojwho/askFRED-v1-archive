Any requests for refunds due to outstanding and unusual circumstances are at the discretion of the organizers and will be processed after the tournament.  Requests for refunds must be made in writing (postal or email: info@fenceintexas.org). <b>NO REFUNDS WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER 15 APRIL.<\/b>\r\n\r\nCombining Events: Youth 10 and 12 events may be combined by gender to provide a larger field of competition if there are fewer than 6 entries of one gender. For example, Y10 Men\u0092s & Women\u0092s Saber will be fenced as one event if fewer than 6 entries are in either gender; however, awards will still be given by gender.\r\n\r\nSeeding: Seeding will be based on the following order:\r\n\u0095 National Rolling Points Standing (RYC events go all the way down the NRPS, not just through the top 32)\r\n\u0095 Classification and year\r\n\u0095 If athlete has neither National Points nor a weapon classification they are seeded on a random basis with the other athletes in the same situation  \r\n\r\nTournament Organization\r\n* All events will be fenced electrically on appropriately grounded METALLIC STRIPS! \r\n* Masks, body cords AND LAMES will be subject to equipment control.  Foil fencers must have the conductive bib.  (Vendors are selling kits to refurbish your old mask.  Mr. Ovy recommends taking your mask and the kit to a shoe repairman to have it professionally attached.  Do not alter a new mask, or remove anything from it (like a tab) as this could invalidate the mask.)  \r\n* Seeding will be according to standard guidelines for ROC events. It is the responsibility of the fencer to notify the Bout Committee at the time of registration if they are on the NRPS. \r\n* One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches (or 2 out of 3 five touch encounters in Y12 and Y10). \r\n* Initial seeding will be posted on line as soon as possible after the close of the late registration period.  Fencers should check this initial seeding periodically and email info@fenceintexas.org with any changes.  It is the fencer's responsibility to provide proof of classification or club changes AS VERIFIED BY THE USFA.\r\n* Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash. \r\n* Organizers reserve the right to limit fencing in cross-over events in order to efficiently run the tournament.\r\n\r\n<b>USFA Membership<\/b>\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. ONE DAY USFA MEMBERSHIPS ARE NOT VALID FOR ENTRY INTO ROC EVENTS. Proof of membership is required. Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiver of Liability\r\nThe North Texas Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed.

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they are pre-qualified as described below.)\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  All fencers must be US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\nIf you have already qualified for Div II\/III\/Y14 through another means (see below), you can still attend this event.  You won't \"take up\" a qualification since you are already qualified - instead, you'll help the numbers but will be skipped when awarding qualifications.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule -----\r\n\r\n<table><tr><td><\/td><td>Men's Epee<\/td><td>Men's Foil<\/td><td>Men's Saber<\/td><td>Women's Epee<\/td><td>Women's Foil<\/td><td>Women's Saber<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Saturday<br\/>April 20<\/td><td>Y14<br\/>10:00 am<\/td><td>Div II\/III<br\/>10:00 am<\/td><td>Y14<br\/>11:00 am<br\/><br\/>Div II\/III<br\/>1:00 pm<\/td><td>Y14<br\/>10:00 am<br\/><br\/>Div II\/III<br\/>11:00 am<\/td><td><\/td><td>Y14<br\/>1:00 pm<br\/><br\/>Div II\/III<br\/>2:00 pm<\/td><\/tr><tr><td>Sunday<br\/>April 21<\/td><td>Div II\/III<br\/>10:00 am<\/td><td>Y14<br\/>12 noon<\/td><td><\/td><td><\/td><td>Y14<br\/>10:00 am<br\/><br\/>Div II\/III<br\/>11:00 am<\/td><td><\/td><\/tr><\/table>\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe registration fee is $20 per event.  \r\n\r\nRegistration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm PDT on Wednesday April 17th.  If you do not register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nEvent fees must be paid in cash or by check (made to \"WWD\") at the door.  We DO NOT accept credit or debit cards.   \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19266\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nEvents with 14 or fewer fencers will be run as a single round of pools followed by a direct elimination.\r\n\r\nEvents with 15 or more fencers will be run as TWO rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.  The combined results from the two pool rounds will be used to seed the DE tableau.  In events with more than 20 fencers, we will do a cut after the second round of pools based on the number of entries.\r\n\r\nThis two-rounds-of-pools format has proven to be popular with the fencers since it gives everyone a lot of fencing.  It also tends to \"smooth out\" the seeding - if you fence poorly in the first round of pools, you can redeem yourself by fencing well in the second round.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\nFoil masks with the electric bib are required in all foil events.  Foil and saber masks may NOT be used in epee events.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 1999 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 1998 - 2001\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14.  If you qualified for Division I-A at a ROC like the Battle in Seattle, you are already qualified for Div II\/III.  Some fencers also qualified for Division II\/III at the ROC held in Tacoma back in September.  Y14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event.\r\n\r\nThe USFA tracks who has already qualified on the Summer Nationals page on the USFA website.  Check the spreadsheet on that page for your name to see if you are listed as pre-qualified.  If you are unsure, ASK YOUR COACH!\r\n\r\nPre-qualified fencers are still welcome to fence at this event, since it helps the numbers and does not deny someone else a qualifier slot.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict (such as being out of town on business.)  \r\n\r\nContact dberke711@gmail.com for more info on petitions.","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"760 Harrison

Times listed are \"close of registration.\" A delicious lunch will be offered for $5 that includes main course, drinks, chips, dessert, etc., (different menu each day) so plan to eat here at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2012-2013) members of the USFA and must be members of the Oregon Division; fencers from other divisions are not eligible to compete. Y14 fencers must fall in that age bracket OR the athlete must be on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket.\r\n\r\nPermanent residents who have not represented another country in the last three years may participate.

All fencers must be current USFA members and be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership.  Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nIn each event, the top 25% (rounded up) who were not previously qualified (i.e. through a ROC) will qualify for SNQ, with a minimum of 3. If 3 or fewer fencers show up for an event, the event will not need to be fenced for qualification purposes (it can be fenced for the sake of awarding medals.)  Fencers that earn qualification at the DIV II events will automatically for the corresponding DIV III events event (if rating-eligible.)\r\n\r\nPre-registration on FRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Friday night, April 12, 2013. Also, please remember that we only accept cash or checks at Division events - NO credit\/debit cards.\r\n\r\nFees: Discounted registration fees are $15 per fencer, plus $10 per event (i.e., a total of $25 for one event) for those that preregister on AskFred by the deadline. After this time, fencers are welcome with late fees, if board notified prior to midnight of 4\/18. \r\n\r\nIf you want to both register for the tournament and the event in the week following the deadline, triple reg fees ($45) and double event fees ($20) will apply. If you are pre-registered on-time but want to add another event after the pre-reg deadline, double event fees for that event will apply (i.e. $20 per event.)  Walk-ins the weekend of the event (i.e after 4\/18): $90 registration and $60 per event. Save yourself money and pre-register in time. \r\n\r\nIf you are auto-qualified for your desired event at the SNQs (i.e. Div 2 men\u0092s foil), you are still encouraged to fence! (Fees waived for you for that event, but please still preregister on Askfred by the deadline. Please consult with bout committee at check-in to see if your presence will be needed.) Registration fees are non-refundable, but the per-event fees will not be charged if an event is not fenced.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. \r\n\r\nEach fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons, lame and\/or conductive mask (if needed), and two working body cords\/head cords. To facilitate the equipment check, division volunteers will be present the evening of April 19 at the NWFC from 6-7:30 to check the equipment of fencers who are competing Saturday. If you are fencing Sunday, please come by on Saturday to get your stuff checked and approved, and help us reduce lines the day of your event.

Qualification occurs by \"competing\" in a DIV II\/DIV III event for the weapon you would be interested in fencing for VET's at Summer Nationals. Qualification is limited to DIV II\/DIV III eligible fencers rated C and Below. Qualification for VET events is not dependent on your placement in the DIV II\/III qualifier (and is therefore automatic based solely on participation). However, any placement within the top 25% would additionally qualify you to compete in a DIV II\/DIV III event as allowed by your placement and classification. Therefore, a separate VET qualifier is not necessary, and will not be fenced, however, registration is available ONLY to indicate your intention to fence at a VET event at Summer Nationals. \r\n\r\nPlease see the USFA Athlete Handbook for qualification paths and requirements.  \r\n\r\nThere is NO walk-in registration for this tournament. USFA and Indiana Division membership required.\r\n \r\nEvents will be fenced ONLY if there are more than three competitors. The direct elimination round will be fenced to determine each place (no tie for third). If three or less fencers register for the event, those eligible fencers will be considered qualified. \r\n\r\nRegistration for this event closed Tuesday, April 16th.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"180 Central Park South","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10021","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.766113,"longitude":-73.9792804,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":84694,"tournament_id":20570,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Y14 Women's Epee","short_name":"Y14WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":84695,"tournament_id":20570,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":84696,"tournament_id":20570,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Div 2\/3 Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"Div 2\/3","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":84697,"tournament_id":20570,"tournament":"Metro Division National Championship Epee Quals","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Div 2\/3 Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"Div 2\/3","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":22110,"name":"LAIFC E & Under Foil Tournament","start_date":"2013-04-21","end_date":"","comments":"USFA sanctioned tournament.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87621,"tournament_id":21417,"tournament":"FAP Div3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21931,"name":"GMD Spring Fling, aka Summer National Qualifiers","start_date":"2013-04-21","end_date":"","comments":"Start times are now set!

Seeding will be determined USFA Letter Ranking with year classification. Athletes of the same classification\/year will be seeded randomly within their criteria. \r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence! \r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx\r\n \r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers  MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event.  Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Eligibility Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n \r\nFencers competing must be <b>current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member USA and of the Long Island Division.<\/b> To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n \r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found here: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Age-and-Classification-Requirements.aspx \r\nTo fence in Div 2\/3 events, fencer birth year must be 1999 or earlier.\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Uniform Requirements:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nCONDUCTIVE FOIL BIBS ARE REQUIRED THIS SEASON. As of August 1st, 2012, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the conductive foil bib.\r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords.

First events of the day may start sooner.\r\n\r\nDoors open about 45 minutes before the first event.\r\n\r\nWhat happened to Div IA?\r\nStarting with the 2011-12 season, USA Fencing has made the ROC's the primary qualification path for Div IA Summer Nationals.  For a list of ROCs, visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/2012-2013-USA-Fencing-Dates-and-Deadlines.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\nLocation & Parking\r\nTake the F\/G trains to Carroll Street station or get driving directions at http:\/\/www.brooklynfencing.com\/directions.html\r\nFor more information, visit our website, http:\/\/www.brooklynfencing.com or call 718.522.5822.\r\n\r\nThere is easy street parking around the club; however, be sure not to park in the \"no standing\" red signed zone directly in front of the club - you may well get a ticket even on a Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry & Eligibility\r\n$35 pre-registered on AskFred \/ $50 walk-ins at the door.  We encourage you to pre-register.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a qualifier, it is open ONLY to members of the Metropolitan Division.  If the USFA lists you under New Jersey, Long Island, Westchester, Alaska, or any other division you won't be able to fence in this event.\r\n \r\nYou must belong to the USFA or another FIE federation with proof of membership in order to compete.  Join or renew at http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership.  If you need to join the USFA on-site, you will need a separate check or credit card # for their form.  The $20 one-day membership is not eligible for qualifying events.\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y14 points will be allowed to fence Cadets.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA and Metropolitan Division sanctioned event. Ratings will be awarded where earned.\r\n\r\nPlease bring a check or cash if you don't prepay using AskFred; no credit cards accepted at the door for entry fees.\r\n\r\nNo refunds! If you need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail (info@brooklynfencing.com) by Friday, 4\/19, to receive a credit for a future event.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetition Format\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination; for 12 or fewer fencers, third place qualifying spot will be fenced off.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Center","address":"62 4th Street","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip":"11231","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.6771101,"longitude":-73.9940963,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":80310,"tournament_id":19412,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"35.00"},{"id":80311,"tournament_id":19412,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Qualifiers","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"35.00"},{"id":80312,"tournament_id":19412,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Women's Div II\/III qualifier Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"Div II\/III qualifier","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"35.00"},{"id":80313,"tournament_id":19412,"tournament":"Metro Div Summer Natls Foil Qualifiers","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Div II\/III qualifier Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":13,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"Div II\/III qualifier","close_of_reg":"2013-04-21T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"35.00"}]},{"id":21977,"name":"Oberlin College April Open","start_date":"2013-04-21","end_date":"","comments":"A fencing tournament for all levels and all weapons, to celebrate the beginning of May!
