This will be the 4th year fencing will be featured.  As with previous years this will be an OUTDOOR event, however this year we will not have the large tent to fence under.  There are tall trees to give us shade and protect us from the sun.  \r\n\r\nThis years events will be NON-SANCTIONED however all USFA rules will be in effect.  Electric scoring will be used.  Please come prepared with the proper equipment (blades, bodycords, lame, etc.).  No ratings will be issued however Sportsfest medals will be awarded to the top 3 finishers in each event as well as trophies for 1st, 2nd and 3rd for youth fencers.  Saturday's Youth Foil event will be a combined 10 and 12 year old competition.  Any fencer who qualifies for a Y-14 foil will fence in the Senior Mixed Foil on Sunday July 22nd.  \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE -->  Due to lack of space there will only be ONE STRIP AVAILABLE for use.  THEREFORE THERE IS A LIMIT OF 8 PARTICIPANTS FOR EACH EVENT.  Registration is now open to all clubs, however due to the experience level of the fencers who already pre-registered, senior foil and sabre will be limited to unrated fencers only.  Epee will be limited to D and under rated fencers only.  \r\n\r\nLastly but not at all least important.... These events at Sportsfest are not just for the fencers to be able to compete, but to display the sport itself to people who are totaly naive to fencing.  It is VITAL to display the highest level of sportsmanship and respect as possible.  Yelling, screaming, crying and arguing referee's calls will not be tolerated.  Thank you.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to a great time!  There's more to sportsfest than just the fencing.  Come out and enjoy the entire day to check out all the sports events going on.

He was born in Grand Forks, ND on August 2, 1930. Selberg received his Maitre D'Armes from the Federation International D'Escrime  in 1967.    In addition to being a fencing master, Selberg was also an abstract, post-impressionist painter. He has a painting in the permanent collection at Minnesota State University Moorhead in Moorhead, MN, and one also at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. On the side of the McCormick building in downtown Fargo is a restored version of his infamous sign painting of 'The Cowboy' that he painted originally in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey). Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas.     Sign painter, cartoonist and artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952 where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine of Arts degrees from San Francisco State University. Selberg taught art in San Francisco and fell in love with fencing in the early 1950's.    Fencing first appeared in North Dakota in 1960, when Maestro Selberg moved from San Francisco, where he was the head coach at the San Francisco School of Fencing (run by John McDougall), back to Fargo, ND, where he founded North Dakota's first fencing school, the Selberg Fencing Academy, which he operated in Fargo from 1960 to 1966. The Selberg Fencing Academy (SFA) was located originally at 54 1\/2 North 5th St. in Fargo, but was moved in 1965 to the Fargo Arena building in Island Park. Selberg thought that fencing would do well in Fargo because of the long cold winters that forced people inside for physical activity. Fencing competitions in Fargo during that time (including many dual matches between Minneapolis and Fargo) were held either at the SFA or at Moorhead State University, in their large gym. Between 1960 and 1966, the North Dakota division grew to become the 4th-largest fencing division in the country, and SFA fencers won three Midwest Championships, a Chicagoland Open Championship, and finished in the Top 10 at the U.S. National Championships in Women's Foil two years in a row.     Selberg returned to San Francisco in 1966 where he taught at the Halberstadt Fencer's club, and began his 16-year career teaching fencing at the University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College).    Known affectionately as Mr. Natural amongst fencers at the University of California at Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, Maestro Selberg was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, his creative ability, and his tremendous sense of humor. The fencing masters that taught Charles formed his most impressive fencing lineage: German born Eric Funke, followed by American born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian-born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on Charles\u0092 teaching. In 1970 he was a member of the three-man foil team that won the only gold medal ever for the U.S. at the World Masters Championships. Named one of the 'Great Fencing Masters in History' by Amarillo College in Texas, Charles was the author of the renowned books 'Foil' (1976) and 'Revised Foil' (1993). After retiring from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1982, he moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the Selberg Fencing Academy, and created an extensive series of instructional videos and DVDs (http:\/\/www.selbergfencing.com). Maestro Selberg taught that the greatest benefits that we get from fencing are health and recreation.","venue":{"name":"Southwest Youth Ice Arena  Fargo, ND","address":"4404 23 Avenue SW","city":"Fargo","state":"ND","zip":"58104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":46.843967,"longitude":-96.8588891,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":50,"name":"Nebraska-South Dakota","abbrev":"NE-SD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":78506,"tournament_id":18953,"tournament":"2012 Charles Selberg Memorial Open","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-08-04T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":18964,"name":"CF Back 2 School\/Back 2 Saber Circuit #1","start_date":"2012-08-04","end_date":"","comments":"Back to School\/Back to Saber youth and open tournament circuit-event 1 of 3\r\n\r\nThree tournaments, back to back weekends, one overall champion!\r\n\r\n$10 per event or $25 for all 3 circuit events WITH PREREG.\r\n\r\nWalk in is an additional $10 fee.","prereg_open":"2012-07-09","prereg_close":"2012-08-03","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Back 2 School\/Back 2 Saber youth and open tournament circuit-event 1 of 3\r\n\r\nThree tournaments, back to back weekends, one overall champion!\r\n\r\n$10 per event or $25 for all 3 circuit events WITH PREREG.\r\n\r\nWalk in is an additional $10 fee.\r\n\r\nJoin us to ring in the new season and get back to fencing after the summer!

Remember,anyone participating in a foil event will also need 2 mask cords.\r\n\r\nPer USFA, dated 4\/17\/12: http:\/\/usfencing.org\/news\/2012\/04\/17\/conductive-foil-bib-required-for-all-usa-fencing-sanctioned-events-beginning-in-2012-2013\/47657\r\nFor the 2012-2013 season, a conductive bib is required for any national event that selects a team: Div I, Junior, Cadet, Veteran 50-60, Veteran 60-70, and Veteran 70+ and Wheelchair.\r\n\r\nAfter August 1, 2012 the electric bib is required for ALL USA Fencing-sanctioned events, at all levels (local, regional, and national).\r\n\r\nDetails are as follows: \r\n\r\n\u0095The lam\u00e9 part of the bib must cover all of the bib up to a horizontal line 1.5-2 cm below the chin. \r\n\u0095The mask cord must be 30-40 cm long, and can be of any color. It may be straight, or coiled. \r\n\u0095The mask cord must be attached on the non-weapon side of the bib. \r\n\u0095For foil events that do not require an electric bib, you are allowed to tape the edge of the bib to prevent conductivity.(NOT PERTINENT TO KSG,ALL EVENTS ARE ELECTRIC)\r\n\u0095The electrical characteristics of the bib are the same as the lame. \r\n\u0095The electrical characteristics of the mask cord are the same as the body cord. \r\n\u0095Transparent masks are prohibited. \r\n\u0095Masks with exchangeable bibs are allowed. (If the inspection mark is placed on the bib, be sure not to change out your inspection mark!) \r\n\u0095Masks with overlay bibs are available and legal. Both the overlay and the mask itself must have inspection marks though to ensure the bib has no dead spots, and the mask itself is safe.\r\nThere are no changes to rules regarding masks for epee, but notably you may NOT use a saber mask or a foil mask with electric bib in epee. The metal on the bib\/mask can ground out the opponent\u0092s tip. Transparent masks are prohibited.\r\n\r\nRules concerning the conductive bib on the foil mask can be found in the current USFA rulebook t.471.2\r\n\r\n\r\n$25 for the first event, $10 for each additional event.\r\nPreregistration closes August 3,2012.\r\n\r\nKeystone State Games charges an admission fee for spectators (anyone not competing, officiating or volunteering; either an $8 daily fee, or a $15 \"All Event Pass\" good throughout the tournament.\r\nAs fencing tournament organizers, we have no control over these fees as they have been set by the Keystone State Games, Inc. We have attempted to obtain an exception for \r\nparents and siblings, but have been informed that the fees are not negotiable.
