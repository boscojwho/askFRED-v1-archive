These include, but are not limited to, the following:\r\n\r\nWAIVER OF LIABILITY:\r\nA completed waiver form signed by a parent or legal guardian at check-in is required NO ONE WILL BE ALLOWED TO FENCE WITHOUT A SIGNED WAIVER.\r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\nSeeding is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter rankings, then by classification year. Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/5402\/Regional_Recognition_Initiative_Information_Document_2015-2016_-3.9.15.pdf\r\n\r\nRYC and RJCC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by organizers from USA Fencing.  \r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the bout committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted. \r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS\r\nSAFETY AND EQUIPMENT POLICY\r\nRYC and RJCC events are run in accordance with USFA rules and formats. \r\n\r\nFull fencing uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron, fencing knickers, knee length socks and glove. Additionally, chest protectors are required for girls. All USFA uniform requirements apply. Conductive bibs are required for foil fencers.\r\n\r\nEach fencer is required to have two working electric weapons, and two working body cords. Foil and saber fencers need two working mask cords and saber fencers must have over-glove conductive sleeves. \r\n\r\nALL Y10 fencers will be required to use size \u00930\u0094 or size \u00932\u0094 blades (less than 32.5 inches long).

There must be FEWER THAN 5 ENTRIES IN ONE GENDER for the event to be combined.\r\n\r\nRYC AGE VERIFICATION\r\nUSA Fencing requires age verification for ALL participants (domestic and foreign).

Our goal is to create a positive tournament experience and setting for every fencer, while providing a level of professionalism expected of an elite fencing center.\r\n\r\nThe SFSFL incorporates two Circuits within its infrastructure, The Junior & Open Circuit (JOC) and The Individual Challenge Circuit (ICC).  The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.  These ranking systems mirror that of the National Governing Body, USA Fencing, and the International Governing Body, Federation International de\u0092 Escrime (FIE).  Each tournament in the JOC will award fencers in the final four with medals.  Each tournament in the ICC will award the final eight fencers with medals.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show.  If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again.  If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above.  Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch.  If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament.  Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.
