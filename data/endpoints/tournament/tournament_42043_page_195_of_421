Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2013-14 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2014, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1994-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1995-2001 and for the cadet events 1998-2001.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"191 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661365,"longitude":-73.9793266,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":93031,"tournament_id":23088,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #2 Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":32,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-27T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":24139,"name":"BCAF 15th Annual  Flynn Epee Memorial Tourny","start_date":"2013-10-27","end_date":"","comments":"CANCELLED EVENT","prereg_open":"2013-09-18","prereg_close":"2013-10-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":45,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"<b>BCAF\u0091s SIGNATURE EPEE EVENT (and now Annual Animal Alliance Fundraiser)<\/b>\r\n\r\nOn August 2nd 1998 the fencing community lost a great friend. During a summer competition in New Hope at the Bucks County Academy of Fencing, Bob Flynn suddenly passed away in the middle of an epee bout. His dedication to and love of fencing was an inspiration to three generations of fencers. This tournament is dedicated to his memory & contributions to the sport.\r\n\r\nBeginning last year, \u0093Fencers eat Free at the Flynn\u0094 with all additional food sales being donated to Animal Alliance in Lambertville. Animal Alliance is a 501(c)3, non-profit that rescues\/rehabilitates shelter cats & dogs, placing 500+ into new homes each year. AA's Planned Pethood clinic provides low cost spay\/neuter\/vaccines to the public. http:\/\/www.animalalliancenj.org\/\r\n\r\nFencers from all over the east coast and further have traveled to participate in this event. It has been an A-rated event for the past 13 years. A great event, with great fencing, and for a great cause! Please join us!\r\n\r\nPre-register and <b>pay online<\/b> by October 23; $45. NO WALK-INS! Limit - 48 fencers. Use \"Email the Organizer\" link (or debbie@bcaf.com) to add yourself to the waiting list. (Do NOT call BCAF.)  Names will be added in the order received. (See official waiting-list policy below.) \r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2013-2014 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-Lambertville Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFormat: 1 Round of pools with 100% promotion to DE round (WITH fence-off for third place). Ratings, prizes and medals will be awarded.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USA Fencing-sanctioned event. Current USA Fencing membership and full regulation uniform required. \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF. You acknowledge you are entering this tournament at your own risk and release the USFA and its sponsors, BCAF, and referees from any liability.

ALL EVENTS ARE CFF SANCTIONED.\r\n\r\nNational domestic ranking points are earned on the senior ranking for senior events.\r\n\r\nNote: Events will be cancelled if there are less than 6 people registered; those fencers who have registered will then be asked if they wish to participate in a mixed event. The CFF Competition Rules allow for up to 5 individuals of the opposite gender to the competition to be mixed in - the event will still be ranked as a single event. Your points will show up for that weapon and age group.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- EQUIPMENT: ----------\r\n\r\nAll entrants must wear proper protective equipment (fencing jacket, plastron, breeches, mask and glove) during competition. Masks must pass a punch test (FIE label not required) and be stamped prior to the event. All fencers must wear a plastron (350 N or higher underarm protector) at all times.

Your CFF\/BCFA membership must be in good standing in order to participate in the tournament. Memberships cannot be purchased at the tournament - please purchase your passport ahead of time or we may not be able to validate it on the day of the tournament.

Thank you for your cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- PRIZES: ----------\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to the top four fencers of each event. \r\n\r\n\r\n---------- DIRECTIONS: ----------\r\n\r\nHere is a link showing the location of the Student Union Building in UBC: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/index_detail.php?locat1=790&show=y,n,n,n,n,y\r\n\r\nHere is a map of the UBC campus: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/images\/pdf\/ubcmap.pdf\r\n\r\nHere is a Google map of the campus: http:\/\/maps.google.ca\/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6138+Student+Union+Boulevard,+Vancouver,+BC&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=27.881336,81.738281&ie=UTF8&ll=49.268379,-123.250186&spn=0.006875,0.019956&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=0\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] on the map.\r\n\r\nThere is a parkade north of the SUB called 'North Parkade' you can park in. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building between the Student Recreation Centre (SRC) and the War Memorial Gym. \r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry or the border after Oak St Bridge:\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive, or\r\nOption B: follow Oak Street all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Avenue - that is the first and only exit on the right close to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights, do not run the red lights, okay?\r\n\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it is a bit far away from the SUB. IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park. On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $6.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard. \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc@gmail.com\r\n","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1Z1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.2658449,"longitude":-123.2426345,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":97836,"tournament_id":24457,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2013","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":11,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-27T09:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":97837,"tournament_id":24457,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2013","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-27T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21386,"name":"Rescheduled 2013  Senior Games S.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 10\/23\/13.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94048,"tournament_id":23332,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC ","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-02T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24105,"name":"Tournament at the Tracks","start_date":"2013-11-02","end_date":"","comments":"Come to Greenville for a high quality competition at PCFA.

There will be foil events for all Youth age groups, plus Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\nSchedule note: As we did last time, the Youth-8 event has been moved to 10:00 AM so it can be combined with the Youth-10's if necessary.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #2\r\nDate(s): 11\/02\/2013\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 2nd, 2013\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y8, Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $10 (plus tax) per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2013-2014 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: Y8 and Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touches, 2 periods of 3 minutes each. The first period ends when 3 minutes have elapsed or one fencer scores 5 touches, whichever comes first. Y12 direct elimination bouts are now 15 touches, 3 periods of 3 minutes each -- just like Y14 and senior DE bouts.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2003-2006\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1999-2002\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=24054\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/14\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

This competition is for all weapons in the Y-8 to Y-14 age categories. This event will award NJFA Youth Cup Points to the top eight fencers. \r\n\r\nDOOR PRIZE KINDLE FIRE HD TABLET\r\nAll fencers who are registered by October 18th and compete, will receive one entry for each event.

This event is designed to assist our youth fencers in gaining experience in larger \"USFA-style\" competitions without having to travel outside of their local region.\r\nThe RYC (Regional Youth Circuit) tournaments are held throughout the season, similar to the Super Youth Circuit  tournaments. There are NO national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March and \/ or July NACs. Events may be combined to provide a larger field of competition if there are fewer than 5 entries of one gender. \r\n\r\nSince only the winner of Y14 events qualify for Y14 at Summer Nationals, these events will not be mixed.  RYC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE license.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Note: At least 2 athletes must compete (have fenced) in a given RYC age\/weapon event to fulfill eligibility requirements for the Y10 and\/or Y12 NAC or for a first place finish to result in qualification to the Y14 Summer National Championships. Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed will not result in the athlete fulfilling qualification requirement. i.e. Y14 events will need to have at least two athletes of the same gender to be a qualifying event.\r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD!

If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94049,"tournament_id":23333,"tournament":"FAP Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":17,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-11-03T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24636,"name":"New Beginnings","start_date":"2013-11-03","end_date":"","comments":"This is a beginner foil competition for youth and senior age.

As a youth of 18, while vacationing with his parents, he was challenged to a duel by an Italian nobleman who mistakenly assumed he had designs on a young lady.  He won the duel, which was fought with epees.  He had a distinguished career as an architect in Washington D.C. and returned to fencing at the NIH club in the 1990's, when he was in his 70's. He went to England on one of the first USA Veteran teams before World Veteran Championships were officially recognized.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.
