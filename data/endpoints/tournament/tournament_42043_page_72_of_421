If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Women's Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/14\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":35939,"tournament_id":8067,"tournament":"Women's Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-05-16T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":8581,"name":"Landlubber Youth Open","start_date":"2009-05-16","end_date":"","comments":"USFA event for Y14, Y12, and Y10 foilists.

There will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the \r\nUSFA 2008-2009 age requirements: \r\nYouth-8: born in 2000-2003\r\nYouth-10: born in 1998-2001\r\nYouth-12: born in 1996-1999\r\nYouth-14: born in 1994-1997\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series. \r\nThe first series will end at Youth Progressive #4 and will be based on points earned in the \r\nYouth Progressive tournaments #1-4.\r\n The second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the \r\nYouth Progressive tournaments #5-8. \r\nTrophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil, \r\nYouth-12 Foil,Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee. \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1. Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event. If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2. Events are mixed (boys and girls). Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender. (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3. Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments. Point standings will be posted at http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4. The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series. For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n------------------\r\nSchedule (close of registration times & award ceremony times):\r\n\r\n9:00am Close of registration: Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n10:30am Close of registration  Y8 Foil\r\n12:30pm Awards ceremony for Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee & Y8 Foil\r\n\r\n1:00pm Close of registration: Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil\r\n2:30pm Close of registration  Y12 Epee\r\n5:00pm Awards ceremony for Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil & Y12 Epee\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for fencers born in 2001 or earlier years, and can be purchased or renewed at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Avenue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.48434,"longitude":-122.782564,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":36476,"tournament_id":8179,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #7","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-05-16T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36477,"tournament_id":8179,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #7","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-05-16T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36479,"tournament_id":8179,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #7","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-05-16T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36480,"tournament_id":8179,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #7","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-05-16T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36481,"tournament_id":8179,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #7","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-05-16T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6649,"name":"BFCC - Mixed 'U' Foil ","start_date":"2009-05-16","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2008-08-30","prereg_close":"2009-05-15","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"BFC - Columbia","address":"9515 Gerwig Lane, Suite 101","city":"Columbia","state":"MD","zip":"21046","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":29945,"tournament_id":6649,"tournament":"BFCC - Mixed 'U' Foil ","full_name":"Unrated Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":32,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-05-16T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7935,"name":"FVFA 3-Weapon D & Under and Y12 Mixed Foil","start_date":"2009-05-16","end_date":"2009-05-17","comments":"Tournament will be mixed unless at least 6 fencers enter.
