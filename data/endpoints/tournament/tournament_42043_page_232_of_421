If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot behind building, enter from Glenside Avenue. We are Suite 201, Building C.  Bring food and drink, their are changing rooms but no showers.  The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108132,"tournament_id":27344,"tournament":"FAP-North Div3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-18T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28627,"name":"Porthos Youth 2015","start_date":"2015-01-18","end_date":"","comments":"USFA Membership required;

NJFA has helped enrich the lives of hundreds of young children and their families. Along the way our students have experienced exceptional success both athletically and academically.  NJFA is proud to have assisted so many students to earn scholarships for colleges including Division I programs not to mention the hundreds of students that have utilized the NJFA network to assist in college acceptance and employment.\r\n\r\nEVENT\r\n\r\nDr. D'Ambola is a legend in US fencing. He is an outstanding left handed fencer and was a member of the undefeated Seton Hall University team, several times state champion in individual and in team events. He coached Essex Catholic High School for 14 years. During his time, his fencers won nine team state championships, 8 Cetrullo Tournament Championships and 2 greater New York Championships. Dr. D'Ambola is an inducted member of the National Fencing Hall of Fame, Seton Hall University Hall of Fame, Newark Athletic Hall of Fame, Essex Catholic High School Hall of Fame and was inducted into the NJSIAA hall of fame last year.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) is sanctioned by USA Fencing and their Youth Development Committee (YDC). RYCs are a group of events in each region throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y10, Y12, and Y14 age categories in all three weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn regional points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families.The Y8 events listed are additional approved events and not part of the RYC.\r\n \r\nRYC's are one of the possible qualification paths for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\n\r\nThe USFA has made significant changes with respect to eligibility and qualification paths.  \r\nWe are providing the following information \/ schedule, for your convenience.  \r\n\r\nBeginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at the Summer Nationals will be National Championships. \r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) has been instituted to recognize participation and accomplishments of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. \r\nYouth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. The USFA has approved an abundance of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, only their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. \r\nFor more details please visit http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/5402\/2014-2015_Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative.pdf\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC.

to commence immediately afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in multiple sessions, but only one event per session.\r\nY8, Y10 and Y12 event DE's will be a best 2 out of 3 bouts of 5 point bouts.\r\nY14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout with three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 and Y10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior events will use #5 weapons.\r\nAll youth events will be fenced mixed (boys and girls together).\r\nSeparate awards for boys' and girls' placements may be given.\r\nCadet and Junior events will require foil masks with bibs and head-wires.\r\nWe will be testing weapons in Cadet and Junior events.\r\nCadet and Junior events will be CFF sanctioned, so CFF memberships will be required.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's

Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All Saints Elementary School Gymnasium","address":"1405 Como Lake

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

The local pizza place is open  Saturday but not Sunday.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0974096,"longitude":-75.1452389,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108135,"tournament_id":27346,"tournament":"FAP-North Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-25T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28643,"name":"Western New York Circuit #5","start_date":"2015-01-25","end_date":"","comments":"Number 5 of the series of senior\/open competitions for Western NY foil, sabre, and epee fencers.

If there are at lease 5 girls and 5 boys, we will separate the event by gender.\r\n\r\n This is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful. \r\n\r\n Fencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver to participate. All events will be fenced electronically. There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament. \r\n\r\n These tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\n Beginning referees are welcome! We will provide lunch for anyone refereeing multiple events. Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\n For additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\n Brenda Waddoups\r\n Fencing Institute of Texas, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=28697\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/30\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If there are eight or more teams in a particular event, we will alter the format (by creating pools and a bracket) so the event will be limited to a reasonable amount of time.\r\n\r\n**UPDATE** Due to the large amount of interest in this competition, we will not be able to do a round-robin. To try and still get a lot of fencing in while also moving things along, we're going to do pools of 3-5 teams, and then seed from pools into DEs. It'll basically be set up like an individual competition, except with teams. We also have to leave our venue at 7pm, when it closes. In the event of epee (or foil) DEs extending past that, we'll reconvene at Twin Cities Fencing Club (741 Holly Avenue, Saint Paul, MN) at 7.30 to fence the final rounds.\r\n\r\nTeams may be mixed gender. Teams may also compete in more than one event. If you do not have a full team, feel free to register with a partial team. There will probably be extra fencers at the event who will be available to complete teams. The competition will be self-directed.\r\n\r\nFor access to the venue, you will need to go in the main entrance of the University Recreation Center. You will need to let the front desk know that you are here for the fencing tournament, and they can direct you.
