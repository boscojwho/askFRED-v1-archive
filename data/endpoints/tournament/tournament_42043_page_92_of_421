This season, we are asking every club in the Division to try to put together at least one junior or senior team to compete in this important qualifying event.\r\n\r\nTo correct some major misunderstandings about this team event, the qualifying teams gain qualification for their club (if they represent one).  Specific team members need not plan to attend the summer national championships in order to compete in the qualifier.  If a team qualifies, any representatives of the club may go to the summer nationals as part of that team.\r\n\r\nTeam competition follows a 9-bout, round-robin competition in a single weapon with relay-style scoring to a maximum of 45 touches.  Teams are randomly assigned by the FencingTime software to an elimination table, and compete in a direct elimination round until we reach the number of teams that can qualify in each weapon.\r\n\r\nWe encourage everyone who wishes to compete in this important qualifying event.  We hope to see fencers from all parts of the Division participating on March 20-21.  Please register well in advance so we can have the requisite number of officials available to give you the best team competition possible. The on time registration fee is $75. A $50 LATE CHARGE WILL BE ADDED TO THE REGISTRATION COST STARTING 3\/16\/2010. No refunds after 3\/18\/2010.\r\n\r\nSummer National qualifier for all Junior and Senior teams composed of NJ Division fencers. TEAMS MUST SHOW UP AND COMPETE TO QUALIFY.

To make the experience more informative and less stressful Youth Progressives will be done a bit differently: \r\n \r\nThe BFC will make extra electrical equipment available for athletes. \r\nCompetitors do not need to be members of the USFA. \r\nArmorers will be available to explain how the equipment works and repair equipment that fails inspection. \r\nReferees will go over the hand signals and explain how the pool works to the athletes and parents. \r\nBout committee personnel will explain how the competition will run to athletes and parents. \r\nWhen\/if an infraction occurs, the referees will explain the particular rule to the competitor and offer a suggestion to fix the issue before handingout warnings. \r\nThe event will be on askfred.net to help the athletes learn about signing up and at a reduced rate for those that sign up in a timely fashion. \r\nThere will be an awards table for the top 8 finishers to choose their prize.   First place picks first, 2nd place next etc. \r\n \r\nAgain, Youth Progressives are fun fencing events designed to help young athletes (and parents) to learn about and prepare for competitions. \r\n \r\nHope you can make, \r\n \r\nMichael Marx \r\nDirector of BFC Fencing Operations \r\n\r\nEvent fees:\r\n$10.00 Registration fee\r\n$10.00 Per Event if registering at the door; If pre-registered on Askfred, fees are $5.00 per event.  \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nUnrated Y10 Mixed Foil (2pm close of registration)\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed Foil ( beginning 15 yr olds are allowed to fence!)

A team may be composed of fencers of either gender (that is, all-male or all-female fencers), or be of mixed composition (that is, male and female fencers as members of the same team).\r\n\r\nComposite teams (where one or more team members may hail from another organization) are allowed in those cases where an organization cannot field a complete team on its own.\r\nAny organization may enter more than one team in any event (i.e. more than one team per weapon per organization). However, \"double entering\" (i.e. having any team (pre)register\/participate in more than one weapon-event and\/or having any individual fencer (pre)register\/participate as a member \u00e2\u0080\u0093 even as an alternate - of more than one team, either within or across weapon-events) is, without exception, prohibited.\r\n\r\n-- <b>All fencers are REQUIRED to have safe, competition-caliber attire.<\/b> The fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attire must provide the fencer with an optimal level of protection without compromising the freedom of movement necessary for fencing. Full protection for the upper body, in the form of well-maintained modern fencing attire (fencing mask, fencing jacket, fencing plastron\/\u00e2\u0080\u009dunderarm protector\u00e2\u0080\u009d, fencing glove, and rigid chest-protector(s) (required for women, optional for men)), is MANDATORY; fencing without any one or more of these required items is, without exception, prohibited.\r\n\r\nFencing knickers (and the accompanying knee-length socks) are HIGHLY RECOMMEND, although the knickers\/socks combination may be substituted for another garment (or combination of garments) that will provide (through appropriate coverage\/overlapping AND resistance to puncture and tearing) protection equal to or greater than that provided by the knickers\/socks combination to the entirety of the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s legs and lower body. The outermost garment must extend to (or below) the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s knees when worn in the manner intended\/implied by the garment\u00e2\u0080\u0099s design, and all visible\/exposed sections of the garment(s) in question must be free of features (such as cargo pockets, exposed loops, etc.) that could entangle\/trap an opponent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s weapon. The acceptability of the substitute garment(s) is at the discretion of the tournament organizer(s) and\/or bout committee personnel.\r\nShoes must be of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cathletic shoe\u00e2\u0080\u009d\/\u00e2\u0080\u009dtennis shoe\u00e2\u0080\u009d\/\u00e2\u0080\u009dsneaker\u00e2\u0080\u009d\/etc type, and must not feature cleats or other devices\/characteristics which may damage varnish.\r\n\r\n-- In order to A.) streamline and accelerate the check-in process, and B.) reduce, if not outright eliminate, the possibility of catastrophic error during the check-in process, <b>the organizer(s) are now requiring each team interested in participating in the tournament to pre-register (through an online service, such as askFRED.net, or through e-mail to \u00e2\u0080\u009cfencing@andrew.cmu.edu\u00e2\u0080\u009d) for their event prior to the tournament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s preregistration deadline (12:00am on the morning of the day of the tournament)<\/b>. That is to say:\r\n\r\n1.) <b>Teams who did not pre-register, or who attempted to pre-register after the given deadline, will not be permitted to enter the event.<\/b>\r\n2.) Any pre-registered team that does not check-in before the beginning of pools, and attempts to check in while the pool round of the event they are attempting to enter is under way, is subject to elimination from the tournament - a decision that is at the discretion of the bout committee and is based on a number of factors, including the progress of each pool, pool composition, and so on.\r\n3.) <b>Any pre-registered team that is not checked-in before the end of the pool round of the event they are attempting to enter, and attempts to check in after the pool round of the event has ended, may not be permitted to fence in that event.<\/b>\r\n4.) Any and all other issues that may arise for any team that has correctly pre-registered and checked-in shall be addressed by the bout committee and\/or tournament organizer(s) as their workload permits.\r\n\r\n-- The tournament is divided into multiple events by weapon (i.e. there will be one foil event, one epee event, and one sabre event). Each event will consist of two rounds: one set of \u00e2\u0080\u0098round-robin\u00e2\u0080\u0099 15-touch relay pools for seeding purposes and one direct elimination (DE) round that will follow the 45-touch relay bout format used by the USFA.\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of the pool round, the teams' placements into the DE tableau are determined, based on their performance.\r\n<b>If there are 24 or fewer teams entered into an event, all of the teams shall advance to the DE round. If there are more than 24 teams entered into an event, only the top 24 shall be permitted to advance to the DE round.<\/b>\r\n\r\nAs the DE round progresses, the teams' placements upon elimination determine the number of \u00e2\u0080\u009cGrail Points\u00e2\u0080\u009d (GP) awarded to each team. The team that finishes in first place will receive a number of GP equal to the number of teams in the DE round, the second place team shall receive a number of GP equal to one less than the number of teams in the DE round, the third place teams shall each receive a number of GP equal to two less than the number of teams in the DE round, and so on, with the team placing the lowest receiving a single GP.\r\n\r\nIf an organization holds a tied place (both third place teams, for example), only the number of GP awarded to one of the teams is counted.\r\nEach team that did not advance from the pool round to the DE round receives 0 GP.\r\nIf an organization did not enter a team into an event, that organization receives 0 GP for that event.\r\n\r\nOver the course of the tournament, the organizations' total GP at that point will be determined by the sum of the GP awarded to each organization's highest placing team in each event. If an organization has more than one team in an event, only the highest placing team is counted. \r\n\r\nThe organization with the greatest cumulative GP total at the end of the tournament shall be declared the winner, and shall be awarded the championship title and possession of the Holy Grail.\r\n\r\n-- In the event of a two-way tie for the greatest cumulative GP total, the organizations in question will select one fencer from each weapon (that is, a single foilist, a single epeeist, and a single sabreur) to compose a three-fencer, three-weapon team.\r\nThe order in which the bouts are fenced, and the method(s) to be used in determining that order, are at the discretion of the tournament organizer(s) and\/or bout committee personnel.\r\n\r\nThe tie-breaker match will start 10 minutes after the end of the final match of the last event to finish, or as soon as both teams agree to start, whichever occurs first. The fencers of like weapons will face one another in five-point bouts, with the team that achieves two victories being declared the winner.\r\n\r\n-- The organization possessing the Holy Grail will be responsible for the engraving of their organization\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name and year of victory onto the appropriate metal plate affixed to the base of the Holy Grail (and to affix and engrave a new plate, if necessary), and will be required to ensure that the Holy Grail arrives at the next tournament, and to defend their championship title at the next tournament (if willing\/able). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: Holy Grail 2009\r\nDate(s): 03\/27\/2010\r\nLocation: Skibo Gymnasium\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nMixed Team Epee  | Sat 3\/27 | 1:00 PM\r\nMixed Team Foil  | Sat 3\/27 | 11:00 AM\r\nMixed Team Saber  | Sat 3\/27 | 3:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=10595\r\nPreregistation closes on 03\/27\/2008\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

We will have the right to refuse you if you do not have a validated CFF licence prior to the tournament.  If you wish to renew or purchase a CFF\/BCFA membership, please visit these websites ahead of time and make the necessary payments: \r\nhttp:\/\/www.fencing.ca\/cff_licence_info.htm\r\n\r\nPre-registration closes on Friday, March 26, 2010.

Fencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form and hand that in at the time of registration.  If you wish to obtain a copy of the waiver form, please contact us by email.  Thank you for your cooperation.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- PRIZES: ----------\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to the top four fencers of each event.  \r\n\r\n\r\n---------- DIRECTIONS: ----------\r\n\r\nHere is a link showing the location of the Student Union Building in UBC: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/index_detail.php?locat1=790&show=y,n,n,n,n,y\r\n\r\nHere is a map of the UBC campus: http:\/\/www.maps.ubc.ca\/PROD\/images\/pdf\/ubcmap.pdf\r\n\r\nHere is a Google map of the campus: http:\/\/maps.google.ca\/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=6138+Student+Union+Boulevard,+Vancouver,+BC&sll=49.891235,-97.15369&sspn=27.881336,81.738281&ie=UTF8&ll=49.268379,-123.250186&spn=0.006875,0.019956&z=16&iwloc=addr&om=0\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] on the map.\r\n\r\nThere is a parkade north of the SUB called \u00e2\u0080\u009cNorth Parkade\u00e2\u0080\u009d you can park in. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building between the Student Recreation Centre (SRC) and the War Memorial Gym. \r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry or the border after Oak St Bridge:\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive, or\r\nOption B: follow Oak Street all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Avenue \u00e2\u0080\u0093 that is the first and only exit on the right close to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights \u00e2\u0080\u0093 do not run the red lights, okay?\r\n\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it is a bit far away from the SUB.  IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $4.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- HOTEL ACCOMMODATIONS: ----------\r\n\r\nAccommodations at the University of British Columbia are available for those who wish to stay on campus for the tournament.  Reservations can be booked online.\r\n\r\nMore information can be found here: http:\/\/www.ubcconferences.com\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries
