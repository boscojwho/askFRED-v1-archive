Check your rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing and national point standing at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings.\r\n\r\nEach event consists of two rounds (pools and direct elimination)\r\nPools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round.\r\nDirect Elimination Tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round.\r\nFor Y14 and Y12, DE bouts are 15 touch\/9-minute bouts. For Y10, DE bouts are 10-touch bouts\/6 minute bouts. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\nMedals awarded to Top 8. No fence-off for third place.\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications.\r\nPhotography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\n50 Burnett Avenue, Maplewood, NJ (use 54 Burnett Avenue for GPS\/Mapquest); Conveniently located near all major highways in NJ, NY, CT, and Pennsylvania.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Competitors earn cumulative points based on a weighted point formula.\r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Prizes\r\n\r\nOur Grand Prizes are brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event and date, along with a guitar strap, stand and wall mount worth several hundred dollars each!

To further encourage fencing in the schools, we added individual foil events for Middle School fencers. \r\n\r\nWhen you fence in this tournament you will be representing your School instead of your club. \r\n\r\nThis tournament is open to High School (9-12 grades) and Middle\/Junior High School (6-8 grades) fencers. Fencers must be competitive members of USA Fencing (may be on a school roster). Remember: You are representing your school and not your club. Your school does not have to have a fencing team for you to represent your school and earn points.\r\n\r\nRegistration fee = $20\r\nIndividual Event Fee (Per event) = $20\r\nTeam event fee (per team) = $40\r\n\r\nEligibility\r\nThe tournaments of the North Texas Scholastic Fencing League are \"open\" to fencers who are in the appropriate age group as defined by their year in school. High School fencers are in grades 9 through 12; Middle School fencers are in grades 6 through 8. A fencer in Middle School CANNOT fence in a High School competition until they are in 9th grade.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be USA Fencing members. A non-competitive ($10) membership is required at a minimum. \r\n\r\nRequired Equipment\r\nPlease wear shoes with \"non-marking\" or white soles to all competitions.\r\n\r\nUniform\r\nAt all USFA tournaments the following equipment is required: a full jacket (FIE not required), a plastron, a glove and fencing knickers. Jeans, corduroys, sweatpants or baseball trousers are not permitted. Socks must cover all the leg not covered by the knickers. Women's equipment must include breast protectors made of metal or rigid material inside the jacket. The appropriate glove, lame and mask for the weapon being fenced are required. Fencers must wear a mask with a sewn-in bib that passes the 12K punch test. Names on the uniform are not required for the North Texas Scholastic Fencing League. If the fencer has his\/her name on the jacket or knickers, it should follow the USFA rules: the fencer's last name must be legibly printed on the uniform in dark blue capital letters not more than 10 cm high. The name must be located either (1) on the back of the uniform between the shoulders; (2) on the front or side of the \"rear\" thigh; or (3) on a piece of fabric or lame material that is firmly sewn to the uniform so that it will not catch the opponent's point. Fabric attached to the uniform must be the same color as that part of the uniform. Attached lame material cannot alter the conductivity of the metallic vest or jacket. Names printed on tape are NOT acceptable. The country's colors are not required; if the fencer chooses to use them, FIE rules for country's colors should be followed.\r\n\r\nInspections\r\nMasks, gloves, cords, and lames will be inspected by the armorer. Weapons will be tested on the strip. You will not be allowed to fence with weapons that do not conform to USA Fencing standards. \r\n\r\nFormat\r\nThere will be one round of pools with 100% advancing to direct elimination in all individual competitions. The direct elimination bouts will be fifteen touch bouts.\r\n \r\nA team consists of 3 fencers and a possible alternate. Team competitions are a round robin if there are four or fewer teams. If there are more than four teams in the competition, the team tableau is used, with each place fenced off. Team competitions use the NCAA team match format of a five-touch bout between each member of both teams, for 9 bouts. All 9 five-touch bouts are fenced. \r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info: -------------------\r\nTournament: North Texas High School Championship Tournament\r\n\r\nDate: 04\/11\/2020\r\n\r\nLocation:\r\nFencing Institute of Texas\r\n1000 West Crosby Road, Suite 134\r\nCarrollton, Texas 75006\r\n(972) 242-0399\r\n\r\nFees:\r\n$20 Registration\r\n$20 Per Event\r\n$40 per Team\r\n\r\nEVENTS\r\nSaturday 04\/11\/2020\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at times listed below.\r\nHigh School Men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foil\t                9:00 am\r\nHigh School Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foil\t        10:00 am\r\nHigh School Men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foil Team \t12:00 pm\r\nHigh School Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foil Team\t 1:00 pm\r\nMiddle School Men\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foil\t         2:00 pm\r\nMiddle School Women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Foil\t         2:30 pm\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=46244\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/10\/2020\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 12:00 PM (NOON) check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18).

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Fencers who are age eligible for Y10 and Y12 should only register for ONE of the age groups.***\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful.\r\n\r\nThe last of the series will be held June 6th.\r\n\r\nFencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver (attached) to participate. All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome! Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\nFor additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\nBrenda Waddoups\r\nFencing Institute of Texas, Inc\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=45775\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/24\/2020\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
