Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n =====================================================================================\r\n Withdrawal during tournament: \r\n =====================================================================================\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n ====================================\r\n TOURNAMENT PREPARATION GUIDES\r\n ====================================\r\n These guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments.\r\n\r\n Beginner's Tournament Guide http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html (courtesy of fencing.net)\r\n Parents Guide to Fencing: http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html (courtesy of Fencing.net)\r\n USA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n =========================\r\n VENUE\r\n =========================\r\n\r\n GRAND RAPIDS FENCING ACADEMY\r\n\r\n 1345 Monroe Av NW, Suite #102, Grand Rapids, MI 49505\r\n\r\n FREE Wi-Fi\r\n FREE Parking\r\n Plenty of parking on ample parking lot.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.grfencing.com\/location\r\n\r\n =============================\r\n NEARBY HOTELS\r\n =============================\r\n Grand Rapids Fencing Academy located in the prime area of city of Grand Rapids.

We intend to host one each month through Wheelchair Championships and Summer Nationals as warm-ups.  We will be adjusting things as we learn how such things go, so join in and help us develop!\r\n\r\nWeapons check will be available for your peace of mind, but not required.  800 Newton Saber gloves are required for sanctioned events\r\n\r\nUtah Swords Academy hosts the Utah Fencing Foundation's wheelchair fencing program and, after separate warmups and drills, we routinely rotate all students to fence seated with our wheelchair fencers.  For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs.  Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated.  If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get really good with blade-work.   Visualize every bout starting with you being backed up to the end of the strip.  Try it - you'll like it!  Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.  \r\n  ","venue":{"name":"Utah Swords Academy Fencing Club","address":"3536 South West Temple","city":"Salt Lake City","state":"UT","zip":"84115","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":40.6945331,"longitude":-111.8949921,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":12,"name":"Utah-Southern Idaho","abbrev":"UT-SID","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":156908,"tournament_id":39398,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #7, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Any-Age, Walk and Roll Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"Any-Age, Walk and Roll","close_of_reg":"2018-02-10T11:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":156909,"tournament_id":39398,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #7, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-10T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":156910,"tournament_id":39398,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #7, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed #1 \"U\" only sanctioned Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"#1 \"U\" only sanctioned","close_of_reg":"2018-02-10T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158425,"tournament_id":39398,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #7, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed #2 \"U\" only sanctioned Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"#2 \"U\" only sanctioned","close_of_reg":"2018-02-10T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158426,"tournament_id":39398,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #7, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed #3 \"U\" only sanctioned Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"#3 \"U\" only sanctioned","close_of_reg":"2018-02-10T15:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158431,"tournament_id":39398,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #7, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-10T09:45:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158432,"tournament_id":39398,"tournament":"Walk & Roll Saber #7, Youth & Senior Saber","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-02-10T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":38383,"name":"San Bernardino Division 3-Weapon Open","start_date":"2018-02-10","end_date":"","comments":"$10 per weapon.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list using the link in your confirmation email. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>$60 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 2\/7\/18.

If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up.

We're aiming for the tournament to end around 7 or 8 pm.\r\n\r\nThere will be some national-level referees present, but we will likely ask for some self-refereeing throughout the day.\r\n\r\n********LOCATION********\r\nThe tournament is being held in the Clark Gym, NOT in the Gordon Field House, where we have held our previous tournaments. Please refer to the following map: http:\/\/imgur.com\/97QvCYt\r\n\r\nREGARDING SHOES - no black\/hard-soled shoes allowed. Please remove winter boots in the foyer, or at the very least avoid stepping into the fencing area so we can keep the strips dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n********FORMAT AND RULES********\r\nEpee: The format follows the standard NCAA dual meet format, with a round robin. Each match is won by a majority of 5 point bouts, but all 9 bouts will be fenced.\r\n\r\nFoil\/sabre: First round will be 2 pools (of 4 and 5 respectively), following the listed format for epee. Second round is Direct Elimination with 45-pt relays\r\n\r\nWe will adjust the format based on the number of teams registered. If there are four or fewer teams, we will add a round of relays. We have also done pools to Direct Elimination in the past for an unexpectedly large group of teams.\r\n\r\nLong pants are required, but jeans or similarly stiff pants are not allowed. Plastrons and foil bibs are also required.\r\n\r\nIf you have any extra fencers, or not enough for a team, email fencing@rit.edu, and we can probably put together a mixed team.\r\n\r\n\r\nOpen and free for spectators. Interpreting services provided upon request. Please visit MyAccess.rit.edu one to two weeks in advance to request services. If you do not have an RIT login, contact us and we will request one for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n********HISTORY********\r\nSean T. Horan founded the RIT Fencing Club in 2001 with the assistance of Dr. Carl Lutzer. Fencing for almost 20 years, Sean has coached students to national medals in all three weapons, as well as international sabre competitions. Passionate about a positive club community and mathematics, Sean's establishment of RITFC over 15 years ago has allowed for countless students to discover fencing. He continues to be a friend and mentor to the club from afar, in Irvine, CA. We're excited to celebrate our history with this tournament, as Sean says \"team fencing is like my favorite thing in the entire world.\" We look forward to seeing you, at the 3rd Annual Sean T.

Directors are used to this and will not scratch your bouts if you're fencing in the other event; however, fencing in two events is your choice - please be ready to fence a few bouts in a row if need be to keep your events moving.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry & Eligibility\r\n$45 pre-registered and prepaid on AskFred. NO REFUNDS! If you prepay on Fred and need to withdraw for any reason, you must notify us via e-mail (info@brooklynfencing.com) by midnight on Friday, 9\/29, to receive a credit for a future event.

For the $25 one-day membership option, you MUST complete the membership online at usfencing.org ahead of time and bring your e-mail confirmation with you.\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y12 points will be allowed to fence Y14.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Metropolitan Division sanctioned event. Ratings will be awarded where earned.  However, note that for youth events, a C or higher event rating is necessary for classifications to be earned.\r\n\r\n\r\nCompetition Format\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination\r\n\r\nEvents may be split into separate M\/W if we have 6 fencers of both genders present for the same category; unclassified will be split into two or three separate events either M\/W or mixed events depending on day-of attendance.  \r\n\r\nLOCATION 600 Degraw Street (between 3rd & 4th Ave) Second Floor - Closest train is the R at Union Street, three blocks away.
