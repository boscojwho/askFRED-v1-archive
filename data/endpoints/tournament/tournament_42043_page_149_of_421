It's quite possible that we will have one or more pools with 4 fencers. If this is the case, I want to have two rounds of pools, so those 4 fences are not limited to 3 pool bouts.

We may consider two rounds of pools if we wind up with only 8-9 fencers. If we have two rounds of pools, the fencers will be re-seeded for the second round, based on the results of the first round.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73944,"tournament_id":17576,"tournament":"Y10 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-04-14T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17837,"name":"Swords & Strategy Epee Open","start_date":"2012-04-14","end_date":"","comments":"Come for the fencing AND the snacks.  \r\n\r\nStart at 11 AM.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73958,"tournament_id":17590,"tournament":"Div. 3 Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":27,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-04-15T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":18368,"name":"Veteran's Combined Saber","start_date":"2012-04-15","end_date":"","comments":"Rising Stars Fencing Academy Saber Vet Combined Tournament will takes place on Sunday April 15th, 2012 @ 10:30 am.\r\n$35 if you pre-register (pay at the door)\r\n$40 walk in (pay at the door)","prereg_open":"2012-03-30","prereg_close":"2012-04-14","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Rising Stars Fencing Academy (RSFA) Saber Vet Combined\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nVet Combined Mixed Saber 10:30 AM Sun\r\n$35 if you pre-register \r\n$40 walk in\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 03\/30\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/14\/2012.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"RSFA","address":"195 Paterson Avenue","city":"Little Falls","state":"NJ","zip":"07242","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":40.886311,"longitude":-74.222442,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":76787,"tournament_id":18368,"tournament":"Veteran's Combined Saber","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Saber","short_name":"VCmMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"35.00"}]},{"id":17611,"name":"Unrated Epee Tournament","start_date":"2012-04-15","end_date":"","comments":"USFA sanctioned tournament.

Each weapon squad (epee, sabre, foil) in each gender must win 5 of 9 bouts to win; each gender team must win 14 of 27 bouts to win, and the team with 28 or more total victories takes the overall combined men's\/women's 6-weapon team crown.\r\n\r\nThe British Royal Marines will be a special guest and will field a foil squad to compete against the foil squads from Army & Navy.  Those matches will be in Olympic format, scored on a 45-touch relay.\r\n\r\nThe men's events are tentatively scheduled to begin at 1:00 PM and conclude at roughly 2:30 PM.  The women's events are scheduled to begin immediately after the conclusion of the men's events.\r\n\r\nThis will be a great opportunity for people to see a collegiate fencing meet close to home and, most importantly, support the future leaders and officers of our armed forces!\r\n\r\nSome U.S. Olympians will be refereeing, including Ivan Lee (2004) and David Micahnik (1960, 1964, 1968; and US Fencing Hall of Fame).\r\n\r\nBob Campbell, a member of the Philly Pops and co-owner of IQnection (a local web design, marketing, and hosting company) will be performing the National Anthem.\r\n\r\nThere is NO ENTRY FEE.

No petition may contravene the results of a qualifying competition \u0096 a fencer who has fenced in the qualifying competition without withdrawing due to valid medical reasons cannot then petition to disregard or override those results.\r\n\r\nThe following criteria and procedures are applicable to filing a petition:\r\nA petition may be filed by a fencer who qualified (by means of competition or petition) to that same competition in the prior season or whose competitive record during the current fencing season indicates a strong possibility that the athlete would have qualified had they been able to compete in the qualifying competition but:\r\n1. Was unable to compete in the qualifying competitions this season, OR\r\n2. Did compete and had to withdraw because of a disabling injury or illness.\r\n(Note: Mere attendance at an out-of-town school during the qualifying competition shall not constitute inability to compete.)\r\nAll petitions must be made in writing to:\r\n<b>USA FENCING National Events\r\n1 Olympic Plaza\r\nColorado Springs, CO 80909-5774 <\/b>\r\nSuch petitions are to be filed within <b>five business days following the competition at which the petitioner could have qualified<\/b>. Relief from this deadline will be granted only when the specific qualifying competition is held less than two weeks prior to the entry deadline. Under no circumstances will petitions be accepted if received after the entry deadline for the Championships.\r\n\r\nThe petition must be accompanied by:\r\n<ul><li>A non-refundable fee of $100.00, payable to USA FENCING;\r\n<li>A written statement that gives the specific details of the dates, reason for absence or withdrawal, and other pertinent facts. Written notice from the attending physician and\/or statement from the Bout Committee must\r\nsubstantiate any medical reasons if the medical reason required withdrawal from the qualifying competition.\r\n<li>A summary of the fencer's significant competitive results during the past year. In particular, results in previous National Championships and recent North American Cup (NAC) competitions should be noted.\r\n<li>Evidence that a copy of the petition has been submitted to the Chair or Secretary of the Division that hosted the qualifying competition. If the basis for the petition does not correspond with information available to the Division officer, then USA FENCING expects the officer to so notify the national office in writing.\r\n<li>A completed entry form for the USA Fencing National Championships with the correct registration and entry fees or receipt indicating entry was submitted online. If the petition is not approved, these fees associated with the entry will be refunded.\r\n<li>Inclusion of a fax back sheet for reply to the petition if athlete does not have a current e-mail address; otherwise responses to the petition will be made by mail.\r\n<li>Petitions that do not meet these requirements will not be considered.\r\n<li>Decisions on petitions will be based upon the validity of reasons given for absence or withdrawal and the probability that the fencer would have qualified had they competed in the qualifying competition to its conclusion, based on results achieved in other competitions.

(Fees waived for you for that event, but please still preregister on Askfred by the deadline. Please consult with bout committee at check-in to see if your presence will be needed.) Registration fees are non-refundable, but the per-event fees will not be charged if an event is not fenced.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. \r\n\r\nEach fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body cords\/head cords. Please make sure your equipment and lame (if needed) are in good working order prior to the event, as all equipment must pass inspection in order to fence. Weapons are checked on the strip.\r\n\r\nNote: USA Fencing has NOT yet adopted the electric foil mask bib for non-national events, so \"standard\" foil\/epee masks may be used. Fencers may wear masks with the new bib, but they may not use tape to cover the conductive part (for safety reasons.) Note: If you fence at the SNQ you will be required to use the new electric foil mask bib.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: Oregon Division Summer National Qualifiers\r\nDate(s): 04\/21\/2012 - 04\/22\/2012\r\nLocation: NorthWest Fencing Center\r\nFor directions, visit http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=17535\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/13\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73948,"tournament_id":17580,"tournament":"Y12 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-04-21T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":18384,"name":"Indiana Division Qualifiers","start_date":"2012-04-21","end_date":"","comments":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifiers for Div II\/III and Y14 events in conjunction with the Firebird Cup.","prereg_open":"2012-04-04","prereg_close":"2012-04-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"The 2012 Indiana Division Summer National Qualifiers are open to Indiana Division USFA members only.\r\n\r\nPlease see the USFA Athlete Handbook for qualification paths and requirements. \r\n\r\nThere is NO walk-in registration for this tournament.\r\n\r\nEvents will be fenced ONLY if there are more than three competitors.
