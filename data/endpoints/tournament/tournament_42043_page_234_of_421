Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0974096,"longitude":-75.1452389,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113934,"tournament_id":28768,"tournament":"FAP-North Div3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":18,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-02-08T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28815,"name":"Bergen-Passaic Frosh-Soph Tournament","start_date":"2015-02-08","end_date":"","comments":"This is the Bergen Passaic Fencing League's Freshman\/Sophomore Tournament.

The tournament will follow the typical USFA format. Fencer\u0092s will be initially seeded and broken up into pools. The fencers will then be placed into a tournament bracket and will compete until one fencer emerges as the winner. Medals will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, & 3rd place.\r\n\r\nFencers will also earn points based on where they finish in the event. The three best finishes from each competitor will be added together to create the overall score. The three competitors with the highest point totals will receive additional awards following the completion of the fourth event. This format favors not just the most skilled fencer, but also the most consistent and the most dedicated. The more events you fence, the better shot you have of taking home the grand prize.\r\n\r\nThe overall leader will be declared the Epee Grand Champion and will receive a custom-made championship belt to honor their achievement. \r\nPoints will be awarded as follows:\r\nEach direct elimination bout victory earns 3 points\r\nEach direct elimination bout loss earns 1 point\r\n\r\nONLY YOUR THREE BEST TOURNAMENT FINISHES WILL BE COUNTED TOWARDS YOUR OVERALL SCORE.\r\n\r\nThis is a non-USFA event. Masks will be the only equipment checked prior to the start of competition. All fencers must wear full fencing gear including knickers and a plastron. We will not be requiring two weapons and two bodycords for each competitor, but we do request that you bring enough working equipment to see you through the end of the event. Weights and shims will be tested during the tournament to insure fairness. We will have the proper testing equipment on site, and recommend testing before the event. The event will be self-refereed by competitors designated before the start of competition.\r\n\r\nWe will have at least 5 fully operational electric strips on hand in order to insure that this event is completed in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on: 09\/26\/2014\r\nPreregistration closes on: 02\/08\/2015\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"En Garde Fencing Club","address":"352 Butler Street","city":"Etna","state":"PA","zip":"15223","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.496241,"longitude":-79.94392,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":32,"name":"Western Pennsylvania","abbrev":"WPA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":110939,"tournament_id":28053,"tournament":"The En Garde Epee Championship Series: February","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":13,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-02-08T17:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27543,"name":"San Diego Cup - Y10, Y12, Y14, Jr. Sabre","start_date":"2015-02-08","end_date":"","comments":"Official San Diego Cup event.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Photography, filming, recording, or any other form of media of the athlete during the tournament can be used by NJFA and the USFA. Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.**\r\n\r\nNJFA is a member of the NJ Division of the USFA http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 2\/11\/15.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

But there are numerous restaurants within a short drive including Vietnam Town, an Asian themed shopping district with many fine restaurants and \"Plant Shopping Center\", your familiar large outdoor mall.\r\n\r\nAuto Parking: TFC has 50 parking spots. Street parking in the area is possible. But the curb directly in front of the building is a bicycle lane and tickets are issued for parking there. The Walmart Market just down the street has graciously allowed us to use their parking lot. Google indicates that they are approximately a 4 minute walk from TFC. Please park toward the street and avoid their customers or the north wall where their associates park. It is suggested that fencers be dropped off with their gear at the front of the venue before parking cars. Note that the Walmart is a grocery outlet and carries full line of sport drinks, fruits and snacks. Here is a google map of the path between:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.google.com\/maps\/dir\/1290+S+1st+St,+San+Jose,+CA+95110\/1450+Monterey+Rd,+San+Jose,+CA+95112\/@37.3165423,-121.8749931,18z\/data=!3m1!4b1!4m13!4m12!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e3336e837a029:0xc08f514c16f3af27!2m2!1d-121.87484!2d37.31803!1m5!1m1!1s0x808e333a0fcdf2ef:0x74aabb5554e3fdf9!2m2!1d-121.8724699!2d37.3150503\r\n\r\nHotels: TFC is within easy reach of downtown San Jose and its numerous hotels by car\/taxi\/bus. But for convenience we recommend \"The Elan\" which is only a few hundred feet away. It is a two star, no frills but clean and tidy motel which is generally available on weekends. http:\/\/www.hotelelansanjose.com\/\r\ncontact organizers if you want more
