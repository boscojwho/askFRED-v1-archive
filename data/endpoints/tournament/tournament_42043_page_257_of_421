That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event.

We DO NOT take credit\/debit cards.\r\n\r\nRegistration fees are non-refundable, but the per-event fees will not be charged if an event is not fenced.\r\n\r\nYou may join or renew your membership at the door, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership. If you join\/renew online, please bring a copy of your membership receipt as proof of membership. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. \r\n\r\nEach fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body cords. Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event, as all equipment must pass inspection in order to fence. We anticipate that we will offer an opportunity to get your equipment tested the night before the event. Weapons are checked on the strip. Foil events use a conductive mask.\r\n\r\nWe need volunteers for this event, so please contact the tournament organizers if you can help a shift. Also, healthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area.\r\n\r\nThe USFA Board of Directors has adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. Certain aspects of the SafeSport policy may be modified by the USFA Board of Directors in September. We will provide updates as we get more information. Feel free to contact any of the Division Officers if you have questions.\r\n\r\nCome support our kids, families, and sport and eat with us! And thank you for signing up for this event!\r\n\r\n---------- Venue Information ----------\r\n\r\nThe event will be held at: Northwest Fencing Center, 4950 SW Western Ave, Beaverton, OR

Our goal is to create a positive tournament experience and setting for every fencer, while providing a level of professionalism expected of an elite fencing center.\r\n\r\nThe SFSFL incorporates two Circuits within its infrastructure, The Junior & Open Circuit (JOC) and The Individual Challenge Circuit (ICC).  The JOC is for fencers ages 13 & above; all competitions in this circuit are Nationally Sanctioned Events and are eligible for USA Fencing Ratings.  The ICC is geared towards the development of the complete fencer; recreational youth and adult, beginner and novice, and the competitive fencer.  These events are considered exhibitions with complete USA Fencing tournament conditions.\r\n\r\nAll SFSFL events have a full seasonal ranking system in place.  These ranking systems mirror that of the National Governing Body, USA Fencing, and the International Governing Body, Federation International de\u0092 Escrime (FIE).  Each tournament in the JOC will award fencers in the final four with medals.  Each tournament in the ICC will award the final eight fencers with medals.  These circuits also provide seasonal awards for Overall Ranking Champions and Individual Champions, as well as MVP, Coaches Awards, etc.\r\n\r\nEVENTS INCLUDE:\r\nOpen Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nJunior Mixed Sabre (JOC)\r\nDivision-3 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-12 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-10 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\nYouth-8 Mixed Sabre (ICC)\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE: (all times = close of registration)\r\nSaturday:\r\n2pm \u0096 Division-3 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-8 Mixed Sabre\r\nSunday:\r\n10am \u0096 Open Mixed Sabre\r\n10am \u0096 Youth-12 Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Junior Mixed Sabre\r\n2pm \u0096 Youth-10 Mixed Sabre\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\nSabre Outreach Network\r\nDuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center\r\n3017 NW 60th St\r\nFort Lauderdale, FL  33308\r\n\r\nFOR MORE INFORMATION:\r\n954-990-0090\r\nMitchB5659@comcast.net\r\nDan.Berliner@hotmail.com\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/28\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/13\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"DuelLIFE Olympic Fencing Center","address":"3017 NW 60th St","city":"Fort Lauderdale","state":"FL","zip":"33309","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":26.2007656,"longitude":-80.1860775,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":120276,"tournament_id":30560,"tournament":"Holiday Challenge - SFSFL #4","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":0,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-12T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120277,"tournament_id":30560,"tournament":"Holiday Challenge - SFSFL #4","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y8MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-12T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120278,"tournament_id":30560,"tournament":"Holiday Challenge - SFSFL #4","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":40,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120279,"tournament_id":30560,"tournament":"Holiday Challenge - SFSFL #4","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120280,"tournament_id":30560,"tournament":"Holiday Challenge - SFSFL #4","full_name":"Junior Mixed Saber","short_name":"JrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":34,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-13T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":120281,"tournament_id":30560,"tournament":"Holiday Challenge - SFSFL #4","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-13T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29793,"name":"2nd Annual December Decapitation","start_date":"2015-12-12","end_date":"","comments":"Fun & friendly.

Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nThe Y10\/Y12 event is for fencers born in 2003 or later. All other events are for fencers born in 2002 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. The Div III event is for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2015-2016) competitive members of the USFA or CFF. All fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $45 per team (including sales tax). There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=31383\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/11\/2015\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event.

Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.\r\n\r\nCFC is a member of the CT Division of the USFA \r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nCFC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at:http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 3 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 32 fencers (16 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 12\/13\/15.

PLEASE READ!!!!!!!!!!\r\n\r\n800N Saber Glove Mandatory for All USA Fencing Sanctioned Tournaments Beginning on Oct. 1, 2015\r\n \r\nIn conjunction with the updated amendments to the Federation Internationale d'Escrime Rules, the USA Fencing Board of Directors has voted to mandate that all saber athletes must use a glove that meets the protection requirements listed below in all USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments beginning on Oct. 1, 2015.\r\n\r\n    The material of the fencing glove must have a level of protection of 800N on the areas shown in the diagram below, the seams a minimum strength of 200N and cuff a level of protection of 350N. The conductive material which can be removable or fixed must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n     \r\n    The conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\n    In order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\n    The conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION INFORMATION, DEADLINES, COSTS:\r\n\r\n Registration fees (including all convenience fees and costs to register online and pay with a credit card) follow, with listed deadlines:\r\n\r\n ---Regular online registration period runs through 11\/30\/2015 \/till 11:59pm\/\r\n $30 Non refundable registration plus $40 per event \r\n\r\n---DOUBLE FEE-From December 1 till December 6 \/till 11.59pm\/\r\n $ 60 Non refundable registration plus $ 80 per event\r\n\r\n --- TRIPLE FEE-From December 7\/2015 through December 14\/ 2015\r\n $90 registration plus $120 per event\r\n\r\n*REFUND:\r\nDeadline for REFUND request is on Friday, December 4\/2015 @ 11:59 pm.\r\nPlease make a separate email with \"REFUND\" as the subject.\r\nMake sure that you include your mailing address in the email.\r\nRefund will be sent 2 weeks after the tournament.\r\n\r\nPLEASE REED:\r\n\r\nAt this time, Askfred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament.
