The objective is to provide youth (y8, y10, y12 and y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in y8, y10, y12 and\/or y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of escrimeur youth cup points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCalculations\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of points (mxpnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge group     mxpnts\r\n  y8\t       50\r\n  y10\t       50\r\n  y12\t      100\r\n  y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of evntxratio:\r\n\r\nEvntxratio = nentrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((nentrs - pl + 1) \/ nentrs) x mxpnts x evntxratio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned points for escrimeur youth cup series will be a sum of all points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net by midnight on sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net starting monday through midnight on saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks, venmo or zelle for payments made at the door.

BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).\r\n\r\n$80 at the door for late registrations (after Tues, 2\/7) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY).\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.<\/b>\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\n<b>All USA Fencing rules, including those pertaining to attire and equipment will be enforced.

You can practice epee, foil, or both (same cost but I can include you in both round robin tables). Sign up for the weapon(s) you wish to practice so others can know who will be present. Or you can use this time to practice paired drills or some new strategies\/tactics. This is an unsanctioned session so you cannot earn a rating for particiating. There will be no medals. Fence as many people as you like. Or use this time as a practice session with a partner to improve some problem solving skills. This will be self-refereed, and if you have questions about rules, Coach Toby will be availalbe Coach Toby will be supervising and giving tips during this time. The goal of this 2 hour practice session is to improving strategies and tactics.\r\n\r\nCOST\r\nRound robin \/ open fencing self-refereed session for practice from 3 PM to 5 PM is $20 if you are not participating in the earlier clinic.
