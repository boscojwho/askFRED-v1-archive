During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2005-20010) and Senior (2004 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 24 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates for the 2017-2018 events:\r\nAugust 26, 2017\r\nOctober 28, 2017\r\nNovember 18, 2017\r\nJanuary 20, 2017\r\nMarch 3, 2018\r\nApril 14, 2018\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462291,"longitude":-97.2377284,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151008,"tournament_id":37999,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #3","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T15:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151009,"tournament_id":37999,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #3","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T12:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151010,"tournament_id":37999,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #3","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-18T18:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":38768,"name":"2017 Turkey of a Tournament","start_date":"2017-11-18","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for this near Thanksgiving Tradition.

Current ratings can be verified here: https:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/search\/members  Current points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n1.  Current national Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC\r\n2.  Letter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3.  Athletes with neither of the above are seeded in a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event (i.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc). \r\n\r\n<b>FORMAT:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll events will have one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau.

Pre-registration will not be complete until payment is received; NO payments accepted the day of the tournament). Pre-registering for an event without payment is NOT considered a valid pre-registration. Pre-registration is ONLY valid once payment is received.\r\n\r\nNO EXCEPTIONS!

The Registration fee ($15) will NOT be refunded, however the event fees ($10) will be refunded ONLY if requested in writing and received by 11\/26\/17 (one week after the event). \r\n\r\nFencers MUST be Citizen or Permanent Resident (proof required).

(For instance, a fencer with Y14 points will be allowed to fence Cadet.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and Tennessee Division Sanctioned event; ratings will be awarded where earned. Cadet events must be rated as a C1 or greater for any classifications to be awarded.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION FORMAT:\r\n\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination.\r\n\r\nQUALIFYING:\r\n\r\nThe top 25% (round up) of the field in an event will qualify for the Jr. Olympics in that event.  \r\n\r\nIf a fencer qualifies in the Jr. Event for one weapon, they will also qualify for the Cadet Event in that same weapon (ONLY if they are age eligible to compete in the Cadet category).\r\n\r\nWhen determining who has qualified for a Championship, only fencers who qualify through\r\nNational Points are skipped over to the next eligible fencer. Fencers that qualify for championships\r\nvia regional points are NOT skipped over. Those who qualify through the division should NOT be skipped.\r\nFor example, if a fencer competes and qualifies in a Junior division qualifier and is age eligible for Cadet,\r\nhe\/she will NOT get skipped over if they choose to also fence in the Cadet division qualifier. Those who\r\nqualify for Div IA, Div II, or Div III by earning regional ROC points are NOT considered automatic qualifiers at divisional qualifiers and should NOT be skipped over. \r\n\r\nUNIFORMS & EQUIPMENT:\r\n\r\nFencers are required to have complete fencing uniforms as required by USA Fencing. This includes the following items: Mask with two retaining devices aka straps (foil masks must have a conductive bib as now required), mask cord (foil\/saber), jacket, plastron (underarm protector), knickers, lam\u00e9 (foil\/saber), glove (800N saber), tall socks (must overlap knickers, proper footwear (no sandals, boots, heeled shoes, etc.), two working body cords and two working electric weapons.\r\n\r\nWeights (foil\/epee) and shims (epee) will be tested!\r\nMasks, lames, gloves, saber cuffs, body cords, head cords will we tested\/checked! \r\n\r\nFor more info about the Junior Olympics, see the USA Fencing page here: http:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/2018-junior-olympics\r\n\r\nAny questions should be directed to the TN Division Chairman, Robert Piraino for clarification.

There are no national points awarded at RJCC competitions; please refer to Chapter 3 for more information on the Regional Point structure. The Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is a ranking program designed to recognize and reward both participation and accomplishment at the RJCC Tournament level.\r\n\r\nRegional Point Standings for Youth, Cadet and Junior reflect an athlete\u0092s results at RYC and\/or RJCC tournaments within their home region (based on division affiliation). These point standings are posted online and are updated within five business days after the tournament organizer has properly submitted results, event officials form, membership forms and paid the program service fee. For more information on this point system please visit \u0096\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/2292457-regional. These point standings are not used for seeding, only National Point Standings are used for seeding at regional tournaments.\r\n\r\nFencers only earn points at RJCCs within their home region (region is assigned based on division affiliation). The best 2 results count towards the point total. These points may qualify Cadet and Junior fencers to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and July Challenge. Points earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of National Point Standings, for seeding or team selection purposes; they are only reflected in Regional Point Standings. Using the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants: ((#entries \u0096 place +1) \/ # entries) x 100 points The winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of the region. Regional RJCC points are only\r\nearned in the fencers own region.\r\n\r\nThe Cadet Regional Tournament is offered as part of the Regional Junior Cadet Circuit (RJCC). No national points are awarded; regional points are awarded to any competitor competing in their home region. Regional points are awarded based on final placement and the size of the competitive field.\r\n\r\n\r\nCadet & Junior \u0096 Junior Olympic Fencing Championships\r\nThe JOs are held each February on President\u0092s weekend.\r\n\r\nA.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (maufrich@hotmail.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (maufrich@hotmail.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7663036,"longitude":-73.9792973,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151319,"tournament_id":38099,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #2 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":22,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-11-19T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":38122,"name":"MD Division U17 Jr Olympic Qualifier Sabre","start_date":"2017-11-19","end_date":"","comments":"This is the MD Division qualifier for Junior Olympics. - MD Div members only - top 25% qualify (min of 3 per event). \r\nYou must preregister by 11\/13 for this event.

During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Seeding for SYC pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification.  Cadet pools will be seeded according to letter ranking with year classification. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date.  \r\n\r\nFencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.   Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list.

All entrants' age\/point eligibility will be verified prior to the tournament, and any ineligible fencers will be notified and removed from the \"who's preregistered\" list. \r\n\r\n<b>Age Eligibility\r\n===========<\/b>\r\nROC : Born 2004 or earlier\r\nCADET: 2001-2004\r\nJUNIOR: 1998-2004\r\n\r\nException to Age Eligibility\r\n- Cadet (through JO's): A fencer born after 2004 can fence in Cadet local and regional competitions, NAC Cadet tournaments and Junior Olympic Cadet Fencing Championships and qualifying tournaments IF the fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the entry deadline for that tournament.\r\n- Junior (through JO's): A fencer born after 2004 can fence in Junior local and regional competitions, NAC Junior and Junior Olympic Junior Fencing Championships and qualifying tournaments IF the fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the entry deadline for that tournament.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Staff\r\n==============<\/b>\r\nBout Committee Chair: Rasha Abdellatif \r\nHead Referee: Fernando Delgado\r\nReferees Assigners: Fernando Delgado and Abdel Aziz\r\nMedical: Adam, Sturavant, MD\r\nHead Armor: Chris Green\r\nEquipment Vendor: Blue Gauntlet Fencing Gear http:\/\/www.blue-gauntlet.com \r\nOfficial Merchandiser: Lamsah Custom Printing http:\/\/lamsah.us \r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format and Rules\r\n=========================<\/b>\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\nEquipment check required (mask, lame (as appropriate), gloves, sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords).

Points earned in a ROC tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Div 1A do NOT trickle down to Div 2).\r\n- There IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION between Div 1A and Div 2\/Div 3. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in Div 1A and is age and classification eligible for Div 2 (Div 3), they earn qualification in that category as well.\r\n\r\n<b>Points for RJCC\r\n=============<\/b>\r\n-\tAll athletes whose USA Fencing's membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For more information on this Regional Points formula see the Regional Recognition Initiative Document available http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources\r\n-\tUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer's Regional Rank each season.\r\n-\tThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional points do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\n-\tThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet, he\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\n-\tThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events. Junior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and Junior Olympic\/National Championships.\r\n\r\n<b>Host Hotel\r\n=========<\/b>\r\n<b><I>Embassy Suites by Hilton East Peoria Riverfront Hotel & Conference Center<\/b><\/I>\r\nAddress: 100 Conference Center Dr, East Peoria, IL 61611\r\nPhone:(309) 694-0200\r\n*Magnificent newly built hotel with specious two-rooms suites.\r\n*Complimentary delicious made-to-order breakfast buffet.\r\n*Complimentary drinks and refreshments at Evening Reception.\r\n*Lush green open-air atrium lobby.\r\n*Free parking.\r\n*Free Wi-Fi.\r\n\r\nRate is $122.0 + tax.

This means that these events are NR until they achieve C1 level or higher. See USA Fencing ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\n\r\n\u0095 SYC Competitions award national points to the top 40% of the field. \r\n\u0095 CADET events are non-regional events and are not a qualifying path.  \r\n\r\n\u0095 Format for all events is one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. \r\n\r\nPools: All events will use pools of six or seven whenever possible. In events with fewer than 11 entrants, the BC may elect to have two rounds of pools followed by 100% promoted to a DE (direct elimination) tableau. There is no fence-off for third place. One preliminary round of pools is comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to DE round. DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Fencers are seeded by their results in the pool round wherein the results of fencers in all the pools are ordered by best results to poorest results: highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received.\r\n\r\n<I>Y8\/Y10 DE format: <\/I>10-touch bouts (two 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break  between). The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n<I>Y12\/Y14 DE format: <\/I> 15-touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break between) During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n<i>Cadet DE format: <\/i>15 touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute break between). During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Seeding for SYC pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification.  Cadet pools will be seeded according to letter ranking with year classification. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date.  \r\n\r\nFencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.   Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list.  Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during tournament: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n<b>QUALIFICATION

It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  No Y12 fencers in the team event, sorry.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  If we have a lot of people signed up we may use some imagination in the format; last year, for example, we ran a pool of teams, each round to a multiple of 3 rather than 5, each round to a max of 1 minute rather than 3.  At any rate, it will be a lot of fencing but will not go on until midnight.  \r\n\r\nIt's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.
