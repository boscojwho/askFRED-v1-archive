Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.

When ALL pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted on-line you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.

When the tournament is uploaded to the event computer, your information will be updated to what is currently in the USFA database. \r\n\r\nFYI: If you are fully registered for the E and under event and earn a higher classification before the Pomme, you may still compete in the event. As long as you are fully registered, earning a higher classification does not disqualify you from competing.\r\n\r\nAlso, DO NOT contact me if you miss a deadline. There are no exceptions for late entries. See #1 below.\r\n\r\nFor any other questions NOT ANSWERED below, please contact:\r\n\r\nmerritt55@comcast.net\r\n\r\nI recommend you read all current info below before contacting me with questions.\r\n\r\nLIVE RESULTS WILL BE ON FENCINGTIMELIVE.COM\r\n\r\nPOMME DE TERRE INDIVIDUAL\r\nBILL HALL VETERAN EVENTS\r\n\r\nNew England Division USFA (NEUSFA) will hold the 35th Annual Pomme de Terre fencing tournament at Brandeis University on June 15 & June 16, 2024.\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ BELOW FOR FAQs and IMPORTANT INFORMATION FOR FOREIGN FENCERS.\r\n\r\n1. NO EXCEPTIONS ARE MADE FOR LATE ENTRY. Please, DO NOT email me with your reason for not registering on time. The answer will not be any different than what is stated here. Your inability to register on time is not my problem. Register early to avoid any issues. Registration without complete payment does not mean you are entered. Register AND COMPLETE PAYMENT before the stated deadlines.\r\n\r\n2. NO WALKINS WILL BE ALLOWED - only preregistered and PAID competitors may fence. \r\n\r\n3. US fencers - you must be current ACCESS or COMPETITIVE MEMBERS of USFA. There are no day memberships and noncompetitive memberships are ineligible. Collegiate members MUST be on their U.S. college\/university official roster. \r\n\r\n4 FOREIGN athletes. We welcome your participation at the PdT; however, you must be a current international member of USFA to compete. Please go to the usafencing.org website\/membership to obtain your international USFA membership. This includes our friends from Canada. \r\n\r\n5. Any FOREIGN national with a world ranking within the last 5 years, at any level, is not allowed to fence in the E and under. No entries will be refunded for any ineligible fencer registering for this event. We will take your money and not give it back.\r\n\r\n6. National point standings DO NOT APPLY at this tournament. If you are underage, you may not participate. See eligibility below.  \r\n\r\n7. BLUE GAUNTLET will be on site for equipment needs. \r\n\r\n8. Medals and potato specific prizes (PSPs) are awarded to top 8 in individual events. If you are unable to stay for the award presentation, you must have someone pick up the medal. No awards will be given out before the presentation. \r\n\r\nFORMAT: Vet and E and Under are 100% promotion from pools to Direct Elimination. Opens are 80% promotion from pools to Direct Elimination. Seeding is by classification only; national point standings are not used. \r\nCurrently, there are no capacity limits; however, we reserve the right to make changes should an epidemic or some other event beyond our control occur. \r\n\r\nREMINDER: Event Restrictions: You may fence in only one individual event per day (exception if also qualified for a Vet event). If you are in two events on the same day, (Vet and individual) you MUST present yourself at the appropriate strip when called. If you register for multiple events on the same day (i.e., different weapons) you will be removed from one and there will be no refund. \r\n\r\nELIGIBILITY\r\n\r\nBirth year 2010 or earlier. In any tournament where children can fence with adults, the fencer must be 13 BEFORE January 1 of the competition season (August - July) i.e., competitor must have turned 13 by Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be a current access or competitive member of the USFA by June 14. Memberships will be checked before the event; if you are not compliant you will receive an email requiring you to join\/renew and bring proof of current membership. No event will be held up because you are not a USFA member at check in. \r\n\r\nCheck in WILL require current USA fencing membership card to be scanned. Printed copy is best option. You can print out your membership card from your USFA profile. Phones do not always work, and you will hold up the line for other competitors. \r\n \r\nCOST\r\nIndividual Events\r\n\r\nEntry Fee Discount per fencer \r\nFeb 1 - Feb 28\r\nRegistration $40.00\r\nEntry $50.00 per event\r\nEARLY REGISTRATION PERIOD HAS CLOSED\r\n\r\nRegular Registration\/Entry Fee\r\nMarch 1 - May 13\r\nRegistration $50.00\r\nEntry Fee $60.00 per event\r\n\r\nLate Registration\/Entry Fee\r\nMay 14 - May 20\r\nRegistration $100.00\r\nEntry Fee $120.00 per event\r\n\r\nTriple Entry Fees (per event)\r\nMay 21 - June 1\r\nRegistration $150.00 \r\nEntry Fee $180.00 per event \r\n\r\nIN CASE YOU MISSED IT ABOVE \u00e2\u0080\u0093 NO LATE ENTRIES OR WALKINS WILL BE ACCEPTED.

Please register in a timely manner to avoid any payment issues on askfred. Again, your inability to register by stated deadlines, is not my problem. Don't wait until the deadline day to register. Make a decision, you are coming or not. \r\n\r\nTo receive a free t-shirt, you must register and pay by June 1. Registering early helps us ensure we have enough qualified referees for this tournament. Please avoid late fees by registering early!
