Fencing should begin approximately 30 minutes after the close of registration.\r\n\r\nIt is anticipated that there will be separate men\u0092s and women\u0092s events in each weapon and each age group.  Events may be combined into one mixed event if there are fewer than 6 fencers of either gender present at the close of registration.\r\n\r\nCost:  $20 registration fee for the first event\t\r\n            $15 registration fee for each additional event\r\n            $10 late fee for registrations received at the door\r\nAll \u0093A\u0094 rated fencers fence for free in their respective events!\r\n\r\nVenue:  Hall-Kent Elementary School gymnasium\r\n\r\nAwards:  To 1st, 2nd and 3rd place. \r\nIf men\u0092s and women\u0092s events are combined for any age groups and\/or weapons, there will be separate awards to the top 3 men and the top 3 women of each age group, based on their placement in the mixed event.  There will be no fence off for third place in any event.                                        \r\n. \r\n\u0095Pre-register online at AskFred.net and look to see who else is coming.  Payment can be made upon arrival.  Pre-registration closes on January 26, 2006.\r\n\u0095All fencers must be current USFA members, and will need to show proof of membership, either by card or by fax from the USFA.  (Alternatively, a fencer may be a member in good standing of another National Federation or a current FIE license holder.)  You may renew your USFA membership or join at the tournament.  Forms will be available at the tournament, or can be downloaded from the USFA website at www.usfencing.org  If you do not have your USFA card with you when checking in, you will be required to complete a new USFA form and pay the annual fee. The form and payment will be returned to you upon proof of USFA membership subsequent to the tournament.  \r\n\u0095Fencers under 18 years of age must have a parent or guardian signature (not a coach) on their USFA membership form (if renewing or joining at the tournament) and on the tournament entry form.\r\n\u0095Mask checks will be performed prior to competition, and there will be weight\/shim tests for all weapons brought onto the fencing strip. You MUST wear a plastron.   No sweatpants will be permitted.\r\n\u0095All USFA rules apply.  At the end of each bout, fencers are required to sign pool sheets and DE slips before leaving the strip. USFA rules will be enforced throughout the competition.  \r\n\u0095Y10 fencers must use blades that are no longer than 32.5\u0094 (i.e., blades that are designated a \"0\" or \"2\" under the internationally recognized lengths). Weapon length will be tested prior to competition. \r\n\u0095Seeding will be based on the following factors in this order:\r\n     -National Rolling Point Standing\r\n     -Classification and year\r\n     -Seeding on a random basis with other athletes with neither National Points nor a weapon classification\r\n\u0095Tournament format will be pools to five points, used to establish seeding to the direct elimination (DE). DE bouts will be conducted as they are at a NAC. For Y10 and Y12, the winner of the DE bouts is the best 2 out of 3 five-touch bouts. For Y14, the DE bouts are 15 touches (three 3-minute periods, with a 1-minute rest between periods).\r\n\u0095To fence Y14, you must have been born in 1991-1994, unless you are on the Y12 national point standings.  To fence Y12, you must have been born in 1993-1996, unless you are on the Y10 national point standings.  To fence Y10, you must have been born in 1995-1998.\r\n\r\nFor additional information, contact Carol Gray Caldwell at CGCwell@aol.com\r\n\r\nDirections to Venue [Hall-Kent Elementary School gymnasium]:  \r\nFrom I-65 heading south, you will take the Lakeshore Boulevard exit, which is about one mile past the Oxmoor Road exit.  At the light at the end of the exit ramp, take a left heading back over I-65.  Go through the first light (which is just an entrance back onto I-65) until you reach the second light at a fairly big intersection (a BP gas station will be on your right).  At this intersection of Lakeshore Boulevard and Greensprings Highway, turn left heading north on Greensprings Highway (toward downtown).  At the second traffic light, turn left onto Raleigh Avenue.  Then turn left at the second stop sign.  The school will be on your left.  The gym entrance is behind the school.\r\n\r\nIf heading north on I-65 (as if coming from Montgomery), the Lakeshore exit will be about one mile past the Alford Avenue exit.  Take a right at the light at the end of the exit ramp.  You will be taking a left at the same Lakeshore\/Greensprings intersection described above (with the BP station on your right).  Continue following the directions to the school as noted above.\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble finding the venue on the day of the tournament, call (205) 410-8183.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the Birmingham Fencing Club and a full schedule of our tournaments for this season, please visit our website at www.fencingclub.org\r\n\r\nFor results from our most recent tournaments, please see our website or see the results listed at www.AskFred.net\r\n \r\nRegional Youth Circuit Fencing Tournament\r\nBirmingham \u0096 Southeast Region\r\nJanuary 28-29, 2006\r\nEntry Form\r\nName___________________________\r\nClub____________________________\r\nAddress_________________________\r\n________________________________\r\nDivision_________________________\t\r\nE-mail___________________________\t\r\n\/ \/ Male\t\/ \/ Female\r\nBirth Date ____________Age________ \r\nUSFA Number_________________\r\n\r\nFEES:  $20 Registration fee for the first event\r\n$15 Registration fee for each additional event\r\n$10 late fee for registrations received at the door\r\nAll \u0093A\u0094 rated fencers fence for free in their respective events\r\n\r\nFoil - rating and year _____\r\nEpee - rating and year_____\r\nSabre - rating and year_____\r\n\r\nEvent (indicate applicable fee):                   \t        \r\nY10 Men\u0092s Foil - $_____\t\t            \r\nY10 Women\u0092s Foil - $_____\t\t\r\nY10 Men\u0092s Epee - $_____\t\t\r\nY10 Women\u0092s Epee - $_____\t\t\r\nY10 Men\u0092s Sabre - $_____\t\t\r\nY10 Women\u0092s Sabre - $_____\t\t\r\nY12 Men\u0092s Foil - $_____\t\t\r\nY12 Women\u0092s Foil - $_____\t\t\r\nY12 Men\u0092s Epee - $_____\t\t\r\nY12 Women\u0092s Epee - $_____\t\t\r\nY12 Men\u0092s Sabre - $_____\t\t\r\nY12 Women\u0092s Sabre - $_____\t\t\r\nY14 Men\u0092s Foil - $_____\t\t\r\nY14 Women\u0092s Foil - $_____\t\t\r\nY14 Men\u0092s Epee - $_____\t\t\r\nY14 Women\u0092s Epee - $_____\t\t\r\nY14 Men\u0092s Sabre - $_____\t\t\r\nY14 Women\u0092s Sabre - $_____\t\t\r\nLate Fee - $_____\r\nTOTAL FEES - $_____\t\r\n\r\nMake checks payable to the Birmingham Fencing Club.\r\nMail or bring to:  Birmingham Fencing Club\r\n\t        1425 Montgomery Hwy., Suite 25\r\n\t        Birmingham, Alabama  35216\r\n\r\nWaiver\r\nI hereby waive and release all rights and claims for damages I may have against the Birmingham Fencing Club, Hall-Kent Elementary School, the United States Fencing Association, the officials, managers, sponsors, and other participants from any and all liabilities arising from illness, losses, injuries or damages I may suffer as a result of my participation in this Regional Youth Circuit fencing tournament.
