The objective is to provide Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers with individual club\r\nfencing qualification based on the series of tournaments throughout 2015-2016 fencing season. Each participant will be awarded with a number of points earned in a specific event at each competition. Each age group belongs to a specific Maximum Points bracket:\r\n\r\nAge Group Max. Points\r\nY10 50\r\nY12 100\r\nY14 200\r\n\r\nThe calculation of the earned Points at each event is as follows:\r\n\r\n((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x Maximum Points\r\n\r\n1st place receives the Maximum Points, while all consecutive places will receive the corresponding Points calculated through the above formula. All points will be rounded-up in case of the results with decimals. Below are several examples:\r\n\r\nY10 event of 10 fencers:\r\n1 = 50\r\n2 = 45\r\n3 = 40\r\n...\r\n10 = 5\r\n\r\nY12 event of 8 fencers:\r\n1 = 100\r\n2 = 88\r\n3 = 75\r\n...\r\n8 = 13\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of earned points for the Cup Series will be a sum of points earned in each competition, but will be limited to a specific age group and a weapon (if a fencer participates in several age group and weapon events).\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords.

If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please register for an additional event in a different category that you ARE age eligible to participate in, and then email the organizers with the name of the athlete, and the events that need to be switched around.

Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing Current points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n1.\tCurrent national Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC\r\n2.\tLetter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3.\tAthletes with neither of the above are seeded in a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event (i.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc). \r\nFORMAT\r\nAll events will have one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau.

Athletes without proof of membership must fill out all appropriate forms to pay for membership. Payment will be returned if membership can be verified.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing is working towards an age verification process. An athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via email, mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the database. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and temporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nThis season, parents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to: information@usfencing.org:\r\n\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\n\r\nYou will not be allowed to fence, no matter what events you participated in last season, without proof of USFA competitive membership and age verification.\r\n\r\n<b>Birth Year Eligibility 2015-2016 season:<\/b>\r\nY10 2005-2008\r\nY12 2003-2006 (or on Y10 NRPS list)\r\nY14 2001-2004 (or on Y12 NRPS list)\r\nJunior (U20) 1996-2002 (or on Cadet NRPS list)\r\n\r\nSpecial Notes about Birth Year vs National Points List to determine Eligibility: \r\n\r\nThe Austin Challenge Region 5 RYC\/RJC uses birth year eligibility for the 2015-2016 season. Age eligibility for events is determined by BIRTH YEAR, not age at time of participation.\r\n\r\nIf you are not eligible by BIRTH YEAR, but have NATIONAL POINTS for the age group younger than the event you want to enter, you are eligible to fence in that age group. \r\n\r\nAt this time, AskFred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible. If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please email the organizers with the name of the athlete, and the events that you want to register for.

Registrations not paid by a registration deadline will be deleted from the askfred fencer list for this tournament. \r\n\r\n<b>EQUIPMENT GUIDELINES<\/b>\r\nStandard fencing uniforms; cannot have any rips, tears, or holes. Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing glove must cover half of the forearm. Names on uniforms are not required per RYC guidelines.\r\nStandard fencing plastron; required with every uniform; women must wear chest protector.\r\nMask: 12K punch test. Sewn-in or channel (Leon Paul X-change style) bib. Conductive Bib in foil is required. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\nThe maximum blade length permitted for Y10 competitions is 32.5 inches. This requirement shall be strictly enforced. Y12, Y14, Junior, and Open competitions, standard blade length of 30-35\u0094 permitted.\r\nAny attachment to a weapon's handle must fix the hand in one position such that the top of the thumb is no more than 2 cm from the inner surface of the guard.\r\nEpee wiring must meet the current standards in effect as of August 1, 2013. For more information, please see http:\/\/www.fencingofficials.org\/blog\/2013\/05\/wiring-epees\/\r\n<b>800N Saber Glove Mandatory for All USA Fencing Sanctioned Tournaments Beginning on Oct. 1, 2015<\/b> \r\nThe material of the fencing glove must have a level of protection of 800N , the seams a minimum strength of 200N and cuff a level of protection of 350N. The conductive material (which can be removable or fixed) must cover all of the gauntlet of the glove down to below the external cubital styloid (small prominent bone of the wrist), both when the fencer is in the 'on-guard' position and when the sword arm is straight. Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.  The conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  In order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  The conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\n \r\n<b>SEEDING<\/b>\r\nSeeding for Youth Events shall be based on the following order:\r\n1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nSeeding for Regional Junior Events will be posted when the Tournament Committee designates how these events will be seeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT FORMAT<\/b>\r\nAll events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per RYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\nNo fence off for 3rd place.\r\nFor Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nFor Y12, Y14 and Junior events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n\r\nRegional Youth and Junior Circuit events serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments, therefore, no events may be combined regardless of number of entrants.\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS<\/b>\r\nPlease see the Athlete Handbook for the latest details on points for Regional Youth and Junior Circuit events, as well as qualifications to National Events\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Round Rock Sports Center","address":"2400

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free onsite parking! Free wireless internet!\r\n\r\n10 minute walk on scenic tow path to historic Lambertville full of shops & dining!\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF. You acknowledge you are entering this tournament at your own risk and release the USFA and its sponsors, BCAF, and referees from any liability. With entry you give consent to BCAF to obtain medical care from any licensed physician, hospital or clinic for any injury or illness that may arise during activities associated with this tournament. **<\/b>\r\n\r\nBCAF Waiting-list policy:\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 32 fencers (per event). If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n$35\/single event; $65\/2 events; $90\/all 3 events! \r\n\r\nWalk-in fee and late registration (after 11\/18\/15), add $10 per event.\r\n\r\n***Cash & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nMIXED VET SABRE: 8:30 AM check-in (closes)\r\nMIXED VET EPEE: 11:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nMIXED VET FOIL: 2:30 PM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USFA membership is required. You MUST show your USFA card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USFA membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USFA or use your credit card for your USFA membership payment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.\r\n\r\nAll fencers MUST wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USFA requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords.

Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.\r\n \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\n\r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\nY10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 touches or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. \r\n\r\n(The rules for handling ties in score at the end of regulation, awarding of cards and non-combativity will apply as currently written.)\r\n\r\nMEDALS: \r\n\r\nIn the Y8 events, medals will be given to the Top 8 finishers.  In the Y10, Y12 and Y14 categories the top 3 finishers will receive medals.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply as set forth in the USA Fencing Rulebook and as discussed further in the USA Fencing Athlete Handbook (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/About-Us\/Manuals.aspx) \r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents to fencing.
