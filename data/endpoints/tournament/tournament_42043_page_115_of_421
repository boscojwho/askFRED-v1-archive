If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60191,"tournament_id":13933,"tournament":"Div. 3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-02-06T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13438,"name":"Schmitter EPEE: Open\/ Vet\/ Div 3","start_date":"2011-02-06","end_date":"","comments":"GLSC's Annual event to honor Maestro Charles Schmitter.

The events will alternate between foil and epee.\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments are designed for the beginning to 'D' level fencer. There are four tournaments per weapon. There will be a point system for Epee and Foil. Awards will be given to the top three fencers in the points standings at the last tournaments (Senior Circuit #7 & #8). The points system is described below.\r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm for these Thursday night events. Tournament cost is $10.00 if you preregister on AskFRED. $15.00 to register at the door.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door. \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1) Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of participants equals the number of points. So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points. The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2) Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating. USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age or older are the requirements. Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3) Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments. Awards will be given out at the last tournament of each weapon (Senior Circuit #7 & #8).

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes the Friday prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519  Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60401,"tournament_id":14007,"tournament":"D Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":22,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-02-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13242,"name":"Parkway Epee Open","start_date":"2011-02-13","end_date":"","comments":"$30 Entry Fee \r\n2nd event $15 \r\n\r\nPreregistration encouraged (fees doubled if not preregistered) \r\n\r\nUSFA membership and proper fencing uniform required.
