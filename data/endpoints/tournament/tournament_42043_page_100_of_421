Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.

That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

New and renewed memberships will carry through to the end of next season.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 events (foil and epee) must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 1999-2002\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1997-2000\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1995-1998\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=11900\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/19\/2010\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.

The fee at the door will be $10 registration fee PLUS $10 per event.\r\n\r\nThere will be an awards table for the top 8 finishers to choose their prize. First place picks first, 2nd place next etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, Youth Progressives are fun fencing events designed to help young athletes (and parents) to learn about and prepare for competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nUnrated Y10 Mixed Foil\r\nUnrated Y12 Mixed Epee\r\nUnrated Y12 Mixed Foil\r\nUnrated Y12 Mixed Saber\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed 15-year-olds may fence Epee\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed 15-year-olds may fence Foil\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed 15-year-olds may fence Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 5\/17\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 5\/25\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Boston Fencing Club","address":"110 Clematis Ave #2","city":"Waltham","state":"MA","zip":"02452","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":50579,"tournament_id":11821,"tournament":"Youth Progressive 3","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":20,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-26T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":50580,"tournament_id":11821,"tournament":"Youth Progressive 3","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-26T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":50581,"tournament_id":11821,"tournament":"Youth Progressive 3","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":15,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-26T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":50582,"tournament_id":11821,"tournament":"Youth Progressive 3","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-26T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":50583,"tournament_id":11821,"tournament":"Youth Progressive 3","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-26T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":50584,"tournament_id":11821,"tournament":"Youth Progressive 3","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-26T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":50585,"tournament_id":11821,"tournament":"Youth Progressive 3","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-26T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"}]},{"id":12600,"name":"Chicago Lakeshore Fencers Club Open","start_date":"2010-06-26","end_date":"","comments":"A single event is $25 with preregistration, $35 at the door.\r\n\r\nFor two events, the cost with preregistration is $35.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY14 NoviceMixed Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/24\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48658,"tournament_id":11299,"tournament":"Y12 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-06-27T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11877,"name":"BCAF Y-10 and Y-12 Mixed Foil","start_date":"2010-06-27","end_date":"","comments":"$35\/event for fencers paying the $15 pre-registration fee on AskFRED by 6\/24\/10.

Initially, we are scheduling a circuit of four tournaments starting in June and extending through July, August, and September.  Prizes will be awarded to top finishers for each tournament as well as to the top point-holder at the end of the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe Viper Cup tournaments are scheduled for Friday evenings starting at 6:30 PM and will end no later than 9:30. \r\n\r\nOur goal is to run fencing tournaments at an economical cost and a convenient time that will maximize the number of competitive bouts for all participants, both to develop fencing skills as well as to have fun.   Participation is limited to C-ranked fencers and below.\r\n\r\n\r\nEntry & Fee\r\nFencers can enter by registering at AskFred or by simply showing up the evening of the tournament.  In either case the entry fee is $10.\r\n\r\n\r\nDates and Times\r\nThe inaugural series of the Viper Cup tournaments will be held on 6\/4, 7\/2, 8\/6, and 9\/3.  The tournaments will start at 6:30 PM.  However, we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be closing check-in at any particular time, so if you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re running late, don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worry.  You\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll still be able to fence as long as you arrive before 8:15 PM.\r\n \r\n\r\nCompetition Format\r\nIn order to finish the competition in 3 hours, the Viper Cup tournaments will use a non-standard competition format.   There will be a single initial round-robin pool with 100% promotion followed by a single-elimination tableau.  \r\n\r\n-Round Robin Pool\r\nPool matches will start promptly at 6:30PM.  Any fencer arriving after 6:30 can still join the pool and begin fencing.  Pool matches will be fenced opportunistically instead of according to a pre-scheduled order.  Matches will be to 5 points and last three minutes.  The round robin pool will end either when all fencers have fenced everyone else in the competition or at 8:15 PM, whichever happens first.\r\n\r\n-Seeding\r\nSince not all fencers will necessarily have fenced the same number of bouts, we will use a nonstandard seeding method into the elimination tableau.  Seeding will be based on the number of victories followed by the touch differential.  Seeding ties will be resolved with preference to the fencer with more bouts fenced and then according to fewer touches received.\r\n\r\n-Single-Elimination Tableau   \r\nElimination matches will start at 8:30 PM, or 15 minutes after the end of the round-robin pool, whichever comes first.  Fencers will be ranked according to their results in the table and paired accordingly. All elimination matches will be 3 out 5 3-touch bouts, winning by 2 points to a maximum of 4.  Each three-touch bout in the match will have a time limit of 1 \u00c2\u00bd minutes, with a 30 second break in between.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPoints and Prizes\r\nThe top three places in each Viper Cup tournament will be awarded medals.  Viper Cup Circuit Points will be awarded to each finisher according to their place.  At the end of the circuit, the Viper Cup Circuit Champion will win a $50 gift certificate to Blue Gauntlet\/Absolute Fencing\/???.\r\n\r\n\r\nCircuit Point Schedule:\r\n\r\nPlace\tPoints\r\n1st - \t10\r\n2nd - \t8\r\n3rd - \t6\r\n5th to 8th - \t4\r\n9th to 12th - \t3\r\n13th to 16th -\t2\r\n17th and higher - 1\r\n\r\n\r\nCurrent Viper Cup point standings will be posted on AskFred.\r\n\r\nAddress and Directions\r\nCobra Fencing Club\r\n4th Floor\r\nLackawanna Warehouse\r\n629 Grove Street, 4th Floor\r\nJersey, City NJ\r\nTel 201 882 2879\r\n\r\nFrom Manhattan by train: PATH train from Manhattan to Hoboken.
