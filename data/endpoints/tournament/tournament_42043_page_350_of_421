He continued to compete in epee while studying in Brussels, finishing 10th in the Belgian Nationals in 1973. He was assistant coach at Lakeland HS in 1988-89. He also ran Fair Lawn's fencing program as head coach for 20 years, retiring in 2016. He has also served as the President of the HS Coaches Association (NJIFA) from 2012-2016. He volunteered his time as a member of the NJ Division's Executive Committee, and also the Tournament Committee. Fencers always saw him at competitions as a referee and\/or armorer all over New Jersey, NY, and New England. He was one of the pioneers of r promoting our sport in high schools throughout the area. In September 2018, Dr. Packer passed away sadly. We will continue to run this tournament in his memory every year to show our appreciation for his hardwork and dedication.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll fencers Must wear required fencing attire and bring at least 2 working weapons and 2 working body cords.\r\n\r\nValid USFA membership is required.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/7.

PLEASE REMEMBER TO RETURN THE KEY.\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe strongly discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-register and cannot show up, please remove your name from the pre-registration list as a courtesy to others who are fencing and organizers trying to run a quality event.\r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0975473,"longitude":-75.1451365,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":169541,"tournament_id":42632,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH  D2 Epee","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":13,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-08-17T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":43916,"name":"Fete de Lune","start_date":"2019-08-17","end_date":"","comments":"This year the Fete de Lune commemorates the 50th anniversary of the moon landing.

We will have 2 folks who will either be dedicated referees or fencers depending on how many signup.\r\n\r\n6.) The tournament is round robin and has a hard stop at 4:30pm(ish).  If we have less teams and we can pull it off before then, great.  But we'll be tired by that point.\r\n\r\n7.) We will ref out of teams if none of our refs are available.  No cheating.

Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED.  $25 at the door.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $15 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2019-2020 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership.

No jeans or sweatpants allowed. A foil mask with conductive bib and mask cord are required. Foil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.  Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2006 or earlier\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":175073,"tournament_id":44259,"tournament":"MTFC Senior Mixed Foil - Welcome to the New Season","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":22,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-08-25T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":44022,"name":"Escrime For Ice Cream EPEE OPEN at Medeo","start_date":"2019-08-25","end_date":"","comments":"You provide the fencing, we provide the ice cream...

So we are instead using this event to help fundraise to help defer medical bills. So all proceeds and any other donations that result from this event will go to support Sawyer and his family.\r\n\r\nBelow is a small write up Sawyer's mother, Stephanie has put together. We appreciate any and all support for a fellow fencer.\r\n\r\nSawyer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Story:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nSawyer Cornett started fencing at the age of nine. He trained at the Bluegrass Fencers' Club in Lexington, Kentucky. Sawyer trained with two time Olympian Lee Kiefer four days a week under the watchful eye of former Olympic foil coach Amgad Khazbak.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, Sawyer was the regional youth circuit bronze winner in youth 14 men's foil for region 2.\r\n\r\nIn 2017, Sawyer was named to the USA All-American team.\r\n\r\nSawyer committed to the Cleveland State University fencing team his senior year of high school and started competing for CSU in the fall of 2018. The men's foil team had an impressive 2018-2019 season. At the Case Western Duals, Sawyer led the mens team with a 18-0 finish for the event. The men's foil team also pulled out the upset over North Carolina the following weekend. The highlight of Sawyer's freshman season was a second place finish for the men's foil team at the Midwest Championship. Sawyer's favorite part of being on the Viking's fencing team was the lasting friendships he made with his teammates.\r\n\r\nThis summer while Sawyer was home for the summer he was diagnosed with T-cell ALL acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Although Sawyer was looking forward to getting back to Cleveland for his sophmore year at CSU, he will have to take the year off for chemo treatments.\r\n\r\nT-cell ALL comprises 10-25% of all acute lymphoblastic leukemia cases. Sawyer's treament consists of weekly lumbar punctures with chemo delivered directly through his spine, weekly chemo infusions and daily oral medications. Sawyer developed a blood clot from one of his central lines and now takes a blood thinner shot twice a day. Sawyer also developed diabetes from the high doses of steroids that are part of his chemo regiment and has to take insulin several times a day until the steroid doses are changed.\r\n\r\nWith all the changes in Sawyer's life in just a short time, he has a positive attitude and an amazing sense of humor. Sawyer was a tough competitior on and off the strip. The hard work ethic that comes from years of competitive fencing help Sawyer have the stamina to recieve treatments week after week. His athletic body responded very fast to the chemo and we saw immediate results. His good eating habits have continued and help keep his energy up. Fencing has been a very big part of Sawyer's life for the past 10 years. We believe fencing has prepared Sawyer for the fight of his life.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note the venue is air conditioned.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: Equipment check will include masks, gloves ,body cords and head cords.\r\n\r\nIf there are 25 or more fencers than awards will go to 8th place.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Please email info@tacomafencing.com if you would like to be added to the waiting list.  There is still room in the Epee event. \r\n\r\nPlease join us for an unsanctioned Sharks and Minnows Event. All fencers from all clubs welcome. Foil at 10.30 AM and Epee at 1 PM.  Fencers are welcome to sign up for both.\r\n\r\nA current 2019-2020 membership to the US Fencing Association (non-competitive membership is fine) is required for this event due to insurance and liability requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info ------------------- \r\n\r\nWe are right next to Olympus Women's Health Club and across the street from H-Mart. Our address is 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 10:30 AM for foil and 1 PM for Epee. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $15 if pre-registered on AskFred, $20 at the door. If you pre-register for both, cost is $25.  You are already reading the information so just go up and click the \"Preregister\" button right now....\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. You cannot earn any national points. But maybe if you are good or lucky you can go next door to the boba shop. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen 'cause it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nWe have equipment available to rent for $15 (MTFC Members no charge).  If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nThis is a mixed gender, mixed age event. To spice things up and get more fencing in for everyone we will probably do a sharks-and-minnows format. In this format there is the usual first round of pools with seeded fencers separated. So each pool will have pretty experienced fencers mixed in with beginners. Those who do the best in the first round (the sharks) will be put together for the second round of pools. And everyone else (the minnows) will also have a second round among themselves. That way the sharks can beat each other up. And the minnows can have a more even chance to be the biggest guppy. At least the top two sharks will have a final bout as an exhibition and as motivation for our beginners. Maybe the top minnows can have a finals, too. As you can see, the tournament organizers can make things up as they go to try to get our kids the most fencing and best practice.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL NOTES\r\nWe have room for 30 total fencers in each event. You snooze, you lose. So just click the \"Preregister\" button right now. However, if we are full and some poor fencer cannot register because you signed up but knew you were not going to make it, we may \"accidentally\" erase your future registrations because of the whole karma thing (like for all of eternity). So please be kind to your fellow fencers and unregsiter (via the AskFRED e-mail) if you cannot make it. (And yes, we will take pity on you if you come down with some highly contagious disease the night before the event so do not make it even if you are registered.)\r\n\r\nSEEDING\r\nWe will probably seed by classification then highest national rank then randomly in case you were wondering. Sort of weird because we will take your national rank (if you have one) regardless of age and gender group and combine it. But this is sort of what is done with the 50-59 year old group when the 49 year olds age out....\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":175540,"tournament_id":44356,"tournament":"MTFC Sharks and Minnows Foil and Epee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":30,"prereg_count":30,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-09-07T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":175541,"tournament_id":44356,"tournament":"MTFC Sharks and Minnows Foil and Epee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-09-07T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":44614,"name":"AFM Div1A ROC","start_date":"2019-09-07","end_date":"2019-09-08","comments":"Come and join us for the first regional Division 1A ROC at AFM Sunnyvale!","prereg_open":"2019-08-19","prereg_close":"2019-09-06","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Come join us for AFM Division 1A ROC!\r\n\r\nThis listing is for information only, Please register on the USA Fencing website: \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/details\/tournaments\/3876\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents:\r\nDiv1A Men's Epee\r\nDiv1A Women's Epee\r\nDiv1A Men's Saber\r\nDiv1A Women's Saber\r\nDiv1A Men's Foil\r\nDiv1A Women's Foil\r\n\r\nVENUE:\r\nAFM Sunnyvale\r\n1269 Forgewood Ave.,\r\nSunnyvale, CA 94089\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"AFM Sunnyvale","address":"1269 Forgewood Ave.","city":"Sunnyvale","state":"CA","zip":"94089","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.4082313,"longitude":-121.9925857,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"}},{"id":44616,"name":"AFM Division 1A ROC","start_date":"2019-09-07","end_date":"2019-09-08","comments":"Come join us for the AFM Division 1A ROC!","prereg_open":"","prereg_close":"","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":true,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Come join us for AFM Division 1A ROC!\r\n\r\nThis listing is for information only, please register on the USA Fencing website: \r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/details\/tournaments\/3876\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents:\r\nDiv1A Men's Epee\r\nDiv1A Women's Epee\r\nDiv1A Men's Saber\r\nDiv1A Women's Saber\r\nDiv1A Men's Foil\r\nDiv1A Women's Foil\r\n\r\nVENUE:\r\nAFM Sunnyvale\r\n1269 Forgewood Ave.,\r\nSunnyvale, CA 94089\r\n","venue":{"name":"Academy of Fencing Masters - Sunnyvale","address":"1269 Forgewood Ave","city":"Sunnyvale","state":"CA","zip":"94089","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.4082313,"longitude":-121.9925857,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":176469,"tournament_id":44616,"tournament":"AFM Division 1A ROC","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":44621,"name":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #1","start_date":"2019-09-07","end_date":"","comments":"Developmental Practice Tournament with Novice and Intermediate Categories, for Youth (8-12) and Senior (13+)","prereg_open":"2019-08-19","prereg_close":"2019-09-06","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center is pleased to announce a series of special Developmental Practice Tournaments.

These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nIT'S NATIONAL BEARD DAY! Get ready to win by a whisker! All prizes will be related to our theme, so be prepared for a hairy-scary time.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n5:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it's ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior: can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries x place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact Jade Calvert at j.calvert@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"7601 Boulevard 26","city":"N.
