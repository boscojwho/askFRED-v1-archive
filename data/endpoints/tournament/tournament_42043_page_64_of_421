Accordingly, fencers who do not meet the age restriction but who have points in the next lower age group will be allowed to fence; these fencers should e-mail us at info@brooklynfencing.com to be added to the pre-registered list. (ie, fencers with y14 points may fence cadets; fencers with cadet points may fence juniors).\r\n\r\nFencers planning to fence both age groups are advised there will be some overlap between events (you may have to fence some cadet DE bouts during your junior pool if you're doing well in the cadets).  Directors are used to this and will not scratch your bouts if you're fencing in the other event; however, fencing in two events is your choice - please be ready to fence a few bouts in a row if need be to keep your events moving.\r\n\r\nAs always, all fencers must bring their USFA card or be prepared to join at the door ($60, bring a credit card # or separate check).\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Center","address":"62 4th

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nVet 40 Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/28\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30763,"tournament_id":6875,"tournament":"\"Vet\" Epee","full_name":"Vet40 Mixed Epee","short_name":"V40MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Vet40","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-02-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7147,"name":"GLSC - Y14, Y12, Y10 Foil Tournament","start_date":"2009-02-01","end_date":"","comments":"VENUE CHANGE!

Bouts will be fenced to five points or three minutes, just as seeding bouts are fenced in a regular meet. The tournament is capped at 24 fencers.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $25.00. Registration will be accepted at the door until the 24 fencer limit is reached, but a late fee of $5.00 will be assessed at the door. \r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: Epee Melee 09\r\nDate: 02\/07\/2009\r\nLocation: Southside Baptist Church\r\nBaton Rouge, LA 70708\r\n\r\nContact: Ben Price -- 225.938.2039\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nSenior Mixed Epee  | Sat 2\/07 | 9:00 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Southside Baptist Church","address":"1700 Lee Dr.","city":"Baton Rouge","state":"LA","zip":"70808","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":30.410694,"longitude":-91.146791,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":65,"name":"Louisiana","abbrev":"LA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":33777,"tournament_id":7590,"tournament":"Epee Melee 09","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-02-07T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7592,"name":"2008-09 VA Division Team Championships","start_date":"2009-02-07","end_date":"2009-02-08","comments":"This is the qualifiers for Team events at Sum Nats as well as Div Team Champs.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/04\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30766,"tournament_id":6878,"tournament":"Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":26,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-02-08T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":7391,"name":"MFC Saber Liberty Cup","start_date":"2009-02-08","end_date":"","comments":"$35 if paid through askfred, $50 at the door.

With the initial four tournaments in the first series completed, it's time for the second series (Circuits #5-8) to begin! \r\n\r\nRegistration closes at 7:00pm-ish for these Thursday night events.  Tournament cost is 10.00. \r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for all fencers and can be purchased or renewed at the door.*\r\n\r\nThe Senior Circuit tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Senior Circuit #4 and will be based on points earned in Senior Circuits #1-4.  This first series will be entirely foil.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Senior Circuit #8 and will be based on Senior Circuits #5-8. The second series will be exclusively epee.  Trophies will be awarded to the top 3 points earners in each series, respectively.\r\n\r\nHere's how it works:\r\n\r\n1)  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of participants equals the number of points.  So, 20 fencers equals...you guessed it, 20 points.  The winner would receive all 20 points, while the 20th fencer would earn 1 point.\r\n\r\n2)  Events are open to all fencers who have a D or lower rating.  USFA membership, full fencing gear (we can provide equipment but that's based on a first come\/serve basis), and being 13 years of age by January 1st of the 2008-09 season or higher are the requirements.  Events will be gender mixed.\r\n\r\n3)  Overall points standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Senior Circuit tournaments.  Trophies will be given out at the last tournament of each series.  If fencers, for whatever reason, cannot attend, prizes will be held for them at the center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nD & Under Mixed Epee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on
