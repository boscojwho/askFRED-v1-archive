If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase. Pizza will be brought in for lunch at $2\/slice.\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: https:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/  (see bottom of page) \r\n","venue":{"name":"Bucks County Academy of Fencing","address":"287 S.

Showing up after 10AM of the competition you will be scratched with no refund.  All events can be entered either by pre-registering or by registering onsite up until the time specified for the event.  Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change). NO REFUNDS\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds and women\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.

If there are at least 5 girls and 5 boys, we will separate the event by gender. Medals will be given to the top 4 boys and top 4 girls in each event.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful.  \r\n\r\nFencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver (attached) to participate. All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome! Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\nFor additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\nBrenda Waddoups\r\nFencing Institute of Texas, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=42823\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/22\/2019\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

The exemption to this rule applies to any fencer who is younger than 13 on January 1 but who is listed on the latest National Junior Point standings; then that fencer is allowed to compete in the USA Fencing competitions not specific to an age group. The athlete must meet any other criteria stated for that competition. Examples of such non-specific competitions are: \"Open\", \"Unclassified\", \"A\" competitions, \"C\" or under competitions, Team competitions of any category unless specified for juniors or similar age restricted category.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nUnrated Senior Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Epee\r\nUnrated Senior Mixed Saber\r\nSenior Mixed Saber\r\n","venue":{"name":"The Fencing Center","address":"1290 S. 1st Street","city":"San Jose","state":"CA","zip":"95110","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.3179845,"longitude":-121.8748506,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":3,"name":"Central California","abbrev":"CTRCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":168703,"tournament_id":42421,"tournament":"TFC May 2019 Epee\/Saber-A-Thon","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-12T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":168704,"tournament_id":42421,"tournament":"TFC May 2019 Epee\/Saber-A-Thon","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":28,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-12T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":168705,"tournament_id":42421,"tournament":"TFC May 2019 Epee\/Saber-A-Thon","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-12T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":168706,"tournament_id":42421,"tournament":"TFC May 2019 Epee\/Saber-A-Thon","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-05-12T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":41172,"name":"D'Artagnan's Challenge Series 5A (Y8\/12 Epee)","start_date":"2019-05-12","end_date":"","comments":"Check-in at office at 1:45 PM.
