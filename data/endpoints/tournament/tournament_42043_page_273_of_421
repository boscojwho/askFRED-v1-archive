If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 6\/8\/16. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 6\/8\/16) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip.

Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Since this is standard foil, the point must stay on the target for .5 or more seconds and bend the blade 3-4 inches.  Judges and Directors will be instructed to ignore \u0091Insufficient Thrusts\u0092 or \u0091Incidental contact\u0092.\r\nJudging is by the standard foil rules.  Se AFLA rules from 1965 for guidance.  When a point is scored, judges with raise their hands which will signal the director to call \u0093halt!\u0094. Judges have one vote and the director has 1.5 votes.  The director will make the call and then poll the judges.  The judges are allowed to say, yes, no, yes of target or abstain.  They are not allowed to make any other comment unless asked for it by the director.  If it is determined a point has been scored the director will alert the score keeper or call out the updated score tally themselves\r\nScoring:\r\n\u0095\tThrusts \r\no\tCovered and controlled thrust to target area 1pt.\r\nOther scoring actions:\r\n\u0095\tRun off the end of the strip \u0096 1 pt.\r\n\u0095\tOpponent is disarmed by an intentional action of your blade\u0097 1pt.\r\n\u0095\tNote, in the rare occasion that a fencer is disarmed while being run off the strip or hit in a valid target area while being run off the strip, then their opponent will receive 2 points.  If the fencer is hit off target while being run off the strip, the attacker is only awarded 1 point. \r\nDouble hits: The score goes to the attacker if the defender is one tempo behind with their defense or counter offence.

We want to encourage people to use the growing number of weapons that are available now so we do not have strict limitations on the weapons allowed.  Italian weapons with crossbars are encouraged and the cross bar can extend beyond the bell.  Wrist straps and martingales are encouraged and allowed.  Traditional Italian blades were often a bit longer than what we find in modern fencing and they are allowed if you have one.  French blades were often a bit shorter than what is allowed today and fencers with such weapons are encouraged to use them.  There is a wide variety of bell types allowed but fencers who use weapons with smaller classical French style guards must also use thicker gloves to protect their hands.\r\nTournament organizers are allowed to prohibit the use of any item of equipment they deem unsafe or in ill repair.  Equipment must be free from rust and all sharp burs on the blade removed with a file.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b><i>Rules for Classical Fencing Sabre Tournament<\/i><\/b>\r\n \r\nGeneral rules:\r\nWe will follow the USFA rules for sabre with the following modifications.  Note this event is standard foil and only classical sabre grips are allowed.\r\nTime: Bouts will go to 3 min or 5 points unless scores are tied and then a sudden death overtime round will be used to determine the winner.\r\nTouches: A strike with the sword must be a controlled and properly delivered to the defined sabre target area. Typically, this is any hit above the waist but tournament organizers may also allow the top of the front leg as a target if they wish.  Since this is standard sabre, the weapon can score only with the forward cutting edge, the tip and the back 1\/3 of the blade as a counter cut.  Any point thrust must stay on the target for .5 or more seconds and bend the blade 3-4 inches.  Cuts must hit with sufficient force to have cussed a wound if the weapons were real and the blade must be pushed or drawn across the target for the cut to score.  Judges and Directors will be instructed to ignore; insufficient thrusts or cuts, hits with the flat or non-cutting area of the blade, or incidental contact such as hit with the bell guard of the weapon.\r\nJudging is by the standard sabre rules.  See the AFLA rules from 1965 for guidance.  When a point is scored, judges with raise their hands which will signal the director to call \u0093halt!\u0094 Judges have one vote and the director has 1.5 votes.  The director will make the call and then poll the judges.  The judges are allowed to say, yes, no, yes of target or abstain.  They are not allowed to make any other comment unless asked for it by the director.  If it is determined a point has been scored the director will alert the score keeper or call out the updated score tally themselves\r\nScoring:\r\n\u0095\tThrusts \r\no\tCovered and controlled thrust to target area 1pt.\r\no\tCovered and controlled cut to target area 1pt.\r\nOther scoring actions:\r\n\u0095\tRun off the end of the strip \u0096 1 pt.\r\n\u0095\tOpponent is disarmed by an intentional action of your blade\u0097 1pt.\r\n\u0095\tNote, in the rare occasion that a fencer is disarmed while being run off the strip or hit in a valid target area while being run off the strip, then their opponent will receive 2 points.  If the fencer is hit off target while being run off the strip, the attacker is only awarded 1 point. \r\nDouble hits: The score goes to the attacker if the defender is one tempo behind with their defense or counter offence.  The score goes to the defender if the attacker continues with a poorly executed renewed attack disregarding the priority of the defense.  The score goes to the counter attacker if the attacker continues with a poorly executed attack or second intention attack disregarding the priority of the counter attacker. \r\nProhibited actions:\r\n\u0095\tPunches and kicks are not permitted.\r\n\u0095\tThrows or wresting.\r\n\u0095\tHits with the guard of the weapon.\r\n\u0095\tHand parries will count as a point to the defending fencer, as if they had been struck in valid target areas.\r\n\u0095\tTarget Covering \u0096 deliberately covering a target to stop an attack with non-target areas such as hand, leg or head, will result in full points being awarded to the attacking fencer, and a warning from the officiating staff.\r\nFencer conduct:\r\n\u0095\tIn all of the following, offenders will be first verbally warned, second 1 point removed from the fencers total, third removed from the tournament.\r\no\tAll fencers will be expected to fight with both skill and control.\r\no\tAny fencer that is deemed to pose a danger to themselves or others \r\no\tFencers are expected to act professionally, and respectful to the officiating staff.\r\no\tFencers are expected to follow the commands of the tournament staff at all times.\r\nRequired Protective Gear:\r\nFencers must wear appropriate fencing gear including helmet, jacket, gloves, pants\/knickers, heavy socks, and athletic shoes.
