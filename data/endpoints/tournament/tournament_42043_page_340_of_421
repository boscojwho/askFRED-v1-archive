Occasionally, tournament organizers will add a second aspect \u00e2\u0080\u0094 e.g., a clinic the day before, a Senior Open MS or allowing women to also participate in the MS event (i.e., make the MS event a Mixed Saber). \r\n  \r\nCompetitors regularly attend from the East Coast and visitors from farther away are always welcome (and can occasionally find a Vet fencer to host those who need a place to stay).   \r\n\r\nIn addition to awards for each individual tournament, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2018-2019 Cup Point Standings at the end of the season will receive awards.   \r\n\r\n2018-2019 Season Cup Points for each fencer will be calculated as follows:  \r\n\r\n1. The sum of that fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 4 best results across all 2018-2019 Cup events (if they compete in 4 or fewer events, all of the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s results will count).  \r\n\r\n2. Points awarded to fencers at each event will depend on their finish and the number and letter rating of other participants in the event as follows: \r\na. Each participating fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (U=2, E=3, D=4, C=5, B=6, A=7)  \r\nb. Each fencer will earns the number of points equal to the total value of all the fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points. \r\nc. In the case of Vet Mixed Events, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) that finish below them. \r\n","venue":{"name":"Sheridan Fencing Academy","address":"1801 1st Ave","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10128","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7816229,"longitude":-73.946223,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":170065,"tournament_id":42780,"tournament":"2019 Veteran Sabre Slam & Training Day!","full_name":"VetCombined Women's Saber","short_name":"VCmWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-10T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"},{"id":170066,"tournament_id":42780,"tournament":"2019 Veteran Sabre Slam & Training Day!","full_name":"VetCombined Men's Saber","short_name":"VCmMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":25,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-10T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":42535,"name":"Rocky River High School Invitational 2019","start_date":"2019-03-09","end_date":"","comments":"Open to ALL fencers grades 9-12 or homeschool equivalent with HS or competitive USFA membership. \r\n\r\nAward to HS with best results as per OH HS Point system.

Only the best 2 results count towards the point total. These points may qualify Cadet and Junior fencers to the USA Fencing Junior Olympics and July Challenge. Points earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of national point standings; they are only reflected in regional point standings. \r\n\r\nUsing the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants:\r\n\r\n((# entries - place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points\r\n\r\nThe winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of region. Regional RJCC Points are only earned in the fencer's own region.\r\n\r\nRJCCs must have at least 2 competitors and cannot be fenced with mixed gender.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to 2020 Junior Olympics from the Junior RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 110 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to JO's from the Cadet RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 110 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li>\r\n<li>Earn 110 Cadet Regional Points composed by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Notes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Points earned from January 11, 2019 - January 10, 2020 will count toward qualification<\/li>\r\n<li>Regional Points are composed of a fencer's top 2 point finishes within the fencer's region<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to the July Challenge from the Junior RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 65 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Qualification Path to the July Challenge from the Cadet RJCCs<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Earn 65 Junior Regional Points by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li>\r\n<li>Earn 65 Cadet Regional Points composed by the regular entry fee deadline<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Notes<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Points earned from August 2018 - May 2019 will count toward qualification (as long as the fencer is still age eligible)<\/li>\r\n<li>Regional Points are composed of a fencer's top 2 point finishes within the fencer's region<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>For more information about the RJCC:<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjcc-resources<\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Registration & Fees<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Registration is through USFencing.<\/li>\r\n\r\n<li>The Open Period Price ends at 11:59pm on 2\/16\/19.<\/li> \r\n<ul><b>Open Period Admin Fee: $5\r\nOpen Period Registration Fee: $14\r\nOpen Period Sanction Fee: $6\r\nOpen Period Event Fee: $30<\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<li>The Late Period Price begins on 2\/17\/19 and ends at 11:59pm on 3\/5\/19. <\/li>\r\n<ul><b>Late Period Admin Fee: $15\r\nLate Period Registration Fee: $42\r\nLate Period Sanction Fee: $6\r\nLate Period Event Fee: $90<\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<li>Registrations will not be accepted after 11:59pm on 3\/5\/19. <b>NO EXCEPTIONS.<\/b> All registrations must be completed on the USFencing platform.<\/li><\/ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Seeding<\/b>\r\n\r\n<ul>The Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase. Pizza will be brought in for lunch at $2\/slice.\r\n \r\nOther helpful info:\r\n \r\n* 309 traffic can be busy so leave enough travel time. \r\n \r\n* Phone number is (215) 716-3777.

Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usfencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We expect to have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2010-2013\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2008-2011\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2004-2007\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=41425\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/15\/2019\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
