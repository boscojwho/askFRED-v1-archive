If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

Your points will show up for that weapon and age group.\r\n\r\n---------- EQUIPMENT: ----------\r\n\r\nAll entrants must wear proper protective equipment (fencing jacket, plastron, breeches, mask and glove) during competition.

Weapons will be checked for weight resistance, shims, and screws, etc. \r\nPlease bring more than one weapon and body cord per fencer in case you have a problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease bring proof of USFA Membership including your USFA membership number because we will not have internet access to verify from the USFA website. You can now purchase 1-day membership from USFA for a small fee, but they do not allow you to purchase 1-day membership on the actual day of the tournament. If you do purchase 1-day membership, bring a printed receipt with the date of the tournament.

To become a member or renew your membership, please visit: https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/MembershipRegistration.aspx. If you do not have a current membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. Your USA Fencing membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you. Temporary paper membership cards can be printed off using the link above. \r\nWAIVER must be filled out and brought when checking in.\r\n\r\nThose who have not had their birth year verified by USA Fencing will also have to show a birth certificate, passport or other government issued ID at registration. Copies of these documents are acceptable. \r\n\r\nBirth Year\/Points eligibility\r\nY14  1999-2002 or on Y12NRP list.\r\nY12  2001-2004 or on Y10 NRP list.\r\nY10  2003-2006.\r\nIf your registration is rejected for age and you are on the NRP list for the next lower age group, please email the organizer to process your entry at current fee rates.\r\n\r\nSEEDING\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee will use the current rating and points information found on the USA Fencing website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating and points standing are correct with USA Fencing and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing Current points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n1.\tCurrent national Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC\r\n2.\tLetter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3.\tAthletes with neither of the above are seeded in a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event (i.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc). As this information comes directly from AskFred, fencers should make sure their AskFred profile is up-to-date.\r\n\r\nFORMAT\r\nAll events will have one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. \r\n\r\nY10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 hits or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. \r\n\r\nY12 and Y14DE bouts are for 15 hits or end when 3 periods of 3 minutes, with a one minute rest between each period, has elapsed. \r\n\r\nIn events with fewer than 11 entrants, Bout Committee may elect to have 2 rounds of pools followed by 100% promoted to DEs. There is no fence-off for third place.\r\n\r\nUNIFORM REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Conductive foil bibs are required. Elastic strap at the back of the mask is required. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform.\r\n\r\nThe Armoury Equipment Check will test the mask, lame, sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specifically marked. Directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing. Full Armory Equipment Check is required for all competitors, with no exceptions. Fencers only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the SYC.\r\n\r\nFor Y10 events, a 30\u0094 or 32\u0094 blade is required. For Y12 and Y14, standard blade length of 30-35\u0094 is permitted. These rules will be strictly enforced.\r\n\r\nVENDOR: Absolute Fencing Gear will be on site for the tournament.\r\n\r\nVENUE AND HOST HOTEL INFORMATION:\r\n\r\nCrowne Plaza Denver International Airport Convention Center \r\n15500 East 40th Avenue\r\nDenver, CO  80239\r\n\r\nKing rooms available\r\n\r\n$89\/night including hot breakfast 6:00 - 11:00 am + 12.75% tax\r\n\r\nRates are in effect until 10\/25\/13 and depend upon availability.
