If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall (267) 482-9597 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":156838,"tournament_id":39374,"tournament":"Liberty Y14 and Div2 Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-03-04T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":156839,"tournament_id":39374,"tournament":"Liberty Y14 and Div2 Epee","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-03-04T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":38372,"name":"Western Washington Foil & Epee Challenge Series #5","start_date":"2018-03-04","end_date":"","comments":"Salle Auriol Seattle, Rain City Fencing Center, and Washington Fencing Academy are pleased to announce the Western Washington Foil & Epee Challenge.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 3\/7\/18.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA.

Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted.

This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes).

Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Points earned at Regional Junior\/Cadet tournaments are not considered in determination of national point standings; they are only reflected in regional point standings. \r\n\r\nUsing the formula below, RJCC tournaments will award points to all participants:\r\n\r\n((# entries \u00ef\u00bf\u00bd place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points\r\n\r\nThe winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of region.

Membership\r\nexceptions for foreign fencers do apply. Athletes without proof of membership must complete\r\ncompetitive membership registration prior to competing.\r\nParents\/guardians should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds age\r\nneeds verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to\r\ninformation@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nTo avoid bringing this documentation, USA Fencing has an age verification process.\r\nCurrent Verification Process:\r\nAn athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via\r\nemail (information@usfencing.org), mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the\r\ndatabase. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and\r\ntemporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nSEEDING:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\nSeeding should be based on the following order:\r\n&#61623; National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n&#61623; Classification and year\r\n&#61623; If athlete has neither National Points nor a weapon classification they are seeded on a random\r\nbasis with the other athletes in the same situation\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nSeeding should be based on the following order:\r\n&#61623; Current National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n&#61623; Classification and year\r\n&#61623; Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who\r\nare seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nPOINTS:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\n\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will\r\nearn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn\r\nregional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn\r\nqualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For more information on this Regional Points formula\r\nsee the Regional Recognition Initiative Document available http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources\r\nUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Regional Rank\r\neach season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior\r\ntournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional\r\npoints do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an\r\nolder age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as\r\nwell. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet,\r\nhe\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events.\r\nJunior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are also only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and\r\nJunior Olympic\/National Championships. \r\n\r\nRYC:\r\n\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds membership division is in the region in which the RYC is\r\nheld will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their\r\nregion will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A\r\npercentage of athletes (Y12\/Y14) will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For\r\nmore information on this Regional Points formula see the Regional Recognition Initiative\r\nDocument available on http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources.\r\nUp to the best 3 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Regional\r\nRank each season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional\r\nYouth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12\r\nregional points do NOT trickle down to Y10).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer\r\nqualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn\r\nqualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the National\r\nChampionships in Y14 and is age eligible for Y12, he\/she will also qualify in Y12)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RYC events.\r\n(Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC\r\nto a maximum of 64 fencers and, depending on the size of the competitive field, to the top 32\r\nor 64 fencers (depending on field size) at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS:\r\n\r\nRJCC:\r\n\r\nThe RJCC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Cadet and Junior fencers to the Junior Olympic\r\nNational Championships and the USA Fencing Summer Nationals July Challenge.\r\nA percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National\r\nChampionships and for the Junior Olympic Championships in Junior and Cadet.\r\nFor more information on Cadet and Junior qualification paths refer to the Athlete\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Handbook:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook and the qualification table available under the \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdQualification\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd\r\ntab on the RJCC resources page at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjccresources.\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\n\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth\r\nNAC and for Y10\/12 and 14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\nA percentage of regional point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer\r\nNational Championships in Y12 and Y14.
