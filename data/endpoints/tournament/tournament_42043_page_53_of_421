The YMCA is just off Interstate 71. \r\n\r\nCurse of the White Paw is open to all USFA members who are rated \"D,\" \"E,\" or unclassified in the weapon or weapons they wish to fence. If you are a current member, please bring your USFA card to the registration table when you check in. If you purchased your membership online and have not yet received your card, please bring your member number to the registration table. If you are not a USFA member, will we have applications at the registration table. If you have <i>never<\/i> been a USFA member, a membership purchased at this tournament will be valid for the 2008-2009 membership year, as well as the remainder of 2007-2008. \r\n\r\nRegistration for mixed foil will close at 9:30 a.m. Registration for mixed epee will close at 12:30 p.m. Registration for mixed saber will close at 2:30 p.m. In every case, fencing will begin shortly after registration closes. \r\n\r\nRegistration fees are $20 to fence one weapon, and $10 for each additional weapon; that is, $30 for two weapons or $40 for three weapons. \r\n\r\nPreregistration via askFRED closes 07\/25\/2008.

However, please DO NOT preregister if you know you aren't going to attend, and don't preregister other fencers if they aren't going to attend.
