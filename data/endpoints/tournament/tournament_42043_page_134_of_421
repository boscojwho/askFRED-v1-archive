IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $6.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc@gmail.com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.2676114,"longitude":-123.250492,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":70083,"tournament_id":16530,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2011","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-10-23T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":70084,"tournament_id":16530,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2011","full_name":"Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":23,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-10-23T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":70086,"tournament_id":16530,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2011","full_name":"Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-10-23T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":70117,"tournament_id":16530,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2011","full_name":"Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-10-23T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16289,"name":"Maryland FC October Practice Tournament","start_date":"2011-10-23","end_date":"","comments":"Practice tournament for MDFC only. $10 entry if you pre-register here, $20 entry if you are not pre-registered by 10\/21.

Any requests for refunds due to outstanding and unusual circumstances are at the discretion of the organizers and will be processed after the tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nTournament Organization\r\nAll events will be fenced electrically.\r\nMasks, body cords AND LAMES! will be subject to equipment control. Sabre cuffs are required. Seeding will be according to standard guidelines for ROC events. It is the responsibility of the fencer to notify the Bout Committee at the time of registration if they are on the NRPS. One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches. Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash. Organizers reserve the right to limit fencing in cross-over events in order to efficiently run the tournament.\r\n\r\nUSFA Membership\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. \r\n\r\nONE DAY USFA MEMBERSHIPS ARE \"NOT\" VALID FOR ENTRY INTO ROC EVENTS. \r\n\r\nProof of membership is required. Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiver of Liability\r\nThe Louisiana Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\nPre-registration closes the Friday prior to the event. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70490,"tournament_id":16652,"tournament":"Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-10-30T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16408,"name":"Elementary,Middle,High school Team Tournament","start_date":"2011-10-30","end_date":"2011-10-29","comments":"This is a Team Tournament open to all Elementary,Middle & High schools, and home school, 2nd grade, (8 years and older, All equipment is provided.

Your pledge will apply to every touch scored by Mariel or her opponent in both bouts. In other words, if there are two 15-touch bouts that total 50 touches scored, and if you pledge $0.25 per touch, you would contribute $12.50 to the foundation. \r\n\r\nTo pledge: Simply send info@washingtonfencing.com an email with the amount you're pledging.
