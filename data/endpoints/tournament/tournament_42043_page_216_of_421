may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron or chest protector, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but no baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Waivers:<\/b>\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be

There will be foil events for all age groups, plus Y14 Epee.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth Season Finale\r\nDate(s): 06\/07\/2014\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday June 7th, 2014\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y14 Epee, Y14 Novice Foil\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $10 (plus tax) per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2013-2014 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 Novice event is for fencers who have never fenced a tournament before, or have only fenced our first Novice event in April. Fencers will need to upgrade their USA Fencing membership to the Competitive version. The renewal will last through the end of next season (July 2015).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: Y8 and Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touches, 2 periods of 3 minutes each. The first period ends when 3 minutes have elapsed or one fencer scores 5 touches, whichever comes first. Y12 direct elimination bouts are now 15 touches, 3 periods of 3 minutes each -- just like Y14 and senior DE bouts.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2005-2008\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2003-2006\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1999-2002\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=24605\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/01\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 6\/4\/14. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 6\/4\/14) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Prove you are the best of the best, and see how many more references to martial arts classics we can ruin.\r\n\r\nThe Championship Event is restricted to foil fencers with a D rating or higher.
