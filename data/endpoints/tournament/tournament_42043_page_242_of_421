This series will help students gain valuable tournament experience and prepare them for bigger events.\r\n\r\nNO RATINGS CAN BE AWARDED AT UNSANCTIONED EVENTS. No ratings will be earned at this event. AskFRED may automatically calculate the potential rating of each event based on preregistration. Disregard this information. No ratings can be earned or awarded for competition at unsanctioned, non-USFA events.\r\n\r\nFencers at this unsanctioned series (3 Tournaments) will earn points based on their results at each event. At the third and final tournament, awards will be given to fencers with the most points. This series emphasizes sportsmanship and friendly competition for newer fencers!\r\n\r\nThe top 4 places will be awarded with medals.\r\n\r\nThis non-USFA tournament will be governed by USFA rules. All fencers must wear thick socks to the knee, knickers (fencing pants), a plastron, chest protection (women), a jacket, a lame (foil\/sabre), a mask (electric for sabre\/foil) and a glove (electric glove or cuff for sabre). Bring a minimum of 2 electric weapons and 2 body cords.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION - $35 for the first event, $15 for additional events.\r\n\r\nAge Categories:\r\n\u0095 Youth 8: Born in 2007-2009\r\n\u0095 Youth 10: Born in 2004-2007\r\n\u0095 Youth 12: Born in 2002-2005\r\n\u0095 Youth 14: Born in 2000-2003\r\n\u0095 Senior: Born in 2001 or earlier\r\n\r\nY8 Mixed Sabre - 1:30pm - Saturday, 5\/16\r\nY8 Mixed Foil - 10am - Sunday, 5\/17\r\nY8 Mixed Epee - 9am - Sunday, 5\/17\r\n\r\nY10 Mixed Saber - 3pm - Saturday, 5\/16\r\nY10 Mixed Foil - 1:30 pm - Sunday, 5\/17\r\nY10\/Y12 Mixed Epee - 10:30am - Sunday, 5\/17\r\n\r\nY12 Mixed Saber - 1:30pm - Saturday, 5\/16\r\nY12 Mixed Foil - 12pm - Sunday, 5\/17\r\n\r\nY14 Mixed Saber - 3pm - Saturday, 5\/16\r\nY14 Mixed Foil - 1:30 pm - Sunday, 5\/17\r\nY14 Mixed Epee - 10:30am - Sunday, 5\/17\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Sabre - 4:30 pm - Saturday, 5\/16\r\nSenior Mixed Foil - 3 pm - Sunday, 5\/17\r\nSenior Mixed Epee - 11:30 am - Sunday, 5\/17\r\n\r\nThis scrimmage is being ran and hosted by the Freehold Fencing Academy.
