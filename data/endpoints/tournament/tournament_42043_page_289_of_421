The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Fencers must have current USFA competitive membership and all required protective equipment including 800N glove for saber.\r\n\r\n$35 FOR 1 EVENT (individual)\r\n$55 FOR 2 EVENTS (individual)\r\n$75 FOR 3 EVENTS (individual)\r\n$45 PER TEAM FOR team event\r\n$10 EXTRA FOR THOSE WHO REGISTER AT THE DOOR.\r\n\r\nAge categories:\r\n-Mixed, Men's, Women's, Open, & Team Events: for fencers born 2003 or earlier.\r\n-Y14 events: for fencers born 2002-2005\r\n-Y12 events: for fencers born 2004-2007\r\n-Y10 events: for fencers born 2006-2009\r\n\r\n*NOTE: If less than 4 people preregister for the youth events, they may be combined to make a larger, better event. We will make this call at least 24 hours before the tournament.  (note that combined age events are not sanctioned)\r\n\r\nWe will do our best to e-mail all pre-registered fencers with information about any changes by the Friday night preceding the tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nCall 267-482-9597 with any questions.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nTournament Location:\r\n\r\nLiberty Fencing Club is located at 366 Easton Road, Warrington, PA 18976, between County Line Road and Street Road (on Route 611 across the street from Target & Lowe's). Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597 or Bout Committee at 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISED 2015-16 NO-SHOW POLICY\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\nDue to the need to accurately hire referees, we are sorry, but there can be no refunds for prepayments.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228766,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":142866,"tournament_id":36032,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-12T11:15:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":142867,"tournament_id":36032,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-12T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":142868,"tournament_id":36032,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-12T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":36045,"name":"FAP-NORTH  D2 Epee","start_date":"2017-02-12","end_date":"","comments":"FAP North facility has 7000sq feet of training space, 10 strips, changing rooms, lounge area and wifi.

It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

We will be adjusting things as we learn how such things go, so join in and help us develop!\r\n\r\nWeapons check will be available for your peace of mind, but not required.  800 Newton Saber gloves are required for the sanctioned event, only.\r\n\r\nUtah Swords Academy hosts the Utah Fencing Foundation's wheelchair fencing program and, after separate warmups and drills, we routinely rotate all students to fence seated with our wheelchair fencers.  For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs.  Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated.  If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get really good with blade-work.   Try it - you'll like it!  The Saturday 'Walk and Roll' saber event is schedule between the youth and senior events so that youth can stay after and fence seated and seniors can come early and warm up fencing seated.  Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.

at NEW JERSEY FENCING ALLIANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Regional Junior Cadet Circuit (RJCC) is sanctioned by USA Fencing. RJCCs are a group of events throughout the country for fencers in the junior and cadet age categories in all six weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn regional RJCC points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families. This RJCC will provide a qualifying path for the 2017 July Challenge. Regional RJCC Points will be awarded to all fencers in the competitive field who reside in Region 3. The Athlete\u0092s Handbook :(http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for the July Challenge and should be used as the appropriate reference document.\r\nRJCC tournaments are open to current USFA competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses; however, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in Junior Olympic Fencing Championship events. \r\n\r\nThe RJCC point standings are calculated according to the following guidelines: In each RJCC category (Junior and Cadet) the size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event, regardless of region. Regional RJCC Points are only earned in the fencers own region (for this event, regional points will be awarded to each competitor residing in Region 3 - your Region is assigned based on Division affiliation). RJCC uses this formula: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points). The winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. Best 2 results from RJCCs within the athlete\u0092s region count toward Regional point totals on a rolling point basis.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list using the link in your confirmation email. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n$50 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 2\/22\/17. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).\r\n\r\n$70 at the door for late registrations (after 2\/22\/17) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY).  \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE:  9:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up.

You must be an active member of Metro Tacoma Fencing Club (MTFC) or an active member of one of our affiliated clubs--Washington Fencing Academy or Kitsap Fencing Center--to participate. \r\n\r\nA current 2016-2017 membership to the US Fencing Association (non-competitive membership is fine) is also required for this event due to insurance and liability requirements.\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: MTFC Sharks and Minnows\r\nDate: Feb 26, 2017\r\nClose of Registration: 1 PM\r\nTournament Size Restriction: 24 fencers\r\nLocation: Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Tacoma, WA\r\n\r\nWe are physically located at 1106 South 15th Street, Tacoma, WA 98405 in the Sons of Norway building called \"Normanna Hall\" at the corner of 15th and Martin Luther King. Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 1 PM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $15 for the event.\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT RENTAL: Included for MTFC members, $15 for guests.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. Adults and children with all different levels of experience will be fencing together. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed). \r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $15 for the event, but plan to arrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nThis is a sharks and minnows foil event which is not a typical USFA format but provides better opportunity for practice. We will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools as is standard for USFA tournaments. There will be a second round of pools to follow with a separate \"sharks\" group for the top 6 fencers (after the first round of pools) who will be protected to advance to the direct elimination round. All the \"minnows\" will be sorted based on their first round pool performance for their second round of pools with other minnows. Direct eliminations will follow based on the second round of pools (the sharks have a guaranteed spot) adding some of the top seeded fencers in the minnows group after the second round of pools. Not everyone will advance to direct eliminations though this format will allow two rounds of pools with the second round more equal in fencing strength which is more and better fencing for everyone. It is expected that the direct elimination round will consist of the top 8 fencers only. Those who are eliminated after the pools are encouraged to watch the higher level fencers, ask questions, and learn some new tricks as well as enjoy the company of other MTFC fencers and families.\r\n\r\nThe rounds will be self-directed. Because this will be a mixed tournament with combined youth and adult fencers, direct elimination will be a standard 15 point, 3 period format unless either of the fencers in a direct elimination bout is 10 years old or younger in which case the format will be 10 points, 2 periods as is standard for all 10 and under events. Additionally, if either fencer is veteran age (40 years old and above) the direct elimination rounds can be 10 points, 2 periods as is standard for veteran events.\r\n\r\n------------------ Coach Toby Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis tournament is restricted due to club space availability to the first 24 fencers who preregister on AskFRED. If you register and take a spot but do not show up for the event, Coach Toby will be very disappointed, and you may find that your future in-house registrations may unexpectedly get cancelled. When you register for the event on AskFRED you will receive an e-mail with a link to unregister yourself in case you find that you cannot attend. Please be respectful of other club members.
