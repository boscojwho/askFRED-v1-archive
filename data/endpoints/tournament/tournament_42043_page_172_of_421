USFA rules require each fencer to have a second body cord and a second weapon by the strip; sometimes these may be shared amongst teammates\/friends, however the spare equipment should be at the strip during your bouts. \r\n* Blade length for Y10 fencers must be stamped '0' (30 inches long) or '2' (32 inches).","venue":{"name":"Minnesota Sword Club","address":"4744 Chicago Ave So.","city":"Minneapolis","state":"MN","zip":"55407","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":44.9165569,"longitude":-93.2627998,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":35,"name":"Minnesota","abbrev":"MN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":84464,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T13:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84465,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T11:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84466,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84467,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T14:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84468,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T11:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84469,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":11,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T09:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84470,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T09:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84471,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84472,"tournament_id":20514,"tournament":"Porthos Youth Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-27T12:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20262,"name":"Bay Cup @ EGF: Y10MF; Y12MF","start_date":"2013-01-27","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2012-10-19","prereg_close":"2013-01-24","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":true,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nY10 Men's Foil\r\nY12 Men's Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/30\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/24\/2013.\r\n\r\nThis is a Bay Cup tournament.

The registration fee for each individual tournament is $25.00, and all events can be found on AskFred.net\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the end of the year, teams are ranked and trophies awarded based on the aggregate of points earned by their fencers in all events through the season.

This is especially critical if the fencer does not have a parent\/guardian at check-in.  No one will be allowed to fence without a signed waiver form.\r\n\r\nWaiver Form .PDF --> http:\/\/goo.gl\/97kL5\r\n\r\nNew USA Fencing memberships and new or replacement USA Fencing cards should be obtained through the USA Fencing website before the tournament. http:\/\/goo.gl\/of17o\r\n\r\nAthletes arriving without proof of USA Fencing membership must fill out all appropriate forms and pay for membership at registration even if already a member.  Refund requests can later be made with USA Fencing as appropriate. \r\n\r\nFencers who fail to register by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be made.\r\n\r\nNote that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.  Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nUNIFORMS REQUIREMENTS\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. NAMES ARE NOT REQUIRED ON THE UNIFORM.  AS OF AUGUST 1, 2012, <B>CONDUCTIVE BIBS ARE REQUIRED<\/B> IN ALL FOIL EVENTS.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS\r\nY10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches. Parents and fencers are advised that blades marketed as \"#0\" or \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however blades marketed as #0 or #2 blades that are longer than 32.5 inches, are not permitted.\r\n\r\nEquipment check will be open each day of the competition at 7:00 am. Equipment check will test the mask, lame jacket and foil mask bib, gloves and body cords, as well as any <b>French grip weapons<\/b>. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\" All events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: Underarm plastron, 2nd weapon and body cord, weapon check control marks.  Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nWeapons with grips other than French will not be inspected or marked in advance. Regardless, failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 7-8am on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly.  Those fencing Saturday or Sunday can have their equipment checked Friday anytime after 10am.\r\n\r\nNote that Absolute Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order. \r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\n\r\nSeeding for the Youth events is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking within year classification. Seeding for the Cadet events follows USA Fencing standard practice in which top 16 ranked fencers are seeded first, then by Cadet ranking within each letter classification, then by classification year. Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Clash will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. You can check your USA Fencing rating by downloading and searching for your name here -- http:\/\/goo.gl\/uWUML. You can check your points here -- http:\/\/goo.gl\/FfQ1D\r\n\r\nThis information will be obtained from USA Fencing on Friday, January 25.

It will also be posted at http:\/\/live.capitolclash.com.\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION INFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS\r\n\r\nFailure to report to a strip timely for the start of a bout subjects the fencer to disqualification according to USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nNo flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.

We have teamed up with Sajan Patel to bring our first USF Homeless Program Sock Drive.  Donate new clean white socks - get a raffle ticket for one of the various gift cards we are giving out!  So instead of a present, bring some socks!  \r\n\r\n<i>Why Socks?<\/i>\r\nAccess to shoes and socks is often limited for the homeless men and women living in shelters and on the streets. Rain-soaked feet, ill-fitting shoes, constant standing and diseases like diabetes take their toll on the feet of homeless people. Every day, nurses and physicians treat a huge range of foot ailments - from trench foot to skin infections, to nail diseases.  The best way to prevent such conditions is to keep feet clean and dry \u0096 very difficult if you spend your days outside.\r\n\r\nClean, white socks are a staple of homeless health care and make a real difference.  Or if you want to do more, contact Sajan Patel at sajanspatel1@gmail.com and help out!\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"USF Rec Center, North Gym","address":"4202 E.

Participation qualifies fencers for the Y10 or Y12 competitions at North American Cups (as age appropriate), while the winners of the Y-14 events are qualified for Summer Nationals. With this in mind, the Y14 events will be run as a combined pool round and then the DEs will be split into boys\/girls, with the winner of each qualifying for SN. \r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: NEW FOR 2012-2013: Note: At least 2 athletes must compete (have fenced) in a given RYC age\/weapon event to fulfill eligibility requirements for the Y10 and\/or Y12 NAC or for a first place finish to result in qualification to the Y14 Summer National Championships. Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed will not result in the athlete fulfilling qualification requirement. i.e. Y14 events will need to have at least two athletes of the same gender to be a qualifying event.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must be a current USFA member (or complete the application at the door), and bring their membership card. Full USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or sabre, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. All Y10 fencers will be required to use size \"0\" or size \"2\" blades (i.e., less than 32.5 inches long). Foil events will be conducted with the new foil mask requirement\r\n\r\nEquipment checks are conducted at RYC events held in the Portland area. Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event. Limited types of replacement equipment are available at NWFC (Beaverton).\r\n\r\nAge Requirements (2012-2013 Season only):\r\nY10: Birth years of 2002 - 2005\r\nY12: Birth years of 2000 - 2003\r\nY14: Birth years of 1998 - 2001\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFred is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Wednesday Jan. 30, 2013 (i.e. TWO days before the event) If you are pre-registered by the deadline, pay just $15 per fencer registration fee and $10 per event at the door (i.e. $25 for one event and $35 for two events.) After the close of regular pre-registration time to midnight of the day prior to the tournament, fencers are welcome at triple registration fee and double event fee (i.e. $45 to register and $20 per event), if board notified prior to midnight Friday. The day of the event you may fence with a walk-in fee of double triple (i.e. $90 per fencer and $60 per event.) However, we don\u0092t want that, so please just register on time and save yourself some money.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that we only accept cash or checks at Division events. CREDIT CARDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED. Please make checks out to the Oregon Division\/USFA. \r\n\r\nHealthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area. Thanks to parent volunteers, we anticipate offering an affordable lunch (taco bar meal with drink, salad and dessert) for $3, similar to the BBQ meal offered during our 9\/9\/12 RYC.
