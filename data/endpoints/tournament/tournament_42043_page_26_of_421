First round of pools placed the fencers in either the top or bottom pool for the second round.  Second round determined final standing.  The results list not keyed to pools is the correct final list.  The larger list that is keyed to pools shows the first round and the top pool of the second round (plus barrage for first place).  The smaller list shows the results for the top pool.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nUnrated Cadet (U17) Mixed Foil\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed Foil\r\n<b>Events will be combined unless there are 6 or more fencers in each age group, in which case the events will be fenced concurrently.

Late entry fee $30 for registrations on 2\/12\/2007 or later.\r\n\r\nFAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in convertion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers (total for combined event). If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nPre-registered fencers - if you are unable to attend, PLEASE delete your registration so that others can sign up.
