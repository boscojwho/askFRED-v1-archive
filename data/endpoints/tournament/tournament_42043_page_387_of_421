The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Competitors regularly attend from up and down the East Coast and are always welcome.\r\n\r\nThe Cup was interrupted during the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 seasons by COVID-19 and we hope to host a complete Cup series this season. The organizers understand the concerns that many fencers will have regarding health and safety protocols . For this reason, the organizers have communicated an expectation to each club hosting an event that they will meet or exceed the standard set for NACs (masking at all times and proof of vaccination or recent negative test) in addition to complying with all local laws. While the organizers will attempt to provide updates via social media, given the speed with which policies can change, the most definitive information regarding health and safety protocols will always be found by calling the club hosting the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WILL THE CUP WINNER DETERMINED?\r\n\r\nIn addition to individual event awards, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2021-2022 Cup Standings at the end of the season will be recognized. Awards will be given after the season's final event. 2021-2022 Cup Standings will be determined as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Each fencer will get credit for points earned at up to three 2021-2022 Cup events (assuming the currently anticipated five events; if a sixth event is added, points can be earned at up to four events)\r\n\r\n2. For each 2021-2022 Cup event, fencers will receive points based on their finish and letter ratings of other participants who finish below them:\r\na. Each fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)\r\nb. Fencers will earn points equal to the sum of the point values of all fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points\r\nc. In the case of Vet Mixed Events, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) below them\r\n\r\n3. Ties in the Cup Standings will be resolved in favor of the fencer that received the higher number of points at a single Cup event\r\n\r\n\r\n2021-2022 TRI-STATE VETERANS SABER CUP \u00e2\u0080\u0093 CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED EVENTS\r\n\r\nOctober 24, 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Lilov Fencing Academy\r\nDecember 12, 2021 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manhattan Fencing Center\r\nFebruary 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 TBD\r\nSpring 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Sheridan Fencing\r\nJune 12, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Infinity Fencing Alliance\r\n\r\nPlease note that there are no refunds for this event.

No further entries will be accepted.\r\n\r\nWith the list of attendees now known, several events will not need to be fenced.  The following events WILL NOT be fenced and all of the registered fencers will be marked as qualified:\r\n\r\n- Junior Women's Saber\r\n- Junior Women's Foil\r\n- Cadet Women's Epee\r\n- Cadet Women's Foil\r\n- Cadet Women's Saber\r\n- Cadet Men's Epee\r\n\r\nThe following events will be fenced this weekend at Rain City Fencing Center according to the following schedule:\r\n\r\n- Junior Women's Epee: Saturday 12\/18 at 2pm\r\n- Junior Men's Epee: Saturday 12\/18 at 2pm\r\n- Junior Men's Foil: Saturday 12\/18 at 2pm\r\n- Junior Men's Saber: Sunday 12\/19 at 2pm\r\n- Cadet Men's Foil: Saturday 12\/18 following the conclusion of Junior Men's Foil (if it is necessary to be fenced)\r\n- Cadet Men's Saber: Sunday 12\/19 following the conclusion of Junior Men's Saber (if it is necessary to be fenced)\r\n\r\n(Note: We have done our best to schedule these events to avoid overlap with events being held at the RCFC \"Home for the Holidays\" event, as well as other events in the area.)\r\n\r\nAll of the fencers attending events this weekend will be required to pay an $10 in CASH (per event) upon arrival.  This is in addition to the $10 you paid when you registered on AskFred and is used to cover the cost of hiring referees.\r\n\r\nSince this is a qualifier, full USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Saber fencers must have the 800N glove.  We will inspect and mark masks, lames, body cords, head cords, and gloves. Equipment inspection will start one hour prior to the listed start time for each event.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASE READ - IMPORTANT CHANGES TO JO QUALIFIERS THIS YEAR\r\n\r\nFencers who want to fence at JOs in February must qualify at this event unless they have sufficient national or regional points. In each event, the top 25% (rounded up) will qualify for JOs, with a minimum of 3.  Therefore, if 3 or fewer fencers are registered for an event, the event will not be fenced and all will qualify.\r\n\r\nFencers that earn qualification at the Junior events will automatically for the corresponding Cadet event if they are age-eligible.\r\n\r\nWe are implementing the same process for JO Qualifiers that we used in 2019.  This process will save everyone time and money.  Please read the following carefully.\r\n\r\nFirst, all entries must be pre-registered and paid on AskFred by 11:59 PM on December 13th.  NO ENTRIES WILL BE ALLOWED AFTER THE ENTRY DEADLINE.\r\n\r\nAfter the entry deadline, we will send an email announcing the following:\r\n\r\nIf an event has 3 or fewer fencers that are not already qualified, the event will not be fenced.  All of the fencers that are registered will be considered qualified.\r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, we will announce where and when the event will be held.\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Entry Fees ---------\r\nAll fencers must pay the mandatory $10 registration fee when they sign up on AskFred.  \r\n\r\nIf an event needs to be fenced, each fencer will need to pay an ADDITIONAL $10 in CASH on the day of the event (to cover the cost of hiring referees.)\r\n\r\n\r\n-------- Tournament Rules -------- \r\nCadet events are open to fencers born in 2005-2008.\r\nJunior events are open to fencers born in 2002-2008.\r\n\r\nSince this is a national qualifier, all competitors must be current members of the USFA Western Washington Division and US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n \r\nPlease join or renew your USFA membership online at https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-individual-memberships prior to registering on AskFred.\r\n\r\nFor events that are fenced, full USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Saber fencers must have the 800N glove.\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark masks, lames, body cords, head cords, and gloves. Equipment inspection will be done on the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to pre-register online with
