Please ensure that the equipment you sell is clean and in good shape. If you are not sure if your used equipment is in good condition, bring it anyway, and we can evaluate its condition. Important: Please provide contact information (name, telephone, e-mail) at the table, so that buyers may be in touch with sellers.
