There will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the\r\n\r\nUSFA 2008-2009 age requirements:\r\nYouth-8: born in 2000-2003\r\nYouth-10: born in 1998-2001\r\nYouth-12: born in 1996-1999\r\nYouth-14: born in 1994-1997\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.\r\nThe first series will end at Youth Progressive #4 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4.\r\n\r\nThe second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8. Trophies will be awarded for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil,\r\nYouth-12 Foil,Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.\r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1. Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event. If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2. Events are mixed (boys and girls). Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender. (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3. Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments. Point standings will be posted at http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4. The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series. For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/14\/2008.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/22\/2008.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"NorthWest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Aveue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.48434,"longitude":-122.782564,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":28998,"tournament_id":6412,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #4","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-24T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":28999,"tournament_id":6412,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #4","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-24T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29000,"tournament_id":6412,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #4","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-24T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29001,"tournament_id":6412,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #4","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-24T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29002,"tournament_id":6412,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #4","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-24T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29003,"tournament_id":6412,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #4","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-24T14:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5173,"name":"RCFC Thursday Night E & Under Foil #3 (07-08)","start_date":"2008-01-24","end_date":"","comments":"RCFC presents our first Thursday night E & Under Foil tournament of the new year!

This year, there will be a cumulative point system, allowing the top 8 fencers in each age category to win great trophies, twice a year.\r\n\r\nYouth Progressive tournaments are open to all USFA members* meeting the USFA 2007-2008 age requirements: \r\nYouth-8:  born in 1999-2002\r\nYouth-10: born in 1997-2000\r\nYouth-12: born in 1995-1998\r\nYouth-14: born in 1993-1996\r\n\r\n(Fencers who are on the USFA national point standings in one age bracket are also eligible to compete in the next higher age bracket.)\r\n\r\nThe Youth Progressive tournaments will be held in 2 series.  The first series will end at <b>this tournament<\/b> and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #1-4; the second series will end at Youth Progressive #8 and will be based on points earned in the Youth Progressive tournaments #5-8.  Trophies will be awarded at <b>this tournament<\/b> for the top 8 point standings in Youth-8 Foil, Youth-10 Foil, Youth-12 Foil, Youth-12 Epee, Youth-14 Foil and Youth-14 Epee.  \r\n\r\nHere's how the point system works:\r\n\r\n1.  Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event.  The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event.  If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2.  Events are mixed (boys and girls).  Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender.  (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3.  Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments.  Point standings will be posted at www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4.  The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series.  For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n------------------\r\nSchedule (close of registration times & award ceremony times):\r\n\r\n9:00am: Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n10:30am Y8 Foil\r\n12:30pm Awards ceremony for Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee & Y8 Foil\r\n\r\n1:00pm: Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil\r\n2:30: Y12 Epee\r\n5:00pm Awards ceremony for Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil & Y12 Epee\r\n-------------------\r\nCost: $10 preregistration fee ($15 at the door), plus $10 per event.\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for fencers born in 2000 or earlier years, and can be purchased or renewed online or at the door.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/12\/2007.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/25\/2008.","venue":{"name":"NorthWest Fencing Center","address":"4950 SW Western Ave","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":45.48434,"longitude":-122.782564,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":20143,"tournament_id":4387,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #4 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-26T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20144,"tournament_id":4387,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #4 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-26T14:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20145,"tournament_id":4387,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #4 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-26T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20146,"tournament_id":4387,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #4 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-26T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20147,"tournament_id":4387,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #4 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-26T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":20148,"tournament_id":4387,"tournament":"NWFC Youth Progressive #4 (& Trophy Awards)","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-01-26T10:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4901,"name":"FVFA 3-Weapon Unclassified","start_date":"2008-01-26","end_date":"2008-01-27","comments":"Tournament will be mixed unless at least 6 fencers enter.
