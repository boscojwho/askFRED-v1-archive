Other competitive opportunities in the ROC tournaments are provided for Veteran (40 & Older) and Division II (C, D, E or U) fencers.   ROC tournaments are open to current USA Fencing competitive members eligible to fence in Open competitions and to foreign fencers with current FIE licenses.   However, foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USA Fencing National Championship events. In the event that a foreign fencer finishes within the qualifying group, the foreign fencer will be skipped and only the highest-finishing eligible domestic fencers will qualify. \r\n\r\nIn each ROC category (Division I-A, Division II, and Veterans) competitions will award points to the top 40% of the competitive field (rounded up to the next higher integer) to a maximum of 64th place, using the point tables for regional competitions found in The Athlete\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds Handbook  Appendix 2.5.   Only the best 3 results, in each respective category, count towards the point total. These points may qualify D1A, DV2, and Veteran ROC fencers to the USA Fencing National Championships in D1A, DV2, DV3, and Veteran.    The ROC point standings are not used for seeding National level tournaments.  Only ROC events award regional ranking points.\r\n\r\n**Entry is determined by 2018-19 USA Fencing birth year requirements and rating restrictions: \r\n\r\nDiv I-A (any rating): Born 2005 or before, or on the Junior National Rolling Points List \r\n\r\nDiv2  (C,D,E or U rating): Born 2005 or before\r\n\r\nCadet: Born in 2002 through 2005; Fencers with Youth-14 National points are eligible to fence in Cadet events.\r\n\r\nJunior: Born in 1999 through 2005; Fencers with Cadet National points are eligible to fence in Junior events.\r\n\r\n<b><I>Cadet and Junior events are non-regional, and no points are awarded.
