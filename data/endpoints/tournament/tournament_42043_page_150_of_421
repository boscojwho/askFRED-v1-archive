It should NOT BE EXPIRED.\r\nBe on time. Don't bother trying to call us... you are either there or you aren't. We will not be holding up events for you or putting you in a pool because you are \"on your way\". Traffic, weather and parade delays should be planned for.\r\nBelong, as stated on the USFA card you will have with you and\/or on the USFA master membership list, to the Metropolitan Division\/Section. If your USFA card and the USFA membership list do not show that you belong to the Metropolitan Division\/Section, we absolutely positively will not let you fence. We don't care where your family lives, where you go to school, what club you occasionally practice at, who your coach is, or who you talked to at the national office... YOU WILL NOT FENCE.\r\nBe of the correct age for the events you are participating in. Age restrictions are listed in the US Fencing Athlete's Handbook (available through the link above). If you are considering attending national championships, you should have already downloaded and read the Athlete's Handbook cover to cover (twice). We will be generous and tell you that age restrictions are covered in section 2.5, titled \"Eligibility to Compete\".\r\n\r\nPlease note that there is no leeway for \"close\" in the age guidelines. If your birthday was December 31st before the minimum year or January 1st after the latest year of the event you want to be in, tough cookies.\r\n\r\nDivision 3 Qualification to National Championships\r\nPlease note that per USFA guidelines there are no Division 3 qualifying events. Qualification for Division 3 events is through qualification in Div 1A, Div 2, U19 or U16 in the same weapon, or by placing in the top 25% of D & Under fencers in the Division 2 qualifying event that don't otherwise qualify. Therefore if you want to qualify for Division 3 events, it is recommended that you enter the Division 2 qualifying event in the same weapon. If this is unclear to you, please read the Athlete's Handbook.\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes\r\nWe cannot stress enough that we STRONGLY recommend that all fencers interested in attending national championships read the Athlete's Handbook, with a special focus on chapter 2. Especially 2.5 (Eligibility to Compete); 2.7 (What is a Qualifier); 2.8 (Appeal\/Petition Process); and 2.11 (Specific Events). We also recommend that you know, by heart, the qualifying paths for any events you want to fence in at nationals.&nbsp;You MUST show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and WILL NOT be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration.&nbsp;BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\nAs outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse. We will be highly unsympathetic towards any excuses short of natural disaster, war and\/or death (and for those at war, you technically belong to the National Division, so even that won't work!).\r\n\r\nLocation\r\n\r\nThe New York Athletic Club is located at 180 Central Park South, in Manhattan.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73961,"tournament_id":17593,"tournament":"Div. 3 Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-04-22T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":18361,"name":"Earth Day Epee Open @ Medeo","start_date":"2012-04-22","end_date":"","comments":"Take advantage of our $30 event fee when you prepay by Saturday, 4\/21!

This team will be headed by one or two coaches, chosen from all of that school district\u0092s coaches.  Normally there is a participation limit of one girls team and one boys team per school district, but this year we are waiving this rule in order to field as many teams possible.  Therefore each school district may enter as many teams and fencers as they wish for the All-State tournament.  \r\n\r\nAs an example of how we in the San Francisco High School District choose our All-State team.  We select our team members at our S.F. All-City Tournament, which is held at the end of the fencing season at an individual boys and girls event.  For the boy\u0092s team, up to an additional four boys are voted by all coaches as the All-City Team.  At the end of the All-City Meet, a boy\u0092s team and girl\u0092s team plus coaches are selected from all of our high schools to represent San Francisco in the All-State Tournament.\r\n\r\nThe All-State tournament this year will host girls and boys individual events.  We encourage each district to field any number of girls they wish in a girl\u0092s individual tournament.  The format for both the boys and girls events will be pools, followed by direct eliminations with fence-off for third, where points will be earned by the final placing.  The total points for the top three placing girls or boys from each district will be added together to determine the first place school districts in the girls and boys teams event.  \r\nThe first place team trophy for boys and the first place team trophy for girls are perpetual trophies, which have been in the school systems for years.\r\n\r\nTo enter a team, a letter requesting a seat in the All-State tournament is needed from each school district wishing to participate.  \r\nThis letter is required, along with $30.00 (to cover the costs of prizes and gym rental).  Please make out the check to Pannonia Athletic Club, and bring both to the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst place boys team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\nFirst place girls team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\n\r\nThere will also be 24 medals awarded for:\r\n\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place teams (boys and girls, 3 medals per team)\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place individual(boys and girls)\r\n\r\nNO USFA membership is required, no ratings will be awarded. \r\nAll other USFA rules and regulations apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they are pre-qualified as described below.)\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.

If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\nIf you have already qualified for Div II\/III\/Y14 through another means (see below), you can still attend this event.  You won't \"take up\" a qualification since you are already qualified - instead, you'll help the numbers but will be skipped when awarding qualifications.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule -----\r\nSaturday 4\/28\/12:\r\n10:00am -- Div II\/III Men's Foil  &  Div II\/III Women's Epee\r\n1:00pm  -- Div II\/III Men's Saber  &  Div II\/III Women's Foil\r\n\r\nSunday 4\/29\/12:\r\n10:00am -- Div II\/III Men's Epee  &  Y14 Men's Saber\r\nNoon    -- Div II\/III Women's Saber\r\n1:00pm  -- Y14 Men's Foil  &  Y14 Women's Foil\r\n2:00pm  -- Y14 Men's Epee  &  Y14 Women's Saber \r\n3:00pm  -- Y14 Women's Epee\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe registration fee is $20 per event.  \r\n\r\nRegistration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm PDT on Wednesday April 25th.  If you do not register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nEvent fees must be paid in cash or by check (made to \"WWD\") at the door.  We DO NOT accept credit or debit cards.   \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=15764\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nEvents with 14 or fewer fencers will be run as a single round of pools followed by a direct elimination.\r\n\r\nEvents with 15 or more fencers will be run as TWO rounds of pools followed by a direct elimination.  The combined results from the two pool rounds will be used to seed the DE tableau.  In events with more than 20 fencers, we will do a cut after the second round of pools (top 16 promoted to DEs.)\r\n\r\nThis two-rounds-of-pools format has proven to be popular with the fencers since it gives everyone a lot of fencing.  It also tends to \"smooth out\" the seeding - if you fence poorly in the first round of pools, you can redeem yourself by fencing well in the second round.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\nUSA Fencing has does not require the electric foil mask bib for non-national events, so \"standard\" foil\/epee masks may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 1998 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 1997 - 2000\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14.  If you qualified for Division I-A at a ROC like the Battle in Seattle, you are already qualified for Div II\/III.  Some fencers also qualified for Division II\/III at the ROC held in Tacoma back in September.  Y14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event.\r\n\r\nThe USFA tracks who has already qualified on the USFA website.  Visit http:\/\/usfencing.org\/events\/5868\/page\/13271 and click the \"Auto Qualifiers\" link to see the spreadsheet of qualified fencers.  Check the spreadsheet for your name to see if you are listed as pre-qualified.  If you are unsure, ASK YOUR COACH!\r\n\r\nPre-qualified fencers are still welcome to fence at this event, since it helps the numbers and does not deny someone else a qualifier slot.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict (such as being out of town on business.)  \r\n\r\nContact chair@wwdfencing.org for more info on petitions.","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"760 Harrison

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":77173,"tournament_id":18476,"tournament":"Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-04-29T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17456,"name":"Roc City Open Foil and Sabre Series #3","start_date":"2012-04-29","end_date":"","comments":"The RFC hosts the \u0093ROC City Open\" for Foil and Sabre.
