In 1995, the wolf, an integral member of the wilderness ecosystem, was reintroduced to Yellowstone Park.  The Wolf Project studies the long-term impact on the Park's ecosystem.  Last year, Fences With Wolves raised enough money to buy two radio collars for the Wolf Project.  As a thank-you, the Yellowstone Park Foundation sent us a wonderful cast of a paw print. We are having this made into a special trophy and the winners of both this year's and last year's events will have their names engraved on it. \r\n\r\nParticipants in this youth fundraiser are encouraged (but not required) to join the pack and seek sponsors to back them as they battle for the title of Alpha Wolf. Sponsorship forms, allowing sponsors to pledge per point scored, will be emailed to preregistrants. Fencer\/fundraisers will receive a special commemorative wristband.  After the competition, sponsors will receive an email with their pledge amount and a link for online donation.\r\n\r\nWe have wolf-themed prizes for medalists, as well as a prize in each age group for the fencer with the greatest number of sponsors.\r\n\r\nThe fundraising web site is:  http:\/\/www.ypf.org\/site\/TR?px=1102981&fr_id=1078&pg=personal\r\n\r\nRegistration fee is $35 for preregistered fencers and $45 at the door.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 8 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you're not sure how to do that, click on the Email the Tournament Organizer\u009d link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why do this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00a6 it's not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  That's the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence.   \r\n\r\n \r\nPre-registration closes 24 hours prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":91755,"tournament_id":22737,"tournament":"FAP Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC AGES 13+","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-08T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19415,"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Unclassified Foil","start_date":"2013-06-08","end_date":"","comments":"Pre-registered here for $35; register at the door for $50.

You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1998-2001\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19709\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/07\/2013\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87627,"tournament_id":21423,"tournament":"FAP Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":13,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-09T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22705,"name":"Windy City Fencing Youth & Open Epee","start_date":"2013-06-09","end_date":"","comments":"$30 for preregistration ($35 at door).

USFA Membership can be paid online: http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership. Please bring USFA card or receipt with you.\r\n* USFA rules will be enforced. With regard to safety, each fencer must wear full fencing clothing, including a plastron (under-arm protector), plastic chest protector (women), knickers, and long socks. Masks will be punch-tested for safety at the event.\r\n* USFA rules require each fencer to have a second body cord and a second weapon by the strip.\r\n* FOIL Fencers must have new conductive bib requirement.\r\n\r\nNEW PRE-PAYMENT OPTION & NO-SHOWS\r\n*In order to ensure fair and high-quality tournaments, RedStar Fencing Club chooses to hire USFA Directors to work at our tournaments.  Because of the amount of no-call or no shows, it's difficult to compensate Directors who are confirmed in advance. To help promote the pre-payment option, we have reduced our rate to $20 if you use the pre-payment method.  Pre-payment is NON-REFUNDABLE, NON-TRANSFERABLE.  If you are not sure if you can make it, just pre-register without pre-pay.  You can always go back into your AskFred Account and pre-pay up until the cut-off date. AskFred charges an extra $0.99 fee.  \r\n\r\n*For those who pre-register, please UN-REGISTER yourself or email\/call us if you cannot attend our events. Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season. After the 3rd infringement, your registration will need pre-approval, and an additional fee of $10 will be collected and DONATED to the American Red Cross upon check-in.  \r\n\r\ne: hello[at]redstarfencing.com    \"@\" replaces [at]\r\np: +1 773 349 3074\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/17\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on FRI 06\/07\/2013 at 11:59PM CT.\r\n","venue":{"name":"REDSTAR FENCING CLUB","address":"3735 W BELMONT AVE","city":"CHICAGO","state":"IL","zip":"60618","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":41.9391022,"longitude":-87.7211832,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":85122,"tournament_id":20684,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, C&U F, Vet F","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-09T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":85123,"tournament_id":20684,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, C&U F, Vet F","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-09T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":85124,"tournament_id":20684,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, C&U F, Vet F","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-09T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":85125,"tournament_id":20684,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, C&U F, Vet F","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":22,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-09T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":19416,"name":"Brooklyn Fencing C & Under, E & Under Foil","start_date":"2013-06-09","end_date":"","comments":"$35\/event for fencers pre-registered on AskFRED; $50 walk-ins at the door.
