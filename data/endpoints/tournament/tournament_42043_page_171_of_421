You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1998-2001\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19700\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/11\/2013\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you are not sure if you can make it, just pre-register without pre-pay.  You can always go back into your AskFred Account and pre-pay up until the cut-off date. AskFred charges an extra $0.99 fee.  \r\n\r\n*For those who pre-register, please UN-REGISTER yourself or email\/call us if you cannot attend our events. Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season. After the 3rd infringement, your registration will need pre-approval, and an additional fee of $10 will be collected and DONATED to the American Red Cross upon check-in.  \r\n\r\ne: hello[at]redstarfencing.com    \"@\" replaces [at]\r\np: +1 773 349 3074\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/17\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on FRI 01\/11\/2013 at 11:59PM CT.\r\n","venue":{"name":"REDSTAR FENCING CLUB","address":"3735 W BELMONT AVE","city":"CHICAGO","state":"IL","zip":"60618","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":41.9391022,"longitude":-87.7211832,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":85113,"tournament_id":20682,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, SrMxF, Vet F","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-13T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":85114,"tournament_id":20682,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, SrMxF, Vet F","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-13T08:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":85115,"tournament_id":20682,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, SrMxF, Vet F","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-13T12:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":20945,"name":"GFA Foil Open","start_date":"2013-01-13","end_date":"","comments":"49 max per event. paid registration priority. $35 per event paid pre-registeration.\r\n$40 per event pre-registered.\r\nfencers may register at the door for $45. \r\nEvent is now mixed and the registration closes at 1pm","prereg_open":"2012-12-20","prereg_close":"2013-01-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":10,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"49 max per event. paid registration priority. $35 per event paid pre-registeration.\r\n$40 per event pre-registered.\r\nfencers may register at the door for $45. \r\n\r\nRegistration closing time:\r\nSenior Mixed Foil :1pm\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 12\/20\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/12\/2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Gutkovskiy Fencing Academy","address":"18-02 River road, Building 1, Unit 2","city":"Fair Lawn","state":"NJ","zip":"07410","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.939704,"longitude":-74.14219,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":86099,"tournament_id":20945,"tournament":"GFA Foil Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":35,"prereg_count":42,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-13T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"25.00"}]},{"id":20947,"name":"New England Youth Epee Grand Prix I","start_date":"2013-01-13","end_date":"","comments":"This is the first of eight Y-14 Mixed Epee tournaments held alternately at Vivo Fencing Club and Olympia Fencing Center.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":86187,"tournament_id":20982,"tournament":"FAP Div 3 Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":12,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20473,"name":"Nyack Fencing's Sabre Series no. 2","start_date":"2013-01-13","end_date":"","comments":"Deadline for Registration has been extended till 1\/12 at Midnight.\r\n\r\nPlease see more info for complete details for full details and fees.","prereg_open":"2012-10-22","prereg_close":"2013-01-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":30,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"This tournament series is designed to offer a wide range of events to help develop beginner sabre fencers of all levels w\/ as many bouts in a professional competitive environment.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":86188,"tournament_id":20983,"tournament":"FAP Unclassified Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":20,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-01-20T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20991,"name":"York OCC 2013","start_date":"2013-01-20","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2012-12-27","prereg_close":"2013-01-18","authority":"CFF","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Registration is $10 + $25 per event. \r\n\r\nA late fee of $5 + $10 per event will be added if registering after Friday, January 18th.\r\n\r\nPlease note that, in the event of a conflict, fencers will be asked to choose one event to compete in and drop out of another.
