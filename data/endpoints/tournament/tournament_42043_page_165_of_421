Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.

There are two ways to be sure you are affiliated with South Texas PRIOR to the qualifier:\r\n\r\n1.  Go to http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\/current-membership-listing and select the South Texas Division from the center dropdown menu at the bottom of the page.  If your name appears, your affiliation SHOULD be correct.\r\n\r\n2.  Visit https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/Login.aspx?Redirect=Profile.aspx?returnurl=default.aspx and access your user profile.  Verify that your division listing is correct.  Take the time to verify your club information as well, since that club affiliation is what we are required to use to seed the events.\r\n\r\nIf either or both of these methods do not show you affiliated with South Texas Division, but you feel you should attend our qualifiers, contact the National Office by phone or email to request your information be updated.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\nMasks, body and mask cords, lames and saber manchettes\/gloves will be tested.\r\n\r\nFencers may and are encouraged to fence in all events on a given day, but in order to keep the tournament on schedule, no three- or ten-minute rest will be given in one event for a bout just fenced in a different event.\r\n\r\nEvents will be fenced as one round of pools (if there are at least four non-autoqualified fencers) with 100% promotion to DEs. If fewer than four non-auto-qualified fencers register for an individual event, the organizers reserve the option not to conduct any fencing for the event, and declare all fencers to have qualified.  Would-be qualifiers must show up and pay their event fee in order to be considered qualified, even if no fencing is conducted.\r\n\r\nAll participants must sign a Waiver of Liability. Anyone under age 18 must have a parent's or legal guardian's signature on this form. \r\n\r\nThe waiver is available at http:\/\/southtexasdivision.org\/media\/forms\/sotxwaiverconsent.pdf for your convenience.","venue":{"name":"San Antonio Fencing Center","address":"435 Isom Road, Suite 208","city":"San
