IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $4.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc [at] gmail [dot] com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.268185,"longitude":-123.249992,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":41070,"tournament_id":9442,"tournament":"Spring Cleaning Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-18T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":41071,"tournament_id":9442,"tournament":"Spring Cleaning Tournament 2010","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-18T09:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11504,"name":"Bill Hull Memorial Tournament","start_date":"2010-04-18","end_date":"","comments":"Free Parking in Structure on west side of SRC or Structure on NW corner of Rural Rd and Lemon St.(just north of Apache Blvd.)","prereg_open":"2010-04-05","prereg_close":"2010-04-17","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Free Parking in Structure on west side of SRC or Structure on NW corner of Rural Rd and Lemon St.(just north of Apache Blvd.)\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\nMixed Foil\r\nMixed Saber\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFred $15\r\nRegistration at door $20\r\nEvent Fee $5\r\n(you may compete in multiple events)\r\nPreregistration opens on 04\/05\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/17\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"ASU Student Recreation Complex","address":"400 E.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.

Seeding will be based upon current USFA and AFL ratings.  \r\n\r\nThree-weapon bouts are fought for 8 points. The first weapon fenced is <b>foil<\/b>. When the aggregate score reaches 5 or when three minutes of fencing time have elapsed, the fencers switch to <b>sabre<\/b> and the fencing continues. If and when the aggregate score reaches 10 or when a second three minutes of fencing time have elapsed, the fencers will switch to <b>\u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a9e<\/b>. The bout will end when one fencer reaches eight points or when the third three minutes of fencing time expire. There will be a one-minute rest between periods, during which the fencer may receive coaching advice from one designated person. The fencer may not leave the strip without permission. If the score is tied at the end of the third period, USFA rules for priority and overtime will be used.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the USFA rules for non-combativity will be used. Basically, if a minute goes by without at least an attempt to score, then the director will declare that the fencers are unwilling to fight and will issue a Group I penalty to both fencers and instruct the fencers to immediately switch weapons without rest or benefit of coaching. See USFA rule t.87 for more information.\r\n\r\nFor complete rules, visit: http:\/\/www.americanfencingleague.org \r\nPlease note that the weapon order, time limits, and non-combativity rules are deviations from the AFL rules for three-weapon combined events. All fencers are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the AFL rules\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially with regard to the penalty chart, strip lengths, and right of way.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salem Classical Fencing","address":"354 Belmont Street NE","city":"Salem","state":"OR","zip":"97301","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48955,"tournament_id":11366,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial Multi-Weapon (AFL & USFA)","full_name":"Mixed One-touch (AFL) Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"One-touch (AFL)","close_of_reg":"2010-04-25T16:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":48957,"tournament_id":11366,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial Multi-Weapon (AFL & USFA)","full_name":"Mixed (AFL Novice & under) Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"(AFL Novice & under)","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":49226,"tournament_id":11366,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial Multi-Weapon (AFL & USFA)","full_name":"Mixed Three-weapon (not just Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Three-weapon (not just","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":49227,"tournament_id":11366,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial Multi-Weapon (AFL & USFA)","full_name":"U16 Mixed Epee","short_name":"U16MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"U16","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-25T12:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":49228,"tournament_id":11366,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial Multi-Weapon (AFL & USFA)","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Epee","short_name":"VCmMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-25T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":49229,"tournament_id":11366,"tournament":"Russ Heggen Memorial Multi-Weapon (AFL & USFA)","full_name":"Mixed (AFL Novice & under) Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"(AFL Novice & under)","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T15:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11634,"name":"Spring Fever Tournament","start_date":"2010-04-24","end_date":"","comments":"This event is FREE but we ask that you bring a donation of gently used clothing or food to help the needy.\r\n\r\nPlease call 435-901-3288 if you're running late.\r\n\r\nUSFA membership required.","prereg_open":"2010-04-21","prereg_close":"2010-04-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"UVSF","address":"728 S State Street","city":"Orem","state":"UT","zip":"84058","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":12,"name":"Utah-Southern Idaho","abbrev":"UT-SID","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":50022,"tournament_id":11634,"tournament":"Spring Fever Tournament","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T16:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11382,"name":"La Div Championshps and Summer Nationals Qualifier","start_date":"2010-04-24","end_date":"","comments":"All fencers must be current competitive La.

This is a qualifying event for Division 2, Division 3, Jr. Team & Sr. Team events to summer nationals. All fencers must be born 1996 or earlier, be current USFA members and have all required gear. If you sign up for membership online please, bring the confirmation page with you to the tournament. \r\n\r\nSome details about the tournament:\r\nDivision 2 events are for fencers C & under. The top 25% (minimum of 4 fencers) will qualify\r\nDivision 3 events are for fencers D & under. The top 25% (minimum of 4 fencers) will qualify\r\nBecause we hold these events together then the top 25% of the fencers in the total event will qualify for Division 2 & 3. The top 25% of the remainder will qualify for Division 3 only. \r\n\r\nTeam events require a minimum of 3 fencers per team fielded. Fencers must all be from the same club for that club to fence. A fielded team that qualifies to nationals does not have to consist of the team that was present at the qualifier. The qualifier is solely for qualifying TEAMS to the nationals. The fee to field a team at the qualifier is $15\/team. All fencers must meet minimum age requirements and be USFA members. \r\n\r\nSince often times there aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t enough fencers from one club to field a team, if there are less than 2 teams registered on the day of the event, a mixed team match will be fenced for fun and those teams registered will automatically qualify.\r\n\r\nPlease go to \"who's pre-registered\" to see date and time of events. Please note times listed are CLOSE OF CHECK-IN.

To make the experience more informative and less stressful Youth Progressives will be done a bit differently:\r\n\r\nThe BFC will make extra electrical equipment available for athletes.\r\n\r\nCompetitors do not need to be members of the USFA.\r\n\r\nArmorers will be available to explain how the equipment works and repair equipment that fails inspection.\r\n\r\nReferees will go over the hand signals and explain how the pool works to the athletes and parents.\r\n\r\nBout committee personnel will explain how the competition will run to athletes and parents.\r\n\r\nWhen\/if an infraction occurs, the referees will explain the particular rule to the competitor and offer a suggestion to fix the issue before handing out warnings.\r\n\r\nThe event will be on askfred.net to help the athletes learn about signing up and at a reduced rate ($10 registrations fee PLUS $5 per event) for those that sign up in a timely fashion.  The fee at the door will be $10 registration fee PLUS $10 per event.\r\n\r\nThere will be an awards table for the top 8 finishers to choose their prize. First place picks first, 2nd place next etc.\r\n\r\nAgain, Youth Progressives are fun fencing events designed to help young athletes (and parents) to learn about and prepare for competitions.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nUnrated Y10 Mixed Foil\r\nUnrated Y12 Mixed Epee\r\nUnrated Y12 Mixed Foil\r\nUnrated Y12 Mixed Saber\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed 15-year-olds may fence Epee\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed 15-year-olds may fence Foil\r\nUnrated Y14 Mixed 15-year-olds may fence Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 04\/05\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/23\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Boston Fencing Club","address":"110 Clematis Ave #2","city":"Waltham","state":"MA","zip":"02452","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":42.383497,"longitude":-71.20357,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":49522,"tournament_id":11498,"tournament":"BFC Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed 15 year-olds may fence Saber","short_name":"U-Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"15 year-olds may fence","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":49523,"tournament_id":11498,"tournament":"BFC Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":49524,"tournament_id":11498,"tournament":"BFC Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed 15 year olds may fence Epee","short_name":"U-Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"15 year olds may fence","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":49525,"tournament_id":11498,"tournament":"BFC Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed 15 year olds may fence Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"15 year olds may fence","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":49526,"tournament_id":11498,"tournament":"BFC Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":49527,"tournament_id":11498,"tournament":"BFC Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"},{"id":49528,"tournament_id":11498,"tournament":"BFC Youth Progressive #2","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-24T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"5.00"}]},{"id":11506,"name":"Mile High 3-weapon Mixed Team","start_date":"2010-04-24","end_date":"","comments":"Each team consists of 3 fencers: one foil, one epee and one saber.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Foil \r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/22\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48647,"tournament_id":11288,"tournament":"Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":20,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-04-25T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11558,"name":"Rumble Sunday","start_date":"2010-04-25","end_date":"","comments":"Both USFA and NON-USFA events will be hosted depending on number of registrations. \r\nOne touch epee will begin after last epee event.

Nadi Three-Weapon Invitational<\/b>\r\nDate: 05\/01\/2010\r\nLocation for preliminaries: Willamette University, Salem, Oregon\r\nLocation for finals: Eola Hills Wine Cellars, Rickreall, Oregon\r\n\r\nCheck-in for prelims closes at 10:00 am.  Check-in for finals closes at 6:00 pm.  Complete details with directions will be sent to confirmed entrants.\r\n\r\n<b>Prizes<\/b>\r\nThe grand prize is a hand-built matched set of sharp dueling \u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a9es (alternate prize choices may be available, depending on sponsor donations). Second- and third-place finalists will also receive nice prizes and a medal. All entrants will receive a limited edition T-shirt.  Top fundraisers will also receive prizes (see <b>Fundraising<\/b> section below for details).\r\n\r\n<b>Perks<\/b>\r\nYou'll feel like a star, with a short bio in our program, free tickets for you and a friend to the casino night, and first-class treatment like you will never get at any other fencing competition. The top four finalists will fence in front of a black-tie audience at the casino night. \r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying<\/b>\r\nThis event is open to all. There are no classification, geographic, or affiliation requirements for participation. This event is not sanctioned by either the USFA or the AFL.\r\n\r\n<b>Format & Weapons<\/b>\r\nIn keeping with the 1920s theme, the competition will use American Fencing League (AFL) three-weapon rules. Foil and sabre bouts will be judged entirely by jury (i.e. dry).  Ep\u00c3\u00a9e will be fenced electrically. \r\n\r\nThe format will be one round of pools followed by direct elimination with repechage to a final of four, and direct elimination for the finals with a fence-off for the bronze medal.  Seeding will be based upon current USFA and AFL ratings (fencers who are neither AFL nor USFA members will be seeded randomly below rated fencers).  \r\n\r\nThree-weapon bouts are fought for 8 points. The first weapon fenced is foil. When the aggregate score reaches 5 or when three minutes of fencing time have elapsed, the fencers switch to sabre and the fencing continues. If and when the aggregate score reaches 10 or when a second three minutes of fencing time have elapsed, the fencers will switch to \u00c3\u00a9p\u00c3\u00a9e. The bout will end when one fencer reaches eight points or when the third three minutes of fencing time expire. There will be a one-minute rest between periods, during which the fencer may receive coaching advice from one designated person. The fencer may not leave the strip without permission. If the score is tied at the end of the third period, USFA rules for priority and overtime will be used.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the USFA rules for non-combativity will be used. Basically, if a minute goes by without at least an attempt to score, then the director will declare that the fencers are unwilling to fight and will issue a Group I penalty to both fencers and instruct the fencers to immediately switch weapons without rest or benefit of coaching. See USFA rule t.87 for more information.\r\n\r\nFor complete rules, visit: http:\/\/www.americanfencingleague.org \r\nPlease note that the weapon order, time limits, and non-combativity rules are deviations from the AFL rules for three-weapon combined events. All fencers are strongly encouraged to become familiar with the AFL rules\u00e2\u0080\u0094especially with regard to the penalty chart, strip lengths, and right of way.\r\n\r\n<b>Equipment<\/b>\r\nAll fencers must use USFA\/AFL-compliant equipment. Foils must be standard (dry) weapons. Ep\u00c3\u00a9es must be electric. Sabres may be dry or electric. Uniforms must be white (including socks, but excluding gloves and shoes) and clean. Uniform lettering is not required, and, of course, neither are lam\u00c3\u00a9s. Body cords are required for the epee portion.\r\n\r\n<b>Registration<\/b>\r\nWe are limiting registration to 24 fencers.  Registration opens on February 18 and closes on April 16 at 11:59 p.m., with late registrations being accepted until April 30th at double fees. Fees are due at the time of registration and are not refundable.  Registrations will only be accepted through AskFred.net or by mailing a check.  If you mail your payment, your registration will not be complete until the check is received. Registrations will be accepted in the order in which payment is received.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees<\/b>\r\nEach fencer must pay a $60 fee by April 16th to complete their registration.  Due to time constraints, fencers registering after April 16th must pay a $120 fee to participate and will not receive a T-shirt or be included in the event program.\r\n\r\n<b>Fundraising<\/b>\r\nIn addition to the entry fee, we request that fencers collect donations (whether in the form of pledges, sponsorships, or donations) of any amount, which they will turn in at check-in on the day of the event.  Fencers may collect these donations from friends, family, or themselves. There is no upper limit to the amount of money a fencer may raise, but only the amount turned in will be counted (no credit will be given for unfulfilled pledges). \r\n\r\nThe fencer who raises the most donations over $200 will receive their choice of weekly lessons for two months with SCF instructor of choice OR an 8 GB iPod Nano (with video recording and FM radio with Live Pausing and built-in pedometer).  The fencer who receives the highest number of individual donations over $10 from at least 10 people will receive their choice of a 4 GB iPod shuffle OR weekly lessons for one month with SCF instructor of choice.\r\n\r\nDonations will go benefit the many programs at SCF, including support for our sliding-scale fee structure that keeps fencing affordable to everyone.\r\n\r\n<b>Location<\/b>\r\nThis event will be held in Salem, Oregon.  Fencers coming from out of town can stay at a variety of hotels.  We may also be able to arrange for a home-stay for a limited number of fencers.\r\n\r\n<b>Spectators<\/b>\r\nSpectators will be admitted free at the preliminary rounds. Spectators for the finals will need to have a ticket to our Casino Night (tickets will be available for pre-purchase from our website beginning March 29, 2010 and can also be purchased at the door). Your entry fee includes two tickets: one for you and one for a friend.\r\n\r\n<b>Officials<\/b>\r\nThe directors will be announced, and will be experienced at directing both visually and electrically judged bouts, as will the side judges. \r\n\r\nEven so, please remember the old adage of visually judged fencing: it typically takes seven clear touches to win a five-touch bout. Though you will not be judged on form, clear, well-executed actions will be easier for the judges to see. All other things being equal, the fencer with the cleaner fencing will have a competitive edge.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Willamette University","address":"900 State St.","city":"Salem","state":"OR","zip":"97301","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":44.937821,"longitude":-123.030924,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":45540,"tournament_id":10515,"tournament":"2nd Annual Aldo Nadi 3-Weapon Open","full_name":"Mixed 3-weapon (not just Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"3-weapon (not just","close_of_reg":"2010-05-01T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11541,"name":"2010 South Texas Division Summer National Qualifiers","start_date":"2010-05-01","end_date":"2010-05-02","comments":"FEES:  $20.00 per event\r\n\r\nRULES:  USFA\/ membership required and can be purchased at the door.\r\n \r\nINFO:  contact:  Oscar Barrera   Chair@SouthTexasDivision.org\r\n \r\nREGISTRATION:  ASKFRED.NET and at the door.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 004\/292010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48648,"tournament_id":11289,"tournament":"Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-05-01T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9274,"name":"NE-SD Division SUMMER NAT'L Qualifier","start_date":"2010-05-01","end_date":"","comments":"Nebraska & South Dakota members only\r\n\r\nMUST BE USFA MEMBER (COULD SIGNUP AT TOURNEY=$60)","prereg_open":"2010-02-01","prereg_close":"2010-04-29","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nCadet (U17) & Y14 Women's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) & Y14 Women's Foil\r\nCadet (U17) & Y14 Women's Saber\r\nCadet (U17) & Y14 Men's Epee\r\nCadet (U17) & Y14 Men's Foil\r\nCadet (U17) & Y14 Men's Saber\r\nDiv 2 & 3 & Veteran Women's Epee\r\nDiv 2 & 3 & Veteran Women's Foil\r\nDiv 2 & 3 & Veteran Women's Saber\r\nDiv 2 & 3 & Veteran Men's Epee\r\nDiv 2 & 3 & Veteran Men's Foil\r\nDiv 2 & 3 & Veteran Men's Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 4\/21\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 5\/8\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegistration Fee: $10 each event\r\nIf more than 3 fencers show for an event, it will be fenced.
