They will start the second week of June and last through the first week of August.  That is a nine-week class (yes, summer is short).  We haven't priced this yet but we will probably be in the range of $25 per week. \r\nThe idea of two weekday classes is that one could be for the younger or beginner fencers, the other for the older or intermediate ones.  \r\nBut we don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know which days of the week best fit your schedules.  So the purpose of this is to poll you to see what works and what doesn't.  So, if you are interested please pre-register your fencer and select the classes  which make the most sense for you.

Everyone who participates in an event will earn points for that event. The number of points earned depends on the number of participants in that event. If there are 20 participants in Youth-12 Foil, then the fencer in 1st place earns 20 points, and the fencer in 20th place earns 1 point.\r\n\r\n2. Events are mixed (boys and girls). Points will be based on overall results, not separated by gender. (All participants will receive a ribbon or certificate at each tournament.)\r\n\r\n3. Overall point standings will be based on points earned in the best 3 out of 4 Youth Progressive tournaments. Point standings will be posted at http:\/\/www.nwfencing.org\r\n\r\n4. The overall points winner of an age category in the first Youth Progressive series will be ineligible to earn points for that age category in that weapon for the second series. For example, the winner in the Youth-10 Foil category in Sept-Jan. series will not be able to earn Youth-10 Foil points for the Feb-June series, but can earn points in Youth-10 Epee or Youth-12 Foil.\r\n------------------\r\nSchedule (close of registration times & award ceremony times):\r\n\r\n9:00am Close of registration: Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n10:30am Close of registration  Y8 Foil\r\n12:30pm Awards ceremony for Y12 Foil, Y14 Epee & Y8 Foil\r\n\r\n1:00pm Close of registration: Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil\r\n2:30pm Close of registration  Y12 Epee\r\n5:00pm Awards ceremony for Y10 Foil, Y14 Foil & Y12 Epee\r\n\r\n*Current USFA membership is required for fencers born in 2001 or earlier years, and can be purchased or renewed at the door.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest Fencing Center","address":"4950 Sw Western Avenue","city":"Beaverton","state":"OR","zip":"97005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":36482,"tournament_id":8180,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #8","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-13T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36483,"tournament_id":8180,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #8","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-13T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36484,"tournament_id":8180,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #8","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-13T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36485,"tournament_id":8180,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #8","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":14,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-13T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36486,"tournament_id":8180,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #8","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-13T12:45:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":36487,"tournament_id":8180,"tournament":"Youth Progressive #8","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-13T14:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6650,"name":"BFCC - Oil Change Mixed Open","start_date":"2009-06-13","end_date":"2009-06-14","comments":"","prereg_open":"2008-08-30","prereg_close":"2009-06-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"BFC - Columbia","address":"9515 Gerwig Lane, Suite 101","city":"Columbia","state":"MD","zip":"21046","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":29948,"tournament_id":6650,"tournament":"BFCC - Oil Change Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":26,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-13T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29949,"tournament_id":6650,"tournament":"BFCC - Oil Change Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":32,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-14T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":29950,"tournament_id":6650,"tournament":"BFCC - Oil Change Mixed Open","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-14T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":6677,"name":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","start_date":"2009-06-14","end_date":"","comments":"$30 pre-registered or $45 at the door.

Directors are used to this and will not scratch your bouts if you're fencing in the other event; however, fencing in two events is your choice - please be ready to fence a few bouts in a row if need be to keep your events moving.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brooklyn Fencing Center","address":"62 4th Street","city":"Brooklyn","state":"NY","zip":"11231","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":30036,"tournament_id":6677,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y10 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y10MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-14T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":30037,"tournament_id":6677,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-14T10:30:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":30038,"tournament_id":6677,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-14T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":30039,"tournament_id":6677,"tournament":"Brooklyn Fencing June Youth Foil","full_name":"Y10 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y10WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-14T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":8725,"name":"Novice Cadet & Adult Foil","start_date":"2009-06-14","end_date":"","comments":"Fencers must be born in or before 1996.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/12\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":38338,"tournament_id":8725,"tournament":"Novice Cadet & Adult Foil","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-06-14T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":8731,"name":"RCFC Youth Season Finale 2009","start_date":"2009-06-14","end_date":"","comments":"RCFC presents our final youth tournament of the season.

The campers are welcome to stay and fence with the Atlanta Fencers who come in from 5pm \u00e2\u0080\u0093 9pm.  We will have a barbecue lunch on Wednesday and a pizza party on Friday.  Campers should bring a lunch the other days as well as daily snacks.  Sports and soft drinks, and bottled water are available for purchase. \r\n\r\n  TO REGISTER:    The camp fee is $250 for one session or $425 for both sessions.  A $125 non-refundable deposit is due with your application by June 1st for the first session and July 1st for the second session.  The balance may be paid upon your arrival to camp.  Late applications will be accepted if space is available, with a $25 late fee.  Lodging for campers is available on a first-come, first-serve basis with some of our local fencers.  Information on nearby motels can be provided upon request. \r\n\r\n   If we can be of further service, please call the club after 4pm,  or Gene on his cell, 404\/702-6204.
