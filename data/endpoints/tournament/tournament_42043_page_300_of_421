If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 7\/12\/17.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 7\/19\/17.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event.

If you have preregistered on AskFRED, but made no pre-payment by 7\/25\/17, you  will be considered a walk-on at the tournament and will pay $70 for your first event.\r\n\r\n**The registration portion of the entry fee, and any AskFRED surcharges, are non-refundable. Event fees will be refunded for an athlete who needs to withdraw and does so via e-mail to the Organizer on, or before, July 25, 2017. After this date, no portion of the entry fees will be refunded.

Plastic cards are no longer being sent to members by the USFA, so please print your card from the USFA website to present at registration. To expedite the registration process, it is HIGHLY recommended that you obtain it prior to the tournament. \r\nWe cannot guarantee use of a computer for renewal. You may renew on your smartphone or other personal device prior to presenting at registration.\r\nYou need a current USFA membership to preregister on AskFred.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n$45 Registration Fee\r\n$20 First event if pre-registered and pre-paid on AskFred.\r\n$70 First event if registering at the tournament as a walk-on.\r\nIn either case, each additional event is $20. \r\n\r\nWalk ons are to pay their registration and event fees at the bout committee\/registration table, not at the entrance to the venue, or online. Cash or check only. Spectators\/family members are to pay their entrance fee at the entrance to the venue. See below.\r\n\r\n\r\nALSO:\r\n\r\n**This is a USFA sanctioned event. \r\n\r\n**The bout committee reserves the option of combining the men's and women's veteran,or senior, events into mixed events if there are fewer than 6 competitors in one of the single-sex events. If an event becomes mixed, men and women will still medal separately. \r\n  \r\n**As per USA Fencing's decision in May of 2016, epee wires may once again legally be threaded through the channels in the socket intended for that purpose. The wires may also remain outside the channels, at the fencer's discretion. See http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/645476-change-of-application-of-the-rules-regarding-epee-wiring\r\n\r\n**USFA conductive bib rules for foil will be enforced. Rules concerning the conductive bib on the foil mask can be found in the current USFA rulebook t.471.2\r\n\r\n**Transparent masks are NOT permitted in any weapon.\r\n\r\n**Masks with exchangeable bibs are allowed. If the inspection mark is placed on the bib, be sure not to change out your inspection mark!\r\n\r\n**Anyone participating in a foil or sabre event will need 2 mask cords.\r\n\r\n**All gloves will be checked by the armorer for integrity of material. No tears or holes will be permitted\r\n(except for those that allow for the body cord).\r\n\r\n**For safety and insurance purposes, fencers and coaches must wear mask and glove while participating in drills, lessons, warm-up, with weapon in hand. Failure to comply may result in removal from the venue.\r\n\r\n**KSG charges an admission fee for spectators (anyone not competing, officiating or volunteering). Spectators include family members, and coaches, of the athletes. The following passes are available:\r\n$10 Daily Fee \r\n$15 \"Two Day Pass\"  \r\n$20 \"All Event Pass\" good throughout the tournament.\r\nFor more info on spectator

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above.
