Since the tournament takes place around the time of final exams for many fencers, this will allow time for people to plan and secure travel if their event is being fenced.\r\n \r\nIMPORTANT: USA Fencing will require a new 800N Saber glove for all sanctioned tournaments after 10\/1\/15. You will NEED to have a glove meeting this requirement, or you will not be eligible to compete in any saber events at this tournament. NO EXCEPTIONS!! More info here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/537287?referrer_id=669365\r\n\r\nENTRY & ELIGIBILITY:\r\n\r\nIndividual event times will be posted the week after late pre-registration closes. Please check back and be sure you arrive on time! It is your responsibility to check if event times change. We will make every effort to post the event times as soon as possible after pre-registration closes. There is NO registration at the event, only check-in. You MUST pre-register and pay on askFRED if you want to fence.\r\n\r\nAll close of registration (check-in) times are in Eastern Standard Time (EST). The events will typically start approx. 30 minutes after close of registration, but absolutely NO check-ins will be accepted after close of registration. NO EXCEPTIONS! Please arrive early to have your equipment checked and allow warm-up and registration time. Venue will be opened at least 1 hour prior to close of registration of first event. \r\n\r\nAll registrants pay a one-time Registration Fee of $20 + an event fee of $20 for each event entry (i.e If you pre-register for one event, you will pay a total of $40, if you pre-register for two events, you will only pay a total of $60.) The registration fee will increase by $20 after 11\/27\/15, making the late registration fee $40 + an event fee of $20 for each event entry. \r\n\r\nThe INITIAL pre-registration deadline is 11\/27\/15 at 11:59PM, and the LATE FEE pre-registration deadline is Wednesday, 12\/4\/15 at 11:59PM. Any pre-registrations after that time will NOT be accepted! NO WALK-INS! In order for your pre-registration to be valid, you MUST complete payment via askfred.net (to make payments via check, please contact chair@scfencing.org for instructions. Pre-registration will not be complete until payment is received; NO payments accepted the day of the tournament). Pre-registering for an event without payment is not considered a valid pre-registration. Pre-registration is ONLY valid once payment is received. This means that if you do not complete payment prior to the close of pre-registration on 12\/4\/15 at 11:59PM, you will NOT be allowed to fence in the event! \r\n\r\nNO EXCEPTIONS! PRE-REGISTER AND PAY EARLY!\r\n\r\nNote that askFRED validates fencers for gender, age and division. It will not allow you to pre-register for events you should not be in. If you feel you should be able to pre-register for an event and askFRED is not allowing you to do so, please verify that your profile information in askFRED is correct for gender, age and division. If you still have a problem, contact the division chair at chair@scfencing.org\r\n\r\nIf there are 3 or fewer fencers pre-registered for an event after the close of pre-registration on 12\/4\/15, the event will not be fenced, and the fencer does not need to attend the event. Those fencers will auto-qualify for the JO's in February even though they do not fence.\r\n\r\nThe Registration and event fees for unfenced events will be refunded (minus askFred fees) but only if requested in writing (email) and received by 12\/26\/15 (one week after the event). \r\n\r\nFencers MUST be a US Citizen or Permanent Resident (proof required). All fencers must have a current USFA competitive membership by close of late pre-registration. ONLY members of the SC Division of USA Fencing may compete in this qualifier. You may join or renew your membership here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced (Read more here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail chair@scfencing.org to request addition to the competition. (For instance, a fencer with Y14 points will be allowed to fence Cadet.)\r\n\r\nThis is a USA Fencing and South Carolina Division Sanctioned event; ratings will be awarded where earned. Cadet events must be rated as a C1 or greater for any classifications to be awarded.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION FORMAT:\r\n\r\nOne round of seeding pools with 100% promotion to direct elimination.\r\n\r\nUNIFORMS & EQUIPMENT:\r\n\r\nFencers are required to have complete fencing uniforms as required by USA Fencing.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 12\/16\/15. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 12\/16\/15) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>**Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2015-16 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2016, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1999-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1997-2003 and for the cadet events 2000-2003.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10021","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661685,"longitude":-73.9794009,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":121988,"tournament_id":30966,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Epee","short_name":"CdWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-20T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":121989,"tournament_id":30966,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-20T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":121990,"tournament_id":30966,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-20T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"},{"id":121991,"tournament_id":30966,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-12-20T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":30836,"name":"The Josh Fowler Memorial Fill the Stocking","start_date":"2015-12-21","end_date":"","comments":"Honoring our coach & friend, Josh Fowler, TEAM tournament open to all ages, all clubs, all weapons.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

Everyone will fence everyone else within their pool to determine first through ninth place within the pool. No direct eliminations as the plan is for a large pool. Pools will be refereed by other fencers within the pool. \r\n\r\nWhen you register for epee you are in one pool. Done. Simple. No right of way. Just like fencing epee. When you register for foil you have to choose \"Cookie Monster\" for those who think they are beasts on the fencing strip. Or \"Cream Puff\" if you are sweet and tasty.\r\n \r\nAfter each pool is finished, the fencers will take turns choosing their dozen cookies to take home or eat starting with the last place fencer and ending with the first place fencer. Cookies are chosen from within your own pool group. So hope that someone in your pool bakes great and fences great! Fencers can choose all of the same cookie on their turn or a combination of different cookies. All competitors will leave with a dozen cookies, either on a plate or in their tummies. We encourage sharing with parents, family, and friends! \r\n \r\nAs you fence, think hard about your strategy\u0081--do you want to get the last cookie?\r\n\u0081\r\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\r\nAll ages and ability levels are welcome. Both youth and adult fencers will compete in the same event. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as his or her child is still participating in the tournament. The event will be limited to the first 27 fencers who pre-register due to space and time considerations.\r\n\r\nUSFA non-competitive membership is required due to club liability insurance purposes. You do not need to be a member of MTFC, and all fencers are welcome to this event. This is a non-sanctioned event so you will not earn a rating even if you are the most awesome cookie monster. But you will take home cookies. No in-house points will be awarded for this event.\r\n \r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you can rent club gear for $10, but plan to arrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also use electric equipment.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\nMixed Cookie Monster Foil\r\nMixed Cream

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at:http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in.

It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 3 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes).

Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.
