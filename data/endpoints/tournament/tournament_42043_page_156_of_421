A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament. US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is not required as this is not a sanctioned event. This event is not rated; you cannot get a classification change from this event.\r\n \r\nEntry Fee\r\n \r\nThe basic entry fee is $5 per fencer. Electric equipment rental is $10 for the event.\r\n \r\nElectric Equipment\r\n \r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to arrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment.\r\n \r\nTournament Format\r\n \r\nWe will conduct our tournament with a round of pools and 100% promotion to direct eliminations. The rounds will be self-directed. Because this will be a mixed tournament with combined youth and adult fencers, direct elimination will be a standard 15 point, 3 period format unless either of the fencers in a direct elimination bout is 12 years old or younger in which case the format will be best 2 out of 3, 5 point bouts as is standard for all 12 and under events. \r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\n \r\nDue to space and time constraints the tournament will be limited to the first 24 fencers registered. If you cannot attend please remove your preregistration so other members of the club may participate.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"1106 South 15th Street","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","zip":"98405","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.2478708,"longitude":-122.4508783,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":78473,"tournament_id":18940,"tournament":"MTFC In-House Epee","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":20,"prereg_count":23,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-07-20T19:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":18974,"name":"FCC Summer Open - Foil & Epee!","start_date":"2012-07-21","end_date":"","comments":"Come out Saturday Jul 21st for a fun summer FCC Open!
