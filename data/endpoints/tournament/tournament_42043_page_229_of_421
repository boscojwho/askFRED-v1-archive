Choosing academia over a military career, he attended Pazmany and Eotvos universities in Hungary, where he obtained doctoral degrees in both law and Hungarian language. An able athlete, he began fencing in the 1920s. Eventually, he became a student of the legendary Italian fencing master, Italo Santelli, and earned a master's degree in fencing. Though his last national and international fencing tournaments were in the late 1940s, he continued teaching fencing.\r\nZold's professional career was actually in publishing, but with his characteristic energy he split his time between career and fencing. Elected Secretary of the Hungarian Fencing Federation, he resigned this position in 1939 in protest of the German National Socialist influence over Hungary. When war broke out, he served in the Hungarian Army until 1943. From then until the end of the war he worked as one of the few International Red Cross representatives in Eastern Europe, during which time he was an associate of Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg.\r\nAfter the war, Zold returned to publishing and fencing. When the Hungarian communists consolidated all private publishing into one government-run entity, non-communist Zold was greatly surprised to find that he had been selected to be chief of the new government publishing organization. From 1946 to 1956, he worked strenuously to run his publishing organization without running afoul of the regime. In 1948, he was a captain of the Hungarian Fencing Team at the Olympic Games in London. When the Hungarian Revolution broke out in late 1956, he defected with his wife and son, first to Austria and then to the United States.\r\nIn America, he relied on fencing to support his family, and after experiencing so much travail he sought a quiet community to start a new life. He settled in Claremont, where he began teaching at Pomona College in 1959 and USC a few years later. In his spare time, he edited works of Hungarian literature and wrote hundreds of articles for various Hungarian exile newspapers. He worked for years as a reporter for Radio Free Europe, including a stint as a commentator for the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Olympics. In addition to coaching in USC, he also coached at Claremont, San Diego State University, UCSD, Cal Poly Pomona, University of Redlands, and the L.A. Athletic Club. He was a U.S. Junior Olympic team coach seven times. Over the years, he was sent by the United States Sports Academy to be a guest coach in Saudi Arabia, Singapore, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Australia.\r\nPomona College [and the University of Southern California were] fortunate to have this world-class coach, and his students were fortunate to receive from him lessons on fencing and on life. One lesson was far more important to him than all the others: \"Never give up! Not just in fencing, but in life. Never give up!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"LionHeart Fencing Academy","address":"1331 N.

Pools for Cadet events will start, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. \r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\n<b><i>Eligibility Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be <b>current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.<\/b> To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. <i>Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!<\/i>\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\nTo fence in JUNIOR events, fencer birth year must be between 1995-2001.\r\nTo fence in CADET events, fencer birth year must be between 1998-2001.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies <b>prior<\/b> to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\n<b><i>Uniform Requirements:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nCONDUCTIVE FOIL BIBS ARE REQUIRED THIS SEASON. As of August 1st, 2012, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the conductive foil bib.\r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\n<b><i>Venue Information:<\/i><\/b>\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.
