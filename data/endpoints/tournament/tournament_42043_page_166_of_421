Points will be awarded for the top 32 competitors in each event.  Individuals who register for the San Diego Scholastic Fencing Conference will have their results tracked and tabulated for overall SDSFC individual with awards given at an end of the year banquet.  Medals are awarded at each tournament, and results tracked and tabulated for overall SDSFC individual awards given at an end of the year banquet.  The more competitions a child goes to, and the higher their finish, the more points they earn toward the big trophy at the end of the season.  At this age group, we combine foil equipment and epee rules for a friendly, fast event.  We\u0092ve found this combination is perfect for the young fencing student who wants to try their hand at a beginner-friendly tournament.  The matches are fenced with electric foils and foil body cords, but without lam\u00e9s.  This configuration produces a light on the scoring machine for a touch anywhere on the body just like epee, without the need for epee equipment.  No right-of-way rules are enforced, so every touch is rewarded with a point, and it\u0092s possible for two fencers to score at the same time.  The kids have great fun while being introduced to the USFA system of running tournaments based on pools and direct elimination. Registration fees for each individual tournament is $25.00\r\n\r\nMiddle School:\r\nGRADES 5 \u0096 8: MIXED GENDER, TEAM NCAA ROUND ROBIN FORMAT,\r\nTHREE STARTERS AND AT LEAST ONE ALTERNATE PER TEAM, USFA MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED\r\n\r\nFencers compete on teams formed around school affiliations which are club based (e.g. LionHeart Fencing Academy).   If an athlete attends a school with a team, he or she must compete for that team throughout the season.  If an athlete does not have a school team, they will be assigned to a composite team comprised of other \u0093orphans\u0094 from their club.  The season consists of a complete round robin in which all teams rotate to fence the others.  This includes the very first match of the year \u0096 when teammates fence one another.  There are no medals awarded at the meets.  Instead, at the end of the year, awards are given to the top three teams, as well as to the top three men and women in each weapon.  \r\nWhen one team meets another, there are nine 5 touch bouts.  The first team to reach five bout victories claims the team match.  All nine bouts are fenced regardless of the team match score, because the statistics for every individual are tracked for Individual awards. Most of the coaches try to fence all \u0093competition ready\u0094 kids in a match, but that is at the coach\u0092s discretion and is not always possible nor is it guaranteed.  Please realize that when a coach takes an athlete out of competition, or an athlete takes themselves out by not fencing a bout for any reason, they lose a chance at a victory which could affect both their team and individual standing.  It is possible that an athlete could place first as an individual while being on a team that finishes last, or vice versa.  Coaches with outstanding individuals may choose NOT to substitute the athlete, because doing so will jeopardize their chance at an individual medal.  Historically, the top athletes in the conference have the ability to finish the season undefeated, or with only one loss. The conference is non-profit, and charges a one-time seasonal $225.00 registration fee per team.  This fee covers the cost of facility rentals, referee fees, and awards given at the end of the year.  It does not cover the awards banquet, which will be billed separately at $10.00 per person, or $40.00 per family (your choice).   USFA membership is required, for insurance reasons.  The USFA charges $60.00 per year, and membership can be completed on the day of the first event, or online at usfencing.org.  Registration with the USFA and the seasonal conference fees are due on or before the first event.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/08\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/17\/2012.\r\n","venue":{"name":"San Diego Fencing Center","address":"1770 S.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $10 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Time<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue under the green NYAC awning.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\n<b>Subway and Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\n<b>Sanctioning and Membership<\/b>\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>Junior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2012-13 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2013, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1993-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-1999 except that a fencer born after 1999 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1994-2000 and for the cadet events 1997-2000.\r\n\r\n<b>Qualifying Events<\/b>\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.

It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  No Y12 fencers in the team event, sorry.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  If we have a lot of people signed up we may use some imagination in the format; last year, for example, we ran a pool of teams, each round to a multiple of 3 rather than 5, each round to a max of 1 minute rather than 3.  At any rate, it will be a lot of fencing but will not go on until midnight.  \r\n\r\nIt's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gulfcoastfencing.org\/GCwaiverconsent.pdf\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it's about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.
