You can find this on the Campus map found here: http:\/\/www.montana.edu\/campusmap\/\r\n\r\nThere is a slight hiccup with the location- since it is in the student's paid-membership gym, it is not possible to get into unless you have a Cat Card with a gym pass already registered to it. Which means we will have to compile a list of EVERYONE who is going to be entering that gym in behalf of fencing- including, but not limited to: fencers, parents, legal guardians, grandparents, extended family members, friends, coaches, volunteers, directors... and the list could go on. We need absolutely everyone on a list to be given to the front desk of the gym (an to probably have someone from Club with them to confirm).

However, on the day of the event, we will cull down to 8 teams.\r\n\r\nThe criteria for which 8 teams will fence will be as follows:\r\n\r\nClub teams will have priority entrance and are guaranteed a spot (i.e. if we had 9 teams, each from a different club, we would run the event with those 9 even though that pushes us over the cap of 8). Club teams will be identified by all members of the team being from the same club and the team name being the name of the club. Each club may only send one club team.\r\n\r\nAfter all club teams have been admitted we will sort the non-club teams by the strength of the team, allowing the strongest to fence.  For example, if there are two remaining spots and the remaining teams consist of AAA, ABU, DDE, and UUU, the AAA, and ABU teams will be admitted. Non-club teams may have whatever name they please and their members do not need to be from the same club.\r\n\r\nIf there is a tie for strength of team, priority will be given to the team which registered first.\r\n\r\nThere will be a hard cap on the number of club teams at 10, because the tournament software cannot run a team round robin event larger than that. If we reach this hard cap club team priority will be determined by date of preregistration.\r\n\r\nAll fencers who fence in team must also have fenced in Open.\r\n\r\nAll fencers on a club team must have represented that club at a tournament at least once this season.\r\n\r\nWe have a very exciting prize for the winners of the team event.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2013-14 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2014, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1994-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2000 except that a fencer born after 2000 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1995-2001 and for the cadet events 1998-2001.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661539,"longitude":-73.9793673,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":110578,"tournament_id":27959,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #4 Men's Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":17,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-04-19T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":28745,"name":"Nyack Fencing Academy: Foil & Epee Open","start_date":"2015-04-19","end_date":"","comments":"2 weapon open.

Event time(s) for each event will be set not later than 4\/23\/15.\r\n\r\nPlease see the USFA Athlete Handbook for qualification paths and requirements.  \r\n\r\nThere is NO walk-in registration for this tournament. USFA and Indiana Division membership required.\r\n \r\nEvents will be fenced ONLY if there are more than three competitors. The direct elimination round will be fenced to determine each place (no tie for third). If three or less fencers register for the event, and even though the event will not be fenced those eligible fencers will be considered qualified. \r\n\r\nBe advised, USFA rules allow qualification for VET events at Summer Nationals via division qualification. Qualification occurs by \"competing\" in a DIV II\/DIV III event for the weapon you would be interested in fencing for VET's at Summer Nationals. Qualification is limited to DIV II\/DIV III eligible fencers rated C and Below. Qualification for VET events is not dependent on your placement in the DIV II\/III qualifier (and is therefore automatic based solely on participation). However, any placement within the top 25% would additionally qualify you to compete in a DIV II\/DIV III event as allowed by your placement and classification. Therefore, a separate VET qualifier is not necessary, and will not be fenced. \r\n\r\nYour registration is now being reviewed to ensure it complies with the requirements for participation and qualification through this event, to include - current season USFA Membership, ability to represent the USA with proper citizenship, Indiana Division designation, and proper rating or age status for events in which you are seeking to qualify.\r\n\r\nAs the registration is now closed, but, subject to final verification, based on initial participation, the following events will not be fenced on Saturday:\r\n\r\n Women's DIV II\/III Epee\r\n Women's DIV II\/III Foil\r\n Women's DIV II\/III Sabre\r\n NO Y14 Men or Women's Foil\/Sabre\/Epee\r\n\r\nAll qualifying events that will be fenced - DIV II\/III Men's Epee, DIV  II\/III Men's Foil and DIV II\/III Men's Sabre - will be afternoon  starts approximately 30 - 45 minutes after the conclusion of their  weapon counterpart event in the Firebird Cup. \r\n\r\n Therefore, here are the approximate start times for the following events:\r\n\r\n DIV II\/III Men's Epee - 1P\r\n DIV II\/III Men's Sabre - 2P\r\n DIV II\/III Men's Foil - 3P\r\n\r\n If you are fencing in the Firebird Cup, you will already be at venue  in advance of these times so further planning is unnecessary; however,  if you are not fencing in Firebird Cup, you should plan to be at venue at least 30 minutes prior to the above posted times to allow for variations in the approximated times.\r\n\r\nIf you are a fencer in any of the qualifying events, you should ensure  that you are in compliance with the requirements of participation and  qualification as noted above.

Restaurants and micro-breweries are varied and plentiful.  The Denver Performing Arts Center, the 16th Street Mall, the Tattered Cover Bookstore, the Pepsi Center, Coors Field, the newly opened History Colorado Center, and the Denver Art Museum are all clustered in the downtown area.  In particular, the DAM is very kid friendly. REI\u0092s flagship store, with its four story climbing wall, the Downtown Aquarium, and Elitch Gardens amusement park are about 1.3 mile walks from downtown.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to range a bit further, The Denver Museum of Nature and Science is a can\u0092t miss attraction for lovers of all things dinosaur. Next door to the Museum of Nature and Science is the Denver Zoo. The new Elephant Passage exhibit recently opened.

This team will be headed by one or two coaches, chosen from all of that school district\u0092s coaches.  Normally there is a participation limit of one girls team and one boys team per school district, but this year we are waiving this rule in order to field as many teams possible.  Therefore each school district may enter as many teams and fencers as they wish for the All-State tournament.  \r\n\r\nAs an example of how we in the San Francisco High School District choose our All-State team.  We select our team members at our S.F. All-City Tournament, which is held at the end of the fencing season at an individual boys and girls event.  For the boy\u0092s team, up to an additional four boys are voted by all coaches as the All-City Team.  At the end of the All-City Meet, a boy\u0092s team and girl\u0092s team plus coaches are selected from all of our high schools to represent San Francisco in the All-State Tournament.\r\n\r\nThe All-State tournament this year will host girls and boys individual events.  We encourage each district to field any number of girls they wish in a girl\u0092s individual tournament.  The format for both the boys and girls events will be pools, followed by direct eliminations with fence-off for third, where points will be earned by the final placing.  The total points for the top three placing girls or boys from each district will be added together to determine the first place school districts in the girls and boys teams event.  \r\nThe first place team trophy for boys and the first place team trophy for girls are perpetual trophies, which have been in the school systems for years.\r\n\r\nTo enter a team, a letter requesting a seat in the All-State tournament is needed from each school district wishing to participate. \r\nThis letter is requested, along with $30.00 (to cover the costs of prizes and gym rental).  Please make out the check to Pannonia Athletic Club, and bring both to the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst place boys team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\nFirst place girls team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\n\r\nThere will also be 24 medals awarded for:\r\n\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place teams (boys and girls, 3 medals per team)\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place individual(boys and girls)\r\n\r\nNO USFA membership is required, no ratings will be awarded. \r\nAll other USFA rules and regulations apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 03\/07\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/25\/2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Halberstadt Fencers' Club","address":"621 S Van Ness Ave","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","zip":"94110","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.763187,"longitude":-122.416939,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":6,"name":"Northern California","abbrev":"NORCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":116329,"tournament_id":29495,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Women's High School Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2015-04-25T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":116330,"tournament_id":29495,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Men's High School Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"High School","close_of_reg":"2015-04-25T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29498,"name":"2015 Meadowlark Open","start_date":"2015-04-25","end_date":"","comments":"This is a North Dakota Fencing Association event, hosted by Capitol Fencing Alliance in Bismarck, ND.

These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.

Additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals. The top 8 finishers will qualify for Div IA at Summer Nationals. Any fencer who accumulates 685 points from DIV1A ROCs over the course of the season will qualify.  The qualifying path for Div1A is points based only.  If a fencer qualifies via points for Div1A and is rating eligible, they will also qualify for Div 2\/3.\r\n\r\nThe top 10% (with a minimum of 4) will qualify for Div II at Summer Nationals. Fencers who qualify for Div II and meet classification requirements for Div III will also qualify for Div III. Foreign fencers with a current FIE license can participate but foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USFA national championships, therefore, in Division 2, foreign fencers finishing within the qualifying group will be skipped and the next highest finishing eligible domestic fencers will qualify. Auto qualifiers in Division 2 will be skipped and the next highest finishing eligible fencer will qualify.\r\n\r\nThe Athlete\u0092s Handbook:(http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698380-athlete-handbook) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for summer nationals and should be used as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\nThis particular ROC is in honor of Coach Jeff Wolfe. It is with a heavy heart that we must inform everyone that Coach Wolfe has passed away. This event is now held in his memory. Jeff Wolfe, a longtime coach at Brentwood High School, fenced at New York University. After graduating he became a teacher at Brentwood High School where he began both a Boys' Team and a Girls' Team. The Girls' Team was the first girls' varsity program on Long Island. During his tenure (1971- 1998) the Girls' Team had 18 undefeated seasons, 19 League Championships and 18 Sectional Championships. The team set a N. Y. State record winning 98 consecutive dual meets. Jeff Wolfe's W-L record at Brentwood was 388-14. Eight of his fencers became collegiate All- Americans. Four represented the United States in international competition. In 1987, he was the first recipient of the NFCAA Regional Coach Of the Year Award. In 1988 he was named to coach the US Cadet Team at the Continental Cadet Championships and the World Cadet Championships. Coach Wolfe was a highly respected member of the fencing community, and is greatly missed by all those who knew him.\r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net.

Ol\u00e9! Ol\u00e9! Gauchos!\"<\/b> \r\nThis year, the UCSB Fencing team is running a fundraiser 3-weapons open. But this isn't just any three-weapon open. It is a high-stakes affair, where only the top fencers make it out of pools.  Promotion will be the greater of 50% of the total participants or eight fencers. Can you handle it?\r\n\r\nThose eliminated from the initial pool round will be automatically entered into a repechage tournament.  This second event, which is also USFA-sanctioned, will be a separate tournament, but with 100% advancing from pools to direct elimination.  Each repechage tournament will be smaller than its counterpart open, and the competition will not be as steep. But each is still a chance for glory, and an opportunity to gain valuable tournament experience against opponents of similar caliber. The repechage events are scheduled to start two hours after close of registration for the main events. Again, repechage tournaments are free with paid registration to an open of the same weapon.  \r\n\r\nThis tournament is a fundraiser in support of the UCSB Fencing Team's travel to Collegiate National Championships in Pennsylvania.  All USFA rules regarding equipment and safety will be strictly enforced.  Participants must show proof of USFA membership if they are not included in the USFA database by April 18.  Membership may be purchased at the event.\r\n\r\nWe will have prizes for winners in all events.  And yes, we checked with the National Office to confirm the legitimacy of the format.  It will be a lot of fencing!  \r\n\r\n<b>Registration<\/b>\r\nEntry Fee is 30$\/event with preregistration on FRED.\r\n50$\/event without FRED registration.\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 03\/31\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/23\/2015.\r\n\r\n<b>Events Scheduled:<\/b>\r\nMixed Foil: 10 am\r\nMixed Epee: 12 pm \r\nMixed Saber: 1 pm\r\n\r\n<b>Location and Parking<\/b>\r\nThe Ol\u00e9 Open will be held in the UCSB Recreation Center.
