Join us for two days of fun team competition!

Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nOpen events are for all fencers. The Div III event is for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing. The Y10\/Y12 event is for fencers born in 1994 or later.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate. If at least 4 all-women teams register for an event, a separate women's team competition will be held concurrently with the mixed event.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2006-2007) members of the USFA or CFF. All fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $30 per team. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=2707\r\nPreregistation closes on 10\/20\/2006\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
