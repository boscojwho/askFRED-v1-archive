again, Capital City Fencers\u0092 Club invites you to join us for the Yonas Sadek Island Cup. This year\u0092s event will take place on Sunday, November 19, at our usual competition venue, St. Andrew\u0092s Regional High School, at 880 MacKenzie Ave.  The competition is open to all fencers with a CFF license (or current USFA membership), and it will be sanctioned for domestic rankings points.  The Island Cup is not in any way associated with the Canada Winter Games qualifier.  That\u0092s just being held in the same city, in the same gym, the day before.  \r\n\r\nEntrance fees are $30 per event.\r\n\r\nWhether or not you will be able to fence in more than one event will depend on the number of fencers registered in those events.  In other words, if you want to fence more than one event, preregister in them all, and email me, and we'll discuss the feasibility.\r\n\r\nSchedule of Events:\r\n\r\nWomens Sabre\t        10:00 AM\r\nMen\u0092s Foil\t\t10:00 AM\r\nMen\u0092s Sabre \t\t11:00 AM\r\nWomen\u0092s Epee\t        11:30 AM\r\nMen\u0092s Epee\t\t1:00 PM\r\nWomen\u0092s Foil\t\t1:30 PM\r\n\r\nNote that all times listed are for the close of registration.  The actual fencing will start as soon as possible after that time.  Also note that since the first events don't start until 10:00AM, you can actually make it over on the first ferry of the day.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that the venue is St. Andrew\u0092s HIGH School, and NOT St. Andrew\u0092s Elementary, where our club holds regular practices.  Every time we hold a competition, someone ends up at the wrong school, so if you go to the wrong place, you won\u0092t have been the only person ever to make that mistake, but you will still be in the wrong place.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, feel free to email me (Sarah Smith) at sasmith@uvic.ca.  Or call me at (250) 592-8713.  A limited amount of billeting is available, but please email me, don\u0092t just assume there\u0092s space.  We may also be able to arrange rides to and from the ferries for foot passengers, but if you call my house at 9AM the morning of, I won\u0092t be there, so call ahead.","venue":{"name":"St. Andrew's Regional High School","address":"880 MacKenzie Avenue","city":"Victoria","state":"BC","zip":"","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":13152,"tournament_id":2904,"tournament":"The Yonas Sadek Island Cup","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-11-19T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":13154,"tournament_id":2904,"tournament":"The Yonas Sadek Island Cup","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-11-19T11:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":13155,"tournament_id":2904,"tournament":"The Yonas Sadek Island Cup","full_name":"Women's Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-11-19T13:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":13156,"tournament_id":2904,"tournament":"The Yonas Sadek Island Cup","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-11-19T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":13636,"tournament_id":2904,"tournament":"The Yonas Sadek Island Cup","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":2910,"name":"West-Rock Division Junior Olympic Qualifiers","start_date":"2006-11-19","end_date":"","comments":"You MUST Preregister in order to compete in the qualifiers. \r\n\r\nPlease see \"More Info\" for fees and other logisitcal info.","prereg_open":"2006-11-18","prereg_close":"2006-11-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"You MUST Preregister in order to compete in the qualifiers. \r\n\r\n\r\nAfter registering, please go to http:\/\/www.westrockdivision.org\/ and download the event entry form.

I'll put a real start time up by Nov 24, fencing will start 30 minutes after registration closes.\r\n\r\nDON'T try to sign up as a team for Random Draw Team.  It's not that sort of team event.  See the 'Random Draw' part?  We'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from Men's, Women's and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  It's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nThe Random Draw Team event will show that it is an E1 or a D1 event, or perhaps even a C2 or, God forbid, a C3, but that of course will not hold, since it's a team event.  Sorry.  You'll have to get your rating in the Men's or Women's.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gulfcoastfencing.org\/GCwaiverconsent.pdf\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it\u0092s about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.  After you cross the railroad tracks look for the college on the left.  We\u0092ll have some signs up to guide you to the gym.  Depending on where in Houston you\u0092re coming from it\u0092s about an hour drive.  \r\n\r\nMap:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/tinyurl.com\/bcfal\r\n\r\nIf you get lost call me on my cell - 979 848 7433\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brazosport College, Lake Jackson TX","address":"","city":"Lake Jackson","state":"TX","zip":"","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":29.0338575,"longitude":-95.4343859,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":12568,"tournament_id":2769,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-11-25T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":12569,"tournament_id":2769,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":16,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2006-11-25T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":13738,"tournament_id":2769,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed  Random Draw Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":" Random Draw","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":2798,"name":"Boston Fencing Club -

Fencers must show USFA Membership card or an e-mail or FAX from USFA showing confirmation of current membership in this Division or a new membership form and payment will be required (membership forms for minors require the signature of a parent or legal guardian, the coach may not sign). Receipts from clubs or other tournaments are not acceptable as these membership forms may not have been submitted. Membership forms will be available at the venue. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (bring separate checks for the tournament and membership).\r\n\r\nAll participants must have a WAIVER OF LIABILITY and CONSENT FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT FORM properly signed by a parent or guardian.\r\n\r\nParticipants are required to fence in proper fencing attire; current USFA rules will apply.

If there are only three entries, the event will not be fenced as all three entries will qualify; however, you must be at the venue.\r\n\r\nStudents taking SAT TESTS should plan on doing so at St. Marks or close to St. Marks.  \r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=2482\r\nPreregistation closes on 11\/29\/2006\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.
