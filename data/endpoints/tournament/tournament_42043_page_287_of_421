If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\nDue to the need to accurately hire referees, we are sorry, but there can be no refunds for prepayments.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228766,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":135456,"tournament_id":34274,"tournament":"Liberty Open and Y14 Saber","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-01-22T12:15:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":135457,"tournament_id":34274,"tournament":"Liberty Open and Y14 Saber","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-01-22T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":34281,"name":"ZFA Open foil; Open epee","start_date":"2017-01-22","end_date":"","comments":"Senior Open foil.\r\nSenior Open epee.\r\nEntry fee: $40 per event if preregistered thru AskFRED, walk-ins $50.

Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event.

Inside the glove there must be fixed the FIE quality label, granted after the homologation procedure, with the year of manufacture and stating 800N.\r\n  \r\nThe conductive material must be turned over into the inside of the gauntlet to a depth of at least 5 cm.  \r\nIn order to guarantee a good contact with the sleeve of the conductive jacket, it is necessary to use an elastic band, a popper button or any system which will guarantee conductivity and which has been approved by the SEMI Committee. When a conductive overlay is worn, the overlay must contain a device which fixes the position of the overlay on the arm so that its position on the arm cannot be changed during the bout.  \r\nThe conductive tissue (lam\u00e9) must satisfy the specified control conditions (cf m.28.5).\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/14\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 1\/25\/17.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2016-17 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2017, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1997-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 2000-2003 except that a fencer born after 2003 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1998-2004 and for the cadet events 2001-2004.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661551,"longitude":-73.9794078,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":139879,"tournament_id":35311,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #3 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":27,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-01-29T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":35702,"name":"Front Range Fencing Club Tournament","start_date":"2017-01-31","end_date":"","comments":"This is a fun FRFC member only tournament.

Conference Championship\r\nA. In order to fence in the GLHSFC Championships, a fencer needs to be a student at a GLHSFC high school, have competed in three Conference Meets during the season. If a fencer attends a school with a GLHSFC team, they may only represent their school team.\r\n\r\nB. The initial seeding of fencers at GLHSFC Championships is figured by averaging an individual fencer's two best finishes from the season. Fencers without three finishes from the season may not compete in the Championships. In all cases, fencers will be seeded by this formula. USFA ratings only apply as tie-breakers for students with the same GLHSFC seeding.\r\n\r\nC. Each high school team or club may enter up to four fencers in each weapon category (Mens' Foil, Womens' Foil, Mens' Epee, Womens' Epee, Mens' Sabre, Womens' Sabre).\r\n\r\nD. Conference Championships will be awarded in each weapon category (see above), and in Overall Mens' Team and Overall Womens' Team. Individuals finishing in the top eight of each competition will be recognized with trophies or medals, and will be considered All-Conference athletes.\r\n\r\nE. Team championships are calculated by adding the final placements of all fencers in the Conference Championship meet. The team with the lowest score wins. When teams enter less than four fencers in an event, they receive a score equivalent to the lowest finisher plus one for each missing fencer.\r\n\r\n=\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nWomen's EpeeWomen's Foil Women's Saber Men's Epee Men's Foil Men's Saber\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/20\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/02\/2017.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Steinbrenner Recreation Center","address":"1300 Academy Road","city":"Culver","state":"IN","zip":"46511","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.2250928,"longitude":-86.4047137,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":19,"name":"Indiana","abbrev":"IN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":143321,"tournament_id":36167,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":49,"prereg_count":51,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143322,"tournament_id":36167,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":48,"prereg_count":48,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143323,"tournament_id":36167,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Women's Saber","short_name":"WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":40,"prereg_count":43,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143324,"tournament_id":36167,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Women's Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":45,"prereg_count":49,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143325,"tournament_id":36167,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Men's Saber","short_name":"MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":56,"prereg_count":57,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":143326,"tournament_id":36167,"tournament":"Great Lakes High School Varsity Championships","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":47,"prereg_count":49,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-04T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":35930,"name":"JMU Open and Div 3","start_date":"2017-02-04","end_date":"2017-02-05","comments":"JMU's Annual Open and Div III competition.

Here is a link to a campus map: https:\/\/www.jmu.edu\/parking\/_files\/parkingmap.pdf\r\n\r\nWe suggest parking in lots: G, C9, or P. The location where we will be fencing on the map is labeled University Recreation Center. Follow the path through \"Duke Dog Alley\". It is a tunnel that will lead you to the gym. Since it is basketball season, parking in lots by the Convocation Center is off-limits. (There will be a basketball game Saturday afternoon at 4PM.) Do not park in Convo lots E and B or else you will get a ticket. But Convo lot F will be available to park in as well.\r\n\r\nEvents will be held in the MAC 3 gym at UREC.

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of four separate tournaments spread throughout the season, each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on the size of the tournament and where they finish, with the Grand Finale Tournament providing \"bonus\" points to competitors. \r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\nIn the inaugural season (2015-16) for The Music City Series, we awarded each of the Overall Series Champions (both in Foil and Epee) with the Grand Prize of a brand new Special Edition Epiphone electric guitar & guitar stand. This year's Grand Prizes haven't been announced, but we promise you won't be disappointed! \r\n\r\nMedals will be given to finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/13\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/03\/2017.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695342,"longitude":-86.6757895,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":138303,"tournament_id":34947,"tournament":"The Music City Series #3","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":31,"prereg_count":38,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-04T10:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":138305,"tournament_id":34947,"tournament":"The Music City Series #3","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":19,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-02-05T11:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":143865,"tournament_id":34947,"tournament":"The Music City Series #3","full_name":"Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":36229,"name":"Open Rapier","start_date":"2017-02-04","end_date":"","comments":"This is a makeup event from a previous tournament.
