USFA membership is required, and USFA rules apply. You must be at least 13 years of age in order to compete. Due to the size and time constraints of the tournament, entries will be capped at 30 participants. Register early to make sure that you get a spot on that great big score sheet! The top eight fencers as determined by the pool results, will receive medals.\r\n\r\nWe will fence 15 touch DE bouts to determine which fencers will earn ratings.\r\n\r\nThe Melee generally takes 7-10 hours to complete. So plan to fence all day. Bring plenty of snacks and beverages.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $20. Pre-paid is pre-registered. Late entry will be taken at door if there are slots available, a $10 late fee will be assessed.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 12:00 PM (NOON) check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

This tournament is held in honor of Ned Light, a founding coach of our club whom we lost to cancer in 2011. Ned was a varsity fencer at Duke University, founder of Triangle Fencing Club, and a huge supporter of youth fencing in North Carolina. When Mid-South opened its first location in Durham in 2008, Ned brought his club to Mid-South to help kick-start the development of a competitive youth saber program in Durham.  Many of Ned's students have earned national medals and gone on to compete on varsity collegiate teams across the country.  \r\n\r\nJeff Kallio & Jennifer Oldham\r\nMid-South Fencers' Club\r\nDurham, NC\r\ninfo@midsouthfencersclub.org\r\n(919)-286-3100\r\n\r\n***Update 3\/25\/2016: Youth 10 Women's Saber has been moved to 10:00am on Saturday. \r\n","venue":{"name":"Mid-South Fencers Club","address":"125 N.

Foil fencers must have the conductive bib.    \r\n* Seeding will be according to standard guidelines for ROC\/RYC events. It is the responsibility of the fencer to notify the Bout Committee at the time of registration if they are on the NRPS. \r\n* One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches (or 10 touches for Y10). \r\n* Initial seeding will be posted on line as soon as possible after the close of the late registration period.  Fencers should check this initial seeding periodically and email info@fenceintexas.org with any changes.  It is the fencer's responsibility to provide proof of classification or club changes AS VERIFIED BY THE USFA.\r\n* Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash. \r\n* Organizers reserve the right to limit fencing in cross-over events in order to efficiently run the tournament.\r\n<b>Seeding:<\/b> Preliminary Seeding will be based on the following order:\r\n<ul>\u0095 National Rolling Points Standing (RYC events go all the way down the NRPS, not just through the top 32)\r\n\u0095 Classification and year\r\n\u0095 If athlete has neither National

edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\nFencing Equipment:\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\nWaivers:\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian
