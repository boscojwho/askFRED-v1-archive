Being on time also allows us to run timely tournaments, something that everyone appreciates!\r\n\r\nTo check-in, please bring your CURRENT USFA membership card (downloadable and printable from the USFA website). Your membership card must show a valid date of membership for this season, i.e. cards from previous seasons will not be allowed.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, if your USFA membership card does not indicate that the birth date has been verified, you must also bring proof of the date of birth (e.g. birth certificate or passport).  There will be NO EXCEPTIONS to the proof of birth date rule.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT\r\nTo comply with the new rules on Covid-19, fencers may NOT borrow equipment from the club. Fencers must bring their own equipment, including any extras that are needed. \r\n\r\nThere will be no equipment check.  However, if your equipment is found to be faulty on the strip during a bout, you will be red-carded and your opponent awarded a point while you search for working equipment.  Therefore, please make sure that any equipment you use is in working condition - e.g. no dead spots, etc. \r\n\r\nPARKING\r\nPlease park in the lot behind the club building, or along the streets.\r\n\r\nNote that Crandall Street is a two-way street, so it is not advisable to stay in the middle of the street longer than it takes to let your fencer QUICKLY get out of the car. Police also enforce parking rules, so make sure that your car, if parked on the street, is facing the right way. \r\n\r\nPlease also note that the first spot along the curb on Crandall Street is NOT a parking spot. Please do not park or wait there, as it makes it very difficult for other cars to turn onto the street and for cars to turn out of the street.  Parking authorities will ticket you if you idle or park in this spot.\r\n\r\nIn the past, people have parked in the Taco Bell lot, but we do not assume any responsibility if you are ticketed or towed.\r\n\r\nThe parking lot across the street belongs to Riley Auto and is not open to our use.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL RULES WITH REGARD TO COVID-19\r\nFencers who register and participate in this event and persons who attend this tournament are attesting at the time of the tournament that they are not sick, do not feel sick, are not exhibiting symptoms of illness, have not been in close contact with a known positive Covid-19 person, have not traveled to any of the states on the CT state quarantine list in the past two weeks, have not been ordered by the Department of Health or their schools to self-quarantine, and are otherwise in good health. \r\n\r\nAll fencers and persons who participate and attend this tournament understand that the risk of contracting Covid-19 is increased when there is a public gathering such as this tournament and hold the tournament organizers harmless against the possibility of contracting the virus. We are not responsible for any health issues, medical care, expenses or  other issues resulting from the possible contracting of Covid-19 from a tournament such as this one.\r\n\r\nAll fencers and visitors to our facility MUST wear a close fitting face mask AT ALL TIMES, including during warm-ups and bouting. The Leon Paul mask shield does not comply with this requirement. Masks may only be taken down briefly to drink water or to take a quick breath. Any person found in violation of this rule will be asked to leave the facility immediately.\r\n\r\nThe Locker Room is closed. Please come dressed and ready to fence. Fencing bags may be stored in the waiting room.\r\n\r\nThe water fountain has been closed. Please bring your own drinks. Food is not permitted anywhere in our facility. If you must eat, please eat outside of our building.\r\n\r\nOnly one person may accompany the fencer. NO ONE except fencers and referees are allowed on the fencing floor - this includes parents and guardians. Please do not crowd the door leading to the fencing floor. It is recommended that parents\/guardians wait in their car or outside due to the risk of Covid-19 and the size of our facility. If at any time the tournament organizers feel that the facility is too crowded, parents\/guardians\/non-fencers will be asked to wait outside the building and will be expected to comply immediately with this request.\r\n\r\nUpon entry, all persons must disinfect their shoes with our shoe bath solution, disinfect their hands with hand sanitizer, and have their temperature checked.\r\n\r\nOnce a fencer has finished fencing, he\/she must leave the facility IMMEDIATELY. There will be no spectators for this event. Fencers who have been eliminated may not return to the fencing floor. \r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask Coach Alex, Coach Oleg, or Linda.","venue":{"name":"Stamford Fencing Club","address":"745 E Main ST","city":"Stamford","state":"CT","zip":"06902","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.054998,"longitude":-73.5304702,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184854,"tournament_id":47090,"tournament":"Stamford Fencing Spooktacular","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":17,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-11-01T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":184855,"tournament_id":47090,"tournament":"Stamford Fencing Spooktacular","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":13,"prereg_count":15,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-11-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47094,"name":"FAP-North Unclassified Foil x 3","start_date":"2020-11-01","end_date":"","comments":"Get the competition practice you need to improve!

Our COVID plan.\r\nhttps:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/covid\/ \r\n\r\nTo preserve the integrity of our A2 event I am insisting on payment in advance no later than Thursday November 12, 2020 or we will scratch you and give your spot to someone on the wait list. 24 hour money back, NO RISK, cancelation policy.

This is good for everyone. As such we beg your understanding and patience as we implement the following...read on. This plan complies with CDC guidelines...no one is getting sick here on my watch. htps:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/covid \r\n\r\n1) *Time change.* We moved the Men's to 10 am and the women's to 3 pm. \r\n\r\n2) We have opened the registration accepting a max of 36 fencers in hopes we can draw the minimum 25. Spread the word and help us promote to make this an A2 event.\r\n\r\n3) If we draw more than 21 fencers we will \"flight\" pools so you should be prepared for a delay either on the front or back end (approx. 1.5 to 2 hrs). Note to remain in compliance with CDC guidelines athletes NOT fencing will be asked to leave the building and return at a designated time for their pool round. We have plenty of outdoor undercover seating for you to enjoy but equally our town has many places you can go and sit and relax. Athletes will  be given time to warm up before pools and DE. Plan ahead, bring a book, school work etc.  No coaches permitted during the pool round but yes for De's.\r\n\r\n4) DE's will be an orderly process and will take place 10 minutes after the table is posted for your review.  Initially, athletes will be outside as we call in the fencers and those on deck who may enter the building with their coaches. Those on double deck will be notified and so on. \r\nCoaches will be permitted to enter with their athletes for the DE rounds. Once we are in the round of 16 everyone can stay in the building.  \r\n\r\n5) Payment is required in advance (no door payments accepted or walk in's) Zelle, Venmo or Credit Card only. 100% refund if you need to cancel, for any reason, 24 hours prior to the event. Payment links found here...  https:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/cart\r\n\r\n6) I will hire more ref's to make this go fast. If you know of any certified ref's (6 or better preferred) please send them our WAY. \r\n\r\n7) I am working on fencing time live results for you as we speak\r\n\r\n8) NEW coaches boxes will be created for coaches during the DE rounds. Yes, Coaches will be permitted during the DE's, but NOT the pool rounds.  \r\n\r\nWe can pull this off only with your support and understanding. If you're not loving this idea, bail out now, we don't need any naysayers on game day. Let's make this a day filled with positivity, good vibes and even better fencing.  \r\n\r\nCoach Mike Martin\r\nOwner\r\nhttps:\/\/wayofthesword.org by day\r\nhttp:\/\/Ridgefieldrave.com by night \r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Way of the Sword Fencing","address":"21 Governor Street","city":"Ridgefield","state":"CT","zip":"06877","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.2812523,"longitude":-73.4972894,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184290,"tournament_id":46855,"tournament":"WAY Epic Epee: Men's A2 Push & Women's Open","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-11-15T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":184291,"tournament_id":46855,"tournament":"WAY Epic Epee: Men's A2 Push & Women's Open","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":36,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-11-15T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47114,"name":"Cobra Youth Saber Sunday","start_date":"2020-11-15","end_date":"","comments":"NJ Residents only...Registration closes Friday, Nov 13...

PLEASE DO NOT PRE-REGISTER FOR THIS TOURNAMENT IF YOU ARE NOT A CONNECTICUT STATE RESIDENT, AS YOUR PRE-REGISTRATION WILL BE DELETED. WE ARE SORRY FOR ANY INCONVENIENCE AND HOPE THAT YOU WILL COME FENCE WITH US AT A FUTURE TOURNAMENT ONCE THESE RESTRICTIONS HAVE BEEN REMOVED.\r\n\r\nStamford Fencing Club will hold its second tournament of the 2020-21 season on Sunday, November 22nd! \r\n\r\nREGISTRATION\r\nPlease preregister your fencer to fence in this event. The event is open to both club and non-club members, but per USFA rules regarding Covid-19, only fencers from Region 3 may participate.\r\n\r\nIn order to comply with state and local laws with regard to Covid-19, registration is limited to 18 fencers. If you would like to participate but the maximum number of fencers has been reached, please contact the tournament organizers to be placed on a wait list. The wait list is first come, first served. If a spot opens up, we will email you to confirm your registration and you will have until the end of that working day to register. After that time, the spot will go to the next person on the list.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\nIf you preregister for this tournament, the fee will be $40.  If you do not preregister for this tournament, the fee will increase to $50 - NO EXCEPTIONS. Fees are payable by cash or check at the time of check-in. We will not accept payments by credit card, Paypal, Venmo, Zelle or via askfred.  \r\nNote that the preregistration period ends the day before the tournament, on Saturday, November 21, 2020. No preregistration entries will be allowed after 11:59PM on this date.\r\n\r\nCHECK IN\r\nPlease BE ON TIME. This means that you should arrive with enough time to get ready and check-in before the posted close of check-in. We will not hold bouts for you, as we are on a very tight schedule. Being on time also allows us to run timely tournaments, something that everyone appreciates!\r\n\r\nTo check-in, please bring your CURRENT USFA membership card (downloadable and printable from the USFA website). Your membership card must show a valid date of membership for this season, i.e. cards from previous seasons will not be allowed.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, if your USFA membership card does not indicate that the birth date has been verified, you must also bring proof of the date of birth (e.g. birth certificate or passport).  There will be NO EXCEPTIONS to the proof of birth date rule.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT\r\nTo comply with the new rules on Covid-19, fencers may NOT borrow equipment from the club. Fencers must bring their own equipment, including any extras that are needed. \r\n\r\nThere will be no equipment check.  However, if your equipment is found to be faulty on the strip during a bout, you will be red-carded and your opponent awarded a point while you search for working equipment.  Therefore, please make sure that any equipment you use is in working condition - e.g. no dead spots, etc. \r\n\r\nPARKING\r\nPlease park in the lot behind the club building, or along the streets.\r\n\r\nNote that Crandall Street is a two-way street, so it is not advisable to stay in the middle of the street longer than it takes to let your fencer QUICKLY get out of the car. Police also enforce parking rules, so make sure that your car, if parked on the street, is facing the right way. \r\n\r\nPlease also note that the first spot along the curb on Crandall Street is NOT a parking spot. Please do not park or wait there, as it makes it very difficult for other cars to turn onto the street and for cars to turn out of the street.  Parking authorities will ticket you if you idle or park in this spot.\r\n\r\nIn the past, people have parked in the Taco Bell lot, but we do not assume any responsibility if you are ticketed or towed.\r\n\r\nThe parking lot across the street belongs to Riley Auto and is not open to our use.\r\n\r\nSPECIAL RULES WITH REGARD TO COVID-19\r\nFencers who register and participate in this event and persons who attend this tournament are attesting at the time of the tournament that they are not sick, do not feel sick, are not exhibiting symptoms of illness, have not been in close contact with a known positive Covid-19 person, have not traveled to any of the states on the CT state quarantine list in the past two weeks, have not been ordered by the Department of Health or their schools to self-quarantine, and are otherwise in good health. \r\n\r\nAll fencers and persons who participate and attend this tournament understand that the risk of contracting Covid-19 is increased when there is a public gathering such as this tournament and hold the tournament organizers harmless against the possibility of contracting the virus. We are not responsible for any health issues, medical care, expenses or  other issues resulting from the possible contracting of Covid-19 from a tournament such as this one.\r\n\r\nAll fencers and visitors to our facility MUST wear a close fitting face mask AT ALL TIMES, including during warm-ups and bouting. The Leon Paul mask shield does not comply with this requirement. Masks may only be taken down briefly to drink water or to take a quick breath. Any person found in violation of this rule will be asked to leave the facility immediately.\r\n\r\nThe Locker Room is closed. Please come dressed and ready to fence. Fencing bags may be stored in the waiting room.\r\n\r\nThe water fountain has been closed. Please bring your own drinks. Food is not permitted anywhere in our facility. If you must eat, please eat outside of our building.\r\n\r\nOnly one person may accompany the fencer. NO ONE except fencers and referees are allowed on the fencing floor - this includes parents and guardians. Please do not crowd the door leading to the fencing floor. It is recommended that parents\/guardians wait in their car or outside due to the risk of Covid-19 and the size of our facility. If at any time the tournament organizers feel that the facility is too crowded, parents\/guardians\/non-fencers will be asked to wait outside the building and will be expected to comply immediately with this request.\r\n\r\nUpon entry, all persons must disinfect their shoes with our shoe bath solution, disinfect their hands with hand sanitizer, and have their temperature checked.\r\n\r\nOnce a fencer has finished fencing, he\/she must leave the facility IMMEDIATELY. There will be no spectators for this event. Fencers who have been eliminated may not return to the fencing floor. \r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\nIf you have any questions, please do not hesitate to ask Coach Alex, Coach Oleg, or Linda.","venue":{"name":"Stamford Fencing Club","address":"745 E Main ST","city":"Stamford","state":"CT","zip":"06902","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.054998,"longitude":-73.5304702,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184857,"tournament_id":47092,"tournament":"SFC Thanksgiving Challenge","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-11-22T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":184858,"tournament_id":47092,"tournament":"SFC Thanksgiving Challenge","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y1214MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":46846,"name":"Olympia FC Turkey Stab \u00f0\u009f\u00a6\u0083 Senior Open","start_date":"2020-11-22","end_date":"","comments":"Men & Women Mixed.

We're only allowing quarter capacity for most events instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when. We are taking and logging temperature.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14.
