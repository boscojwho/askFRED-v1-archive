All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome!

You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n \r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n \r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n \r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n \r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00 PM close of check-in\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM close of check-in\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n \r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n \r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n \r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n \r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n \r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:\r\n http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is permitted; however, NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply:\r\nhttps:\/\/cdn3.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/7c68-1570818\/2018-USA-Fencing-Rules.pdf?_ga=2.44686689.433513283.1547236097-1943416123.1546365588 \r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

D & Under events are for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2019-2020) competitive members of USA Fencing. Please join or renew your membership online at https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/. Foreign fencers must sign up for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale or rental. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $20 per fencer. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=44840\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/12\/2020\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":177506,"tournament_id":44840,"tournament":"2019-2020 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-06-13T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177507,"tournament_id":44840,"tournament":"2019-2020 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney","full_name":"Senior Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"SrMxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-06-14T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177508,"tournament_id":44840,"tournament":"2019-2020 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-06-14T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177509,"tournament_id":44840,"tournament":"2019-2020 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney","full_name":"Senior Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"SrMxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-06-13T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":44858,"name":"MDFC Junior Epee U","start_date":"2020-06-13","end_date":"","comments":"DATE CHANGED FROM MARCH 21 TO JUNE 13!\r\n\r\nEntry fee: $20. limited to 14 entries.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, you will not able to pre-register for FAP events for the rest of the season. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-register and cannot show up, please remove your name from the pre-registration list IN A TIMELY MANNER (more than 24 hours prior) as a courtesy to others who expect the tournament to run if it has six fencers registered the day of the event.  When you remove your name from the list the day of the event THAT IS A NO SHOW.  You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women, if there are separate events). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually. Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all FOIL fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

The pizza place near the corner is open Saturday but not Sunday, although we are a short drive to many other food options.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, you will not able to pre-register for FAP events for the rest of the season. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-register and cannot show up, please remove your name from the pre-registration list IN A TIMELY MANNER (more than 24 hours prior) as a courtesy to others who expect the tournament to run if it has six fencers registered the day of the event.  When you remove your name from the list the day of the event THAT IS A NO SHOW.  You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0975473,"longitude":-75.1451365,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":175810,"tournament_id":44465,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH  Vet  Women's Foil, Epee","full_name":"VetCombined Women's Epee","short_name":"VCmWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-06-21T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":175811,"tournament_id":44465,"tournament":"FAP-NORTH  Vet  Women's Foil, Epee","full_name":"VetCombined Women's Foil","short_name":"VCmWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-06-21T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":46259,"name":"LFA Sabre Youth Cup III: Y-8, Y10, Y12, Y14","start_date":"2020-06-21","end_date":"","comments":"LFA SABRE YOUTH CUP III USFA event. \r\n$45 if registered on askfred.net before 6\/10\/2020\r\n$60 -

We're only allowing quarter capacity for the summer camp instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2.       We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3.       We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4.       Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5.       We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks are not required during fencing activity. I have worn my mask while giving some lessons but not for bouting, and wearing it during the activity was fine. So if fencers are more comfortable wearing a mask while drilling and doing physical activity that is an option they can elect.\r\n\r\n6.       Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.  \r\n\r\n7.       We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.   We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12.   We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14. We will limit capacity in changing rooms to also maintain social distancing.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/09\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 07\/09\/2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Palasz","address":"1120 N Rolling Rd","city":"Catonsville","state":"MD","zip":"21228","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.2881568,"longitude":-76.7533178,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":183934,"tournament_id":46669,"tournament":"Friday Foil Open Bouting","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Limit 15 fencers Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"Limit 15 fencers","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":45948,"name":"Michigan Division Senior Championships","start_date":"2020-07-11","end_date":"","comments":"Michigan Division Senior Championships\r\nLimited to Michigan Fencers only.\r\n\r\nNote location.\r\nThis is the new BRFA facility!\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2019-12-24","prereg_close":"2020-06-11","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Michigan Division Senior Championships\r\nLimited to Michigan Fencers only.\r\n\r\nDivision meeting and elections will be held starting at 1 PM.\r\n\r\nNote location.\r\nThis is the new BRFA facility!\r\n\r\nAge Requirements\r\nSenior Born 2006-Ealier\r\n\r\nFencers, as always, there will be swords for 1st place and awards for highest finishing D, E and U fencers.
