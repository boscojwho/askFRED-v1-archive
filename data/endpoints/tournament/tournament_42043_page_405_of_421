Fencers must check-in each day they fence. \r\n\r\n<b>WHEN WILL I START FENCING?   <\/b>\r\nEach event consists of 2 rounds (pools and then direct elimination (DE)).  First round (pools) begin approximately 15-30 minutes after close of check-in, tournament conditions permitting.  Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.   No changes will be made after close of check-in.\r\n\r\n<b>HOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE I WILL BE FENCING?  <\/b>\r\nListen for announcements, and shortly after check-in closes pool strip assignments will be posted on-line at  https:\/\/fencingtimelive.com.

USA Fencing Rules apply (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book).\r\n\r\n<b>WHAT DO I DO AFTER MY POOL IS FINISHED?   <\/b>\r\nAfter finishing all your pool bouts the referee will show you the pool score sheet.  You must check scores for accuracy, then sign the pool sheet and thank the referee.   If there are any score errors, do not sign until the error is corrected.  Once the pool sheet with fencer signatures is submitted there will be no changes made.   Do not leave the venue.   When ALL pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.  The DE tableau will be posted and you then report to the strip(s) indicated for your event and listen for the referee to call you.  \r\n\r\nNotify the referee if you need to leave the strip area for any reason.   You are allowed 2 calls to the strip, then if not present at the 3rd and final call you will be scratched.   \r\n\r\nThe DE round continues as winners advance until the final bout.

Pool assignments are posted shortly after close of check-in at fencingtimelive.com.  \r\n\r\n<b>WHEN WILL I START FENCING?<\/b>\r\nEach event consists of 2 rounds (round robin pool and then direct elimination (DE)).  First round (pools) begins approximately 15-30 minutes after close of check-in, tournament conditions permitting.  Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.   \r\n\r\nThe number of pools is determined by the total number of fencers in the event.  Pools are combinations of 5 or 6 or 6 or 7 fencers.  You will be assigned to one pool.\r\n\r\n<b>HOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE I WILL BE FENCING?  <\/b>\r\nListen for announcements, and shortly after check-in closes pool strip assignments will be posted on-line at  https:\/\/fencingtimelive.com.

USA Fencing Rules apply (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book).\r\n\r\n<b>WHAT DO I DO AFTER MY POOL IS FINISHED?<\/b>   \r\nAfter finishing all your pool bouts the referee will show you the pool score sheet.  You must check scores for accuracy, then sign the pool sheet and thank the referee.   If there are any score errors, do not sign until the error is corrected.  Once the pool sheet with fencer signatures is submitted to the Bout Committee there will be no changes made.   Do not leave the venue.   When ALL pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.  The DE tableau will be posted and you then report to the strip(s) indicated for your event and listen for the referee to call you.  \r\n\r\nNotify the referee if you need to leave the strip area for any reason.   You are allowed 2 calls to the strip, then if not present at the 3rd and final call you will be scratched.   \r\n\r\nThe DE round continues as winners advance until the final bout.  Medals will be awarded to Top 8 finishers.   Once you are done competing you must exit the venue quickly.  If you are in the Top 8 stay for the medal ceremony.   Be sure you have all your belongings and equipment, as anything left behind at the end of the day will be thrown away.  \r\n\r\n<b>==============================================\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\/RULES\r\n==============================================<\/b>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 USA Fencing rules apply.  https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Equipment check required (mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords). 800N Saber Glove is Mandatory.

A USA Fencing membership at any level is required (for insurance purposes). \r\n\r\nThe format will be determine by how many people sign up. We could do a standard pools with direct eliminations though this is not as good for our more beginner fencers. A sharks and minnows format is better practice and more equal fencing for everyone. A round robin is great if we have just the right number of fencers (or we have a lot of crazy hard-core fencers).\r\n\r\nThe best guess right now is that the event should take 3-4 hours though if you have to leave early just let us know.\r\n\r\nWe are hoping that this will be a nice, relaxed, fun, social event for all of us with good practice and great exercise.\r\n\r\nEvent fee is $10 per fencer, billed to your MTFC account if you sign up on AskFRED (right here). Event fee is $30 per fencer billed to your MTFC account if you show up and have not signed up on AskFRED--just sign up now! If you are a rated fencer or rated referee and is chosen to referee then you will get a $10 discount to the event.\r\n\r\nWe will follow current USA Fencing COVID masking tournament rules which states that fencers can compete without face masks (but fencing masks are still required because we don't want you to poke your eyes out).

Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents in these events.

If you cannot comply do not register for this tournament. Anyone (fencer or coach) refusing to comply with safety protocols will be escorted from the venue. These protocols and tournament modifications due to COVID-19 are up for change at anytime. Please review USA Fencing's current policies on their website.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n- Only athletes, tournament staff, and coaches who hold a valid USFA Coach membership will be allowed to enter the fencing floor. Spectators must remain in designated spectator areas. \r\n\r\n- Your USFA membership card (or digital membership card) will be required of all athletes and coaches in order to gain entry to the venue and fencing floor.\r\n\r\n- No personal chairs or alternative seating options are allowed on the floor. Fencers may bring a small tripod to record their bouts or stream to an outside party but placement of the tripod may not be in any place that will cause a safety concern or hinder the running of the event. These concerns will be determined by the referees, and final discretion lies with the Bout Committee. Tripods and phones\/cameras are at your own risk. The Division, venue,  tournament, etc. will not be responsible for any broken equipment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration Fee = $10\r\nEvent Fee = $40 per event\r\n\r\nWalk-In Fees (After Nov 28th)\r\nRegistration Fee = $50\r\nEvent Fee = $120 per event\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an incomplete registrant on FRED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table. Pools for Cadet events will fence, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. *Please note that Women's epee is the one exception, during which Junior events will come first, followed by Cadet events!*\r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current \"access\" or \"competitive\" members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found in the Athlete Handbook or here: https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies BEFORE the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information is verified directly from the USFA, fencers should make sure their USFA profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\n<b>Uniform Requirements:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\n<b>Venue Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778. They can be contacted at 631-821-1131 for directions or assistance.

Ample parking can be found around the back of the shopping center, near the main entrance to Mission. \r\n\r\nMission does have a store with limited stock of fencing equipment. Please call the club for more information.\r\n\r\n<b>Event Schedule:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPlease note that event times listed are the close of registration. Fencers are required to be checked in by this time. Fencing will begin shortly after registration closes, usually within 30 minutes though the start may be immediate. It is recommended to leave yourself ample time for travel, check-in, and equipment check prior to the close of registration of your events.
