If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 7\/16\/14.

What are teams made up of?\r\n2 person teams\r\n\r\n2. What is the format?\r\nPools are 5 touch bouts with only one touch needed against the team, meaning not both teammates have to be \"out\" to score a touch.\r\nDEs are 5 touch bouts but both team members must be tagged.\r\n\r\n3. How does that work?\r\nIn pools, 2 people teams fence each other at the same time. Any fencer can hit the other team whether they are in front of them or crossed diagonally. Only one touch against any of the other team is needed. Double touches count as double touches.\r\nIn DEs, same rules apply, but only one person per team can be tagged out at a time unless its a double. If team A tags one person on Team B, then it will be a 2 vs 1 situation. The Team with both members still in will start at their back warning line and the single team member will move all the way up to start the touch. Once one team is tagged out completely, the touch is awarded and it starts over again. If there is a 1 vs 1 situation and a double touch is scored, both teams are awarded a point unless it is a la-belle situation.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please email swordsinc@yahoo.com\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Burbank Swords Studio","address":"134 S.

A former Marine, he served his country with distinction during the Korean War. After he returned home from the service in 1952, he became both a union organizer for the Congress of Industrial Organizations as well as a Certified Industrial Developer, eventually becoming the Industrial Commissioner for the town of Brookhaven.  A lifelong athlete, he initially favored boxing and competed in the Golden Gloves competition. It is said that his unique fencing technique reflected his beginnings as a pugilist. He began fencing in the 1950\u0092s, taking lessons from the legendary Maestros Julio Castello and  Giorgio Santelli. An active AFLA (the old name of the USFA) member, he competed in numerous sectional and national competitions. After moving to Long Island in the early 1960\u0092s  he was instrumental in the formation of the first fencing organization Suffolk County, the Brookhaven Fencing Association. His wife, Joan-Therese Hudson, was also a cofounder of the BFA and fenced foil on the local and national levels. Although he was a three weapon fencer, his preferred weapon was always sabre. After his death in 1996, Mr. Hudson\u0092s family has been proud to honor his memory and promote his beloved sport by sponsoring this annual tournament. \r\n\r\nThe Randy Hudson Memorial Tournament is Mission's end of camp event -Featuring fencers from Russia and some of the best the US has to offer.
