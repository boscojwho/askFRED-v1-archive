(www.middleburycourtyard.com).\r\nThe Middlebury Inn (historic inn in center of village) sometimes has lower prices than the Courtyard, and more character: www.middleburyinn.com\r\n\r\nLess upscale and also nearby are\r\nMiddlebury Sweets Motel www.middmotel.com (yes, it has its own candy store...)\r\nSugar House Motel www.sugarhousemotel.com\r\n\r\nIf you want to treat yourself to more luxury,

Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul mask or shield or similar face coverings are not permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate.\"<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF. You acknowledge you are entering this tournament at your own risk and release the USA Fencing and its sponsors, BCAF, and referees from any liability. With entry you give consent to BCAF to obtain medical care from any licensed physician, hospital or clinic for any injury or illness that may arise during activities associated with this tournament.**<\/b>\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2021-2022 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we instituted a policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\n<b>FEES:\r\n\r\n**$40 for fencers registering on AskFRED by 4\/13. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).\r\n\r\n$50 at the door for late registrations (after 4\/13) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY). <\/b> \r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 12:00 PM (NOON) check-in (closes)\r\n\r\n<b>Current valid USA Fencing membership is required.

There will be NO exceptions to COVID-19 safety protocols implemented throughout the tournament. If you cannot comply do not register for this tournament. Anyone (fencer or coach) refusing to comply with safety protocols will be escorted from the venue. These protocols and tournament modifications due to COVID-19 are up for change at anytime. \r\n\r\n<i>Entry to the venue<\/i>\r\n\r\n- Coaches and spectators MUST have completed a COVID vaccine series (Pfizer 2 shots, Moderna 2 shots, or Johnson & Johnson 1 shot) 14 days prior to arrival at the venue OR have proof of a negative COVID test no more than 72 hours prior to the tournament. \r\n\r\n- Only athletes, tournament staff, and coaches who hold a valid USFA Coach membership will be allowed to enter the fencing floor. Spectators must remain in designated spectator areas. \r\n\r\n- Your USFA membership card (or digital membership card) will be required of all athletes and coaches in order to gain entry to the venue and fencing floor.\r\n\r\n- Face masks will be required of every person in the facility regardless of role, age, or any other criteria. As per USFA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirement, face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and inserts that clip into the fencing mask and do not fully contact the athlete's face are not permitted. Masks must be worn at all times, including during competition. \r\n\r\n<i>When in the venue<\/i>\r\n\r\n- Everyone must practice social distancing.\r\n\r\n- Refrain from physical contact with other participants and attendees (handshakes, body contact, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Do not share equipment such as weapons, body cords, fencing masks, gloves or uniforms, with others.\r\n\r\n- No personal chairs or alternative seating options are allowed on the floor. Fencers may bring a small tripod to record their bouts or stream to an outside party but placement of the tripod may not be in any place that will cause a safety concern or hinder the running of the event. These concerns will be determined by the referees, and final discretion lies with the Bout Committee. Tripods and phones\/cameras are at your own risk. The Division, venue, tournament, etc. will not be responsible for any broken equipment. \r\n\r\n- No congregating or gathering in any doorways, hallways, or walkways.\r\n\r\n- When you have finished fencing in your event, please gather up your belongings quickly and leave the building immediately. You may not stay and socialize.\r\n\r\n- Top 8 to receive their medals from Bout Committee on their way out.\r\n\r\nNote: This tournament is being scheduled at the request of USA Fencing; however, subject to New York State laws and orders regarding COVID-19, including assembly of persons, or if any circumstances arise that would preclude safe running of this event, this tournament can be cancelled at any time. Should the tournament be cancelled, fees will be held as a credit for use in future Long Island Division qualifier events. \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\nRegistration Fee = $10\r\nEvent Fee = $40 per event\r\n\r\nWalk-In Fees (After April 19th)\r\nRegistration Fee = $50\r\nEvent Fee = $120 per event\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an incomplete registrant on FRED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/ Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: https:\/\/cdn4.sportngin.com\/attachments\/document\/f286-2488944\/2021-2022_Age_and_Classification_Chart_7.27.21.pdf#_ga=2.188383592.1989964843.1647997406-1742974230.1644580471\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies PRIOR to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date PRIOR to the event!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\n<b>Uniform Requirements:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords.
