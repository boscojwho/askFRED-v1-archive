If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18).

Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well.

There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall (267) 482-9597 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228767,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":156813,"tournament_id":39366,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-08T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":156814,"tournament_id":39366,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-08T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":39900,"name":"Only Sabre","start_date":"2018-04-08","end_date":"","comments":" sabre fencing all day long !","prereg_open":"2018-02-20","prereg_close":"2018-04-06","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Hat Factory","address":"1000 N.Division street, Suite 2G","city":"Peekskill","state":"NY","zip":"10566","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.3049349,"longitude":-73.9147639,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":44,"name":"Westchester-Rockland","abbrev":"WST-RCK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":158777,"tournament_id":39900,"tournament":"Only Sabre","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-08T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":158779,"tournament_id":39900,"tournament":"Only Sabre","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Saber","short_name":"VCmMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-08T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39923,"name":"2018 South Texas Div.

We intend to host one each month through Wheelchair Championships and Summer Nationals as warm-ups. We will be adjusting things as we learn how such things go, so join in and help us develop!\r\n\r\nWeapons check will be available for your peace of mind, but not required. 800 Newton Saber gloves are required for sanctioned events\r\n\r\nUtah Swords Academy hosts the Utah Fencing Foundation's wheelchair fencing program and, after separate warmups and drills, we routinely rotate all students to fence seated with our wheelchair fencers. For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs. Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated. If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get good with blade-work. Visualize every bout starting with you being backed up to the end of the strip. Try it - you'll like it! Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.   \r\n\r\nWe encourage all our fencing members to also attend and support the 14th Annual \u00ef\u00bf\u00bdWill Fence for food.\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd \r\nWe have arranged all of our events, so they do not conflict directly with this tournament.

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event (unless they are pre-qualified as described below.)\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  All fencers must be US citizens or permanent residents.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that fence in the Div II\/III event will automatically qualify for the corresponding Veteran event at Summer Nationals (regardless of finishing place.)\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule by Weapon -----\r\n\r\nMen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Sunday\r\n\r\nWomen's Foil:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Sunday\r\n\r\nMen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Sunday\r\n- Youth-14   - 12 noon Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Epee:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 10:00am Sunday\r\n\r\nMen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 12 noon Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 10:00am Saturday\r\n\r\nWomen's Saber:\r\n- Div II\/III - 10:00am Saturday\r\n- Youth-14   - 11:00am Saturday\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nEntry fee is $25 per event entered and must be paid in cash or by credit card at the door.  \r\n\r\nFollow this link to register and pay online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=39448\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\nAll events will be run as a single round of pools with 100% promoted to the direct elimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division. \r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 2004 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 2003-2006\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14. If you finished in the top 40% at a Div II ROC like Bladefest or the Battle in Seattle, you have earned Div II or Div IA Regional Points and will be qualified for Div II\/III. If you finished in the top 40% of a Div II NAC, then you are also qualified.\r\n\r\nY14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event. Y14 fencers are also qualified if they have at least 150 Y14 regional points.\r\n\r\nYou can lookup regional points on the USFA website here:\r\nhttps:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/regionalPointsList\r\n- Select \"Regional Points List 2017-2018\"\r\n- Choose the weapon and point list (DV2M = Div II men, Y14W = Y14 Women, etc.)\r\n- We are in Region 1\r\n- Click \"Allez!\"\r\n\r\nFencer with Div II Regional Points are NOT skipped when calculating the qualifiers at this event.  This means that if you have regional points (and are therefore already qualified) but fence and finish in the top 25%, you will \"take up\" a qualification slot that could otherwise go to another fencer.  So you may not want to fence at this event so as to let other people qualify.\r\n\r\n<b>As of 4\/4\/18, the following people are qualified for DV2 and\/or Y14 and DO NOT need to fence at this

USA Fencing and Indiana Division membership required.\r\n\r\nFor those events where there were three or less fencers register for the event, and even though the event will not be fenced those eligible fencers are considered qualified. \r\n\r\nThere is a $10\/event charge for events (if fenced).\r\n\r\nBe advised, USA Fencing rules allow qualification for VET events at Summer Nationals via division qualification. Qualification occurs by \"competing\" in a DIV II\/DIV III event for the weapon you would be interested in fencing for VET's at Summer Nationals. Qualification is limited to DIV II\/DIV III eligible fencers rated C and Below. Qualification for VET events is not dependent on your placement in the DIV II\/III qualifier (and is therefore automatic based solely on participation). However, any placement within the top 25% would additionally qualify you to compete in a DIV II\/DIV III event as allowed by your placement and classification. Therefore, a separate VET qualifier is not necessary, and will not be fenced. \r\n\r\nFinal results, if applicable, and ALL qualifying notices with instructions for registering for Summer Nationals with USA Fencing will be sent to qualifying fencers NLT Sunday, April, 15, 2018.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you may contact me, if by email at larry@indianafencing.org or by phone at 317-344-9088.\r\n\r\nThank you and good luck,\r\n\r\nLarry Shipp\r\n\r\nLarry Shipp\r\nChair, Indiana Division USA Fencing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Indianapolis Fencing Club","address":"7606 E 82nd Street","city":"Indianapolis","state":"IN","zip":"46256","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9057158,"longitude":-86.034252,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":19,"name":"Indiana","abbrev":"IN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":158209,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 SeniorQual Women's DIV II\/III Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158210,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 SeniorQual Men's DIV II\/III Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158211,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 SeniorQual Men's DIV II\/III Foil","short_name":"Dv2SrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158212,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 SeniorQual Men's DIV II\/III Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158213,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158215,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158216,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":158217,"tournament_id":39752,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 SeniorQual Women's DIV II\/III Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39754,"name":"Windy City RYC #9 and Cadets Epee (RYC Region 2)","start_date":"2018-04-14","end_date":"2018-04-15","comments":"Welcome to a Regional Youth Circuit tournament, hosted by Windy City Fencing in Chicago.  $30 Registration fee, plus $25 per event fenced.

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of three separate tournaments spread throughout the season (we changed this from the four tournaments held previously), each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on the size of the tournament and where they finish, with the Grand Finale Tournament providing \"bonus\" points to competitors. \r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\nIn our first two seasons, our Grand Prizes have been brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event, along with guitar strap, stand and wall mount.\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed EpeeSenior Mixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/24\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/13\/2018.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1694151,"longitude":-86.6757707,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":148467,"tournament_id":37453,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Grand Finale","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":35,"prereg_count":45,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-14T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":148468,"tournament_id":37453,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Grand Finale","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":16,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-15T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":158582,"tournament_id":37453,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Grand Finale","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":35,"prereg_count":37,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-14T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":158583,"tournament_id":37453,"tournament":"Music City Series #3: Grand Finale","full_name":"EUnder Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"E-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":17,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-15T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":40018,"name":"NE-SDakota Divisional Qualifier(Summer Nationals)","start_date":"2018-04-14","end_date":"","comments":"Nebraska - South Dakota Division QUALIFIER\r\nApril 14, 2018 (9am - 11am)\r\nSince we usually have less than 12 fencers for each event we can qualify 3 fencers.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2005-20010) and Senior (2004 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 24 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates for the 2017-2018 events:\r\nAugust 26, 2017\r\nOctober 28, 2017\r\nNovember 18, 2017\r\nJanuary 20, 2017\r\nMarch 3, 2018\r\nApril 14, 2018\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8461712,"longitude":-97.2377178,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151020,"tournament_id":38002,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-14T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151021,"tournament_id":38002,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-14T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151022,"tournament_id":38002,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-14T18:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151023,"tournament_id":38002,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #6","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":2,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-14T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":40063,"name":"NM Div Quals","start_date":"2018-04-14","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2018-03-13","prereg_close":"2018-04-08","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"***This is a Final deadline.

All fencers who wish to sign up after the close of registration will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60. All fencers who have not paid through askFRED before registration closes will be considered walk-ins, and will be charged the walk-in price of $60.\r\n\r\nPlease note that your registration is NOT considered complete until your payment has been made. If you are listed as an \u0093incomplete\u0094 registrant on FRED\u0092s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform.\r\n\r\n800N SABRE GLOVES ARE REQUIRED. As of October 1st, 2015, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the 800N Sabre Glove. Gloves will be checked at the armory prior to competition. For more information, please see the following: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/537287?referrer_id=669372-usa-fencing-news \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

Our address is 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 10:00 AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 for the event.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE DISCOUNTS (may be combined): $5 off if preregistered on AskFRED because everyone should use AskFRED, $5 off for fencers with a classification (rating) as we want to encourage our most experienced members to participate as well and be role models for our beginners, and $5 off for rated referees who will help referee during this event.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. Adults and children with all different levels of experience will be fencing together. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip if needed (we will show you if needed).\r\n\r\nYou must wear long pants and shoes with covered toes. Don't even think about fencing in shorts or flip flops. That isn't going to happen because it ain't safe.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nBeginners are welcome to use club electric equipment. Competitive fencers are expected to use their own equipement. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also borrow electric equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR FOIL\r\n\r\nThis is a sharks and minnows foil event which is not a typical USFA format but provides better opportunity for practice. We will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools as is standard for USFA tournaments. There will be a second round of pools to follow with a separate \"sharks\" group for the top fencers (after the first round of pools) who will be protected to advance to the possible direct elimination round. All the \"minnows\" will be sorted based on their first round pool performance for their second round of pools with other minnows. Direct eliminations will possibly follow based on the second round of pools from only the Sharks pool but who knows? Not everyone will advance to direct eliminations though this format will allow two rounds of pools with the second round more equal in fencing strength which is more and better fencing for everyone. Those who are eliminated after the pools are encouraged to watch the higher level fencers, ask questions, and learn some new tricks as well as enjoy the company of other MTFC fencers and families.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT FOR EPEE\r\n\r\nDepending on the size of event, the anticipated format with be standard pools, 100% promotion to direct eliminations, and a full direct elimination round.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT CHANGES\r\nTournament coordinators may change the format for either or both weapons to try to maximize fencing and fun for all participants without keeping everyone forever.\r\n\r\nREFEREEING\r\n\r\nThe rounds will be self-directed by fencers who are rated referees and claim their $5 discount.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee and Mixed Foil\r\nPreregistration opens now.\r\nPreregistration closes on 4\/13\/2018","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":159839,"tournament_id":40215,"tournament":"MTFC In House Foil and Epee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":8,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-15T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":159840,"tournament_id":40215,"tournament":"MTFC In House Foil and Epee","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":13,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-04-15T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":38168,"name":"Metro NYC Summer National Saber Qualifier","start_date":"2018-04-15","end_date":"","comments":"Doors open 30 minutes prior to close of registration for the first event.  $45\/event paid on askfred; $60 at the door without prepayment.

In this example there are 38 such fencers. 25% of that group\r\nequals 10, the number of fencers who can qualify for Division III Nationals.\r\nStarting with the first fencer after those qualified for Division II (in this example, 13th place); count off the next 10\r\nD, E, or U fencers who have not already qualified by other paths. These 10 D, E, or U fencers are qualified for\r\nDivision III. (Any C fencers in this range are skipped, but not counted against the 10, because they are not eligible\r\nto fence Division III.)\r\n\r\nWe will be selling concession items such as fruit, water, gaterade, and protein bars. There are plenty of restaurants surrounding Fairfield Fencing Academy our favorites are Garden Catering, Qudoba Mexican Grill, CT Cookie, Italian Kitchen,  Mama Mina's,  Archie Moores, and Wings over! \r\n\r\nGood luck to all fencers competing.

This is an OUTSIDE tournament (but if it is raining, fencing will be inside)! Fencing is on a well-groomed grass surface right outside the Arnold Rue Center, our main training facility (or on the great Gym floor, if rain makes us fence inside).\r\n\r\nLOCATION:\r\n\r\nPanella Park \/ Arnold Rue Community Center, 5758 Lorraine Ave, Stockton, CA 95210.\r\n\r\nAWARDS:\r\n\r\n\"Delta Blue Competition\" high-performance FIE, long-life epee for the first place in the senior event!!! (if 10 or more fencers participate). Delta Blue Standard (standard blade) for the winner of the Youth competition. Both epees feature top-quality components (long-life, well-balanced blade, titanium guard, Uhlmann socket, and FIE-approved Uhlmann screw-less point) and were proven over the years to outlast and outperform!\r\n\r\nNOTE: After two years of experience, we are fairly unhappy about the longevity of the Uhmann's FIE screwless point. The award epees will thus come with standard points, but if the winner would prefer screwless, we'll install it and ship your award epee within 48 hours at our expense. We'll also offer a free repair of the point for 12 months.\r\n\r\nPRE-REGISTRATION:\r\n\r\nPre-registration is open until Wed, Apr 11 or when the maximum number of pre-registrations has been received (each event is limited to 24 fencers). For the pre-registration to be complete, the fee payment is required. If you miss the pre-registration, and there is less then 24 pre-registered fencers, you can register late by e-mailing us at info@deltafencingcenter.com, and pay the fee (listed below) at the door.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n- Regular (by the end of the day on May 11): $40\r\n- Late (May 12-14): $60\r\n- On the spot: $90 (please check if we have space for you)\r\n\r\nWe accept tournament fees payment via AskFRED, cash, and major credit cards (sorry, no checks please). You can also pay online through PayPal - please e-mail us for the invoice. Please let us know (info@deltafencingcenter.com) if you experience any problems trying to pay the tournament fees.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT:\r\n\r\nPlease note that USFA-sanctioned events require full fencing gear, including knickers, and knee-high socks.\r\nEvery fencer needs to report to the fencing strip at the beginning of a bout with two epees and two body cords.\r\nNames on the uniforms are not required at this event.\r\nIf you are short on gear, we'll be happy to lend you our club equipment (masks, gloves, chest plates, plastrons, jackets, epees and body cords) for use at this tournament. To reserve the equipment, please let us know in person, over the phone (209 507-2633), or e-mail us (info@deltafencingcenter.com).

This tournament's events use birth year eligibility for the 2017-2018 season.\r\nIf you are not eligible by BIRTH YEAR, but have NATIONAL POINTS for the age group one younger than the event you want to enter, you are eligible to fence in that age group. For example, if you are born in 2008, you may only enter Y14 if you are on the Y12 National Points List for the same weapon.\r\nNOTE: At this time, askfred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible. If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please contact the organizers for additional registration information.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION & PAYMENT DEADLINES:\r\nPreregistration opens on 03\/04\/2018.\r\nRegular registration and online payment ends on 04\/11\/2018 at midnight, central time.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\nRegistration: $25\r\nEvent: $15\r\nLate Fee: After 4\/11\/18, an additional $50 late fee will be incurred.\r\nPayment is required to complete registration. \r\nIf a fencer misses a payment deadline they will be required to pay the next higher fee schedule. No Exceptions. \r\nChecks should be made payable to North Texas Division. If paying at the door with cash, exact change is required. No Credit\/Debit Cards.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY:  Refund requests must be made prior to midnight, 04\/11\/2018. The registration fee is not refundable. The event fee will be refunded less FRED fees and postage. No refunds will be issued for event no-shows.  Refunds will be processed within 3 weeks after the tournament. The NTX Division follows the refund policy of the USFA. \r\n\r\nIf a fencer meets the classification requirement when his or her application is processed by the Division, and subsequently earns a higher classification, the fencer retains eligibility for that tournament.\r\n\r\nFENCE OFF FOR THIRD: If there are more than three fencers, but fewer than 13, third place must be fenced. Where there are 13 or more fencers in the final results, third place does not have to be fenced.\r\n\r\nWe will not fence an event if 3 or fewer fencers are signed up as all three will qualify. Fencers will be listed as DNF (did not fence). \r\nPer USFA guidelines, to qualify you must still pay registration and event fees and be present at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: Event format is one round of qualifying pools and 100% to direct eliminations. Initial seeding will be by classification and year, then randomly.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT GUIDELINES:\r\nStandard fencing uniforms without any rips, tears, or holes are required. Warm-up pants are not allowed. Names on uniforms are not required.\r\nFencing glove must cover half of the forearm. \r\nStandard fencing plastron (underarm protector) is required; women must wear chest protector.\r\nMask must pass a 12K punch test. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\nCords, lames, and masks are subject to standard electrical resistance checks. At least two working body cords, mask cords, and weapons are required.\r\n\r\nUSFA Membership\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. Proof of membership is required. Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using most current USFA membership data. Fencers\/Parents, please ensure YOUR email and not your coach's email is in the Askfred database. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\nThanks for using FRED!

If you are listed as an \u0093incomplete\u0094 registrant on FRED\u0092s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table.\r\n\r\nWhile fencers may fence in more than one event on this day, they should realize that they do so at their own risk. Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! Be sure to encourage your teammates, clubmates, and friends to fence!\r\n\r\nLive tournament seedings and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results\r\n\r\nEligibility Information:\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698114-membership Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships and High School Competitive memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 2-9 of the Athlete Handbook or here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698393-age-and-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nFencers competing in Div 2\/3 events must follow the rating restrictions set forth by the USFA. Only fencers with a rating of C or lower are eligible to fence at these qualifiers.\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information comes directly from askFRED, fencers should make sure their FRED profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\nIf you are an auto-qualifier and will be fencing anyway, please be sure to notify the Bout Committee of your status.\r\n\r\nUniform Requirements:\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform.\r\n\r\n800N SABRE GLOVES ARE REQUIRED THIS SEASON. As of October 1st, 2015, all tournaments nationwide will be required to use the 800N Sabre Glove. Gloves will be checked at the armory prior to competition. For more information, please see the following: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/news_article\/show\/537287?referrer_id=669372-usa-fencing-news \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\nVenue Information:\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778. They can be contacted at 631-821-1131 for directions or assistance. A map can be found at http:\/\/bit.ly\/mfcmap Mission is in the same shopping center as Kohl\u0092s, Michael\u0092s, and PETCO.

Ample parking can be found around the back of the shopping center, near the main entrance to Mission.\r\n\r\nMission does have a store with limited stock of fencing equipment. Please call the club for more information.\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nPlease note that event times listed are the close of registration. Fencers are required to be checked in by this time.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n**Mailing Address for All Locations**\r\n- P.O.
