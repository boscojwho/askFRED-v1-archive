This tournament is open to all members of the Georgia Division, and the winner of each event will be recognized as the Division Champion for the past season.  In addition, this will be the final meet to earn points for the GA Division point standings, and the point standing winners will also be recognized after the completion of their events.\r\n\r\n  In addition, there will be a team event in each weapon. Each USFA \u0096 member club may submit one team entry per weapon, 3 persons plus an optional alternate.  The teams may be mixed in gender, but all competitors must officially represent that club.\r\n\r\n  This event is not a qualifier, but will serve to give you \u0093bragging rights\u0094 for the season, and will be a good preparation for those going to Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\n  Entry fees: $20 per individual event, and $30 per team (not team member) for team events.
