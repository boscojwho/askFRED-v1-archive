Winners usually can win small prizes.  For the last few Saturdays, winners were awarded Allstar-Uhlmann tournament socks.  While waiting for their turn, kids are encouraged to sit in the same general area, socialize, and have fun!\r\n\r\nOnce this event gets big enough, larger prizes will be awarded.  And, winners' names will be published in the Patch, the Star-Ledger, and other publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Background Information.<\/b>  With the increased number of fencing clubs these days, young fencers have found some difficulty finding similarly aged or skilled opponents at their clubs.  COVID has made this worse as some classes have gone from 20 kids to 4.  Many fencers have turned to tournaments to overcome these shortcomings but they have some drawbacks.  Fencers wait long times to fence with only a limited number of bouts.  They can also be overly competitive and stressful.  The costs can also be prohibitive.\r\n\r\nThis weekly fencing event attempts to remedy this.  It brings kids from all over NJ and NY to come together and just fence for fun.  It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter what club you are affiliated with as it is open to all.\r\n\r\nMany fencing coaches have expressed concern that this is an attempt to poach their students.  This is not the case.  To let you know, I am a father who is simply creating a venue for his 2 middle-school children to have fun fencing.  I am not affiliated with NJFA or any other club.  I don't get paid for this as the $5 daily fee directly goes to NJFA for facility usage.  I firmly believe that private lessons at your fencing club are essential for becoming a good fencer so please do not quit your club, thinking this event is sufficient for your growth!\r\n\r\nThis event also will not derail your coach's technique.  If this was true, then official tournaments would be harmful as well.  The more you practice, the better you become.  The more varied opponents you practice against, the more experience you gain.  This is what this weekly meet aims to accomplish in an enjoyable atmosphere.  Instead of fencing the same practice partners at your local club, you get to fence kids from all over the NY metro area.  You'll get to meet people with many different styles and various levels of skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cost.<\/b>  $5 per visit (which is really cheap!).  The first time is free so you can try it out.  Venmo, Zelle, or other alternative payment options are available.  (My Venmo is @EdwinKim777.)  If you would like to donate, please do so.  I'll put the extra money into bigger prizes!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Help Wanted.<\/b>  I would love any help regarding this activity.  If you would like to officiate bouts or help oversee things, please let me know.  When I fenced in high school, Masters was the largest and the most successful club.  It succeeded because the kids had a lot of fun.  This made them want to come more often, which in turn made them better fencers.  Help me replicate that same environment here.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested or have additional questions, please feel free to email me at edwinkim777@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEddie","venue":{"name":"NJFA","address":"","city":"Maplewood","state":"NJ","zip":"07040","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7312956,"longitude":-74.2707509,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":186529,"tournament_id":47796,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good Are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":186530,"tournament_id":47796,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good Are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":186531,"tournament_id":47796,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good Are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":48827,"name":"AIC Competing For The Next Level -Y3","start_date":"2021-11-20","end_date":"","comments":"AIC Competing For The Next Level events.

Signage will be posted by the\r\n entrances to make sure that people can find it. If you\r\narrive at the facility and cannot find the venue, either ask the\r\nstaff in the lobby or call me at (347)296-9463. The next important\r\nupdate is parking. Several participants in our summer tournament were\r\nticketed, something that has not happened previously. I spoke to\r\nparking and transportation services regarding the matter. While they\r\nactively ticket from 7:30-5:30 during the weekdays, USF has a policy\r\nthat appropriate parking passes are required 24\/7. As a result if they\r\nrandomly decide to ticket for parking passes over the weekend they are well within\r\ntheir rights to issue a parking citation. A daily visitor parking pass\r\ncan be purchased from the first link attached below. I was told they\r\ncost around $5. If you park without a daily visitor parking pass\r\nand\/or in a parking lot which is not marked for D passes then you do\r\nso at your own risk. \r\n\r\nEmail fencingclubatusf@gmail.com with any questions or text (347)296-9463\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usf.edu\/administrative-services\/parking\/permits\/visitor-daily-permits.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n12301 USF Maple Drive, Tampa, FL - Campus Rec Center\r\n\r\nDirections: Take the Fowler Ave Exit (#265) on I-75, heading West.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Anyone (fencer or coach) refusing to comply with safety protocols will be escorted from the venue. These protocols and tournament modifications due to COVID-19 are up for change at anytime. \r\n\r\n<i>Entry to the venue<\/i>\r\n\r\n- One spectator will be allowed per athlete. This spectator MUST have completed a COVID vaccine series (Pfizer 2 shots, Moderna 2 shots, or Johnson & Johnson 1 shot) 14 days prior to arrival at the venue OR have proof of a negative COVID test no more than 72 hours prior to the tournament. \r\n\r\n- Coaches MUST have completed a COVID vaccine series (Pfizer 2 shots, Moderna 2 shots, or Johnson & Johnson 1 shot) 14 days prior to arrival at the venue OR have proof of a negative COVID test no more than 72 hours prior to the tournament. \r\n\r\n- Only athletes, tournament staff, and coaches who hold a valid USFA Coach membership will be allowed to enter the fencing floor.

As per USFA\u00e2\u0080\u0099s requirement, face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and inserts that clip into the fencing mask and do not fully contact the athlete's face are not permitted.\r\n\r\n<i>When in the venue<\/i>\r\n\r\n- Everyone must practice social distancing.\r\n\r\n- Refrain from physical contact with other participants and attendees (handshakes, body contact, etc.)\r\n\r\n- Do not share equipment such as weapons, body cords, fencing masks, gloves or uniforms, with others.\r\n\r\n- No personal chairs or alternative seating options are allowed on the floor. Fencers may bring a small tripod to record their bouts or stream to an outside party but placement of the tripod may not be in any place that will cause a safety concern or hinder the running of the event. These concerns will be determined by the referees, and final discretion lies with the Bout Committee. Tripods and phones\/cameras are at your own risk. The Division, venue,  tournament, etc. will not be responsible for any broken equipment. \r\n\r\n- No congregating or gathering in any doorways, hallways, or walkways.\r\n\r\n- When you have finished fencing in your event, please gather up your belongings quickly and leave the building immediately.

If you are listed as an incomplete registrant on FRED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table. Pools for Cadet events will fence, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. *Please note that Women's epee is the one exception, during which Junior events will come first, followed by Cadet events!*\r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member. If you do not have a membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up for one on the day of the tournament. One-day memberships are not valid for qualification events. Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 22 of the Athlete Handbook or here: https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies BEFORE the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information is verified directly from the USFA, fencers should make sure their USFA profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\n<b>Uniform Requirements:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked, and directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing.\r\n\r\n<b>Venue Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nMission Fencing Center is located at 346 Route 25A, Rocky Point, NY 11778.

Scan USA Fencing membership card with barcode at the contactless self-check-in station. Print membership card or download to your phone on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership.  If you wish to take advantage of the age verification process, see the staff member at check-in and provide a copy of passport, birth certificate or other government-issued identification; this is not mandatory.  \r\n\r\nEnter venue and proceed to equipment check.    Armorers will test foil and saber lame, masks, glove, 2 body cords, 2 saber mask cords, saber cuff.   Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot approved for use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Have your lame right side out and zipped up.   Untangle and straighten body cords and mask cords, and remove any tape from previous tournaments.  \r\n\r\nAfter checking in, verify your seeding information at fencingtimelive.com and report any discrepancies to the Bout Committee (BC) before close of check-in time for your event.   No changes will be made after check-in closes.\r\n\r\nAfter equipment check find a location for your fencing bag (do not block doors, aisles, walking areas, or fire exits).  Tentative Pod assignments will be posted noting the location of your pool round, so you can place your fencing bag near your pool location.    Final pool strip assignments cannot be posted until close of check-in.  \r\n\r\nCHECK-IN\r\nAll times are close of check-in. We strongly encourage you to arrive at the venue at least 1 hour before close of your event registration. Venue opens at 6:30 a.m. Fencers failing to check-in by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be issued.  Fencers must check-in each day they fence. \r\n\r\nWHEN WILL I START FENCING?   \r\nEach event consists of 2 rounds (pools and then direct elimination (DE)).  First round (pools) begin approximately 15-30 minutes after close of check-in, tournament conditions permitting.  Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.   No changes will be made after close of check-in.\r\n\r\nHOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE I WILL BE FENCING?  \r\nListen for announcements, and shortly after check-in closes pool strip assignments will be posted on-line at  https:\/\/fencingtimelive.com. There is no wi-fi in the venue; internet access is through your cell phone or other provider.   Take spare weapons and body cords with you when reporting to the strip for your bouts.  USA Fencing Rules apply (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book).\r\n\r\nWHAT DO I DO AFTER MY POOL IS FINISHED?   \r\nAfter finishing all your pool bouts the referee will show you the pool score sheet.  You must check scores for accuracy, then sign the pool sheet and thank the referee.   If there are any score errors, do not sign until the error is corrected.  Once the pool sheet with fencer signatures is submitted there will be no changes made.   Do not leave the venue.   When ALL pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.  The DE tableau will be posted and you then report to the strip(s) indicated for your event and listen for the referee to call you.  \r\n\r\nNotify the referee if you need to leave the strip area for any reason.   You are allowed 2 calls to the strip, then if not present at the 3rd and final call you will be scratched.   \r\n\r\nThe DE round continues as winners advance until the final bout.  Medals will be awarded to Top 8 finishers.   Once you are done competing you must exit the venue quickly.  Medals can be picked up in the lobby.

There are also numerous restaurants near the venue.  You are encouraged to bring your own water; there may be no public water stations available and water may only be available by purchase from the venue.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>NEARBY HOTELS<\/b>\r\n\r\nHyatt Place: http:\/\/www.hyatt.com\/hyatt\/index.jsp  \r\n\r\nCourtyard by Marriott: http:\/\/www.marriott.com\/hotels\/travel\/ewrse-courtyard-secaucus-meadowlands\r\n\r\nSix national hotel chains are within a 5 minute drive: Crowne Plaza Hotel, LaQuinta Inn & Suites, Meadowlands Plaza Hotel, Hilton Garden Inn, Hilton Meadowlands, Candlewood Suites  \r\n\r\n<b>=================================================================================================================================================== <\/b>\r\n\r\n<i>WHERE SHOULD I GO FIRST?<\/i>\r\n\r\nCheck in:  Scan USA Fencing membership card with barcode at the contactless self-check-in station. Print membership card on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership.  If you wish to take advantage of the age verification process, see the staff member at check-in and provide a copy of passport, birth certificate or other government-issued identification.  \r\n\r\nProceed to equipment check at the armory.   Armorers will test foil and saber lame, masks, gloves, 2 body cords, 2 saber mask cords, saber cuff.   Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot approved for use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Have your lame right side out and zipped up.   Untangle and straighten body cords and mask cords, and remove any tape from previous tournaments.  \r\n\r\nAfter checking in, verify your seeding information at fencingtimelive.com and report any discrepancies to the Bout Committee (BC) before close of check-in time for your event.   No changes will be made after check-in closes.\r\n\r\nAfter equipment check find a location for your fencing bag (do not block doors, aisles, walking areas, or fire exits).  Tentative Pod assignments will be posted noting the location of your pool round, so you can place your fencing bag near your pool location.    Final pool strip assignments cannot be posted until close of check-in.  \r\n\r\n<i>CHECK-IN<\/i>\r\nAll times are close of check-in. We strongly encourage you to arrive at the venue at least 1 hour before close of your event registration. Venue opens at 6:30 a.m. Fencers failing to check-in by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be issued.  Fencers must check-in each day they fence. \r\n\r\n<i>WHEN WILL I START FENCING?<\/i>\r\nEach event consists of 2 rounds (pools and then direct elimination (DE)).  First round (pools) begins approximately 15-30 minutes after close of check-in, tournament conditions permitting.  Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.   \r\n\r\n<i>HOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE I WILL BE FENCING?  <\/i>\r\nListen for announcements, and shortly after check-in closes pool strip assignments will be posted on-line at  https:\/\/fencingtimelive.com. There is no wi-fi in the venue; internet access is through your cell phone or other provider.   Take spare weapons and body cords with you when reporting to the strip for your bouts.  USA Fencing Rules apply (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book).\r\n\r\n<i>WHAT DO I DO AFTER MY POOL IS FINISHED?   <\/i>\r\nAfter finishing all your pool bouts the referee will show you the pool score sheet.  You must check scores for accuracy, then sign the pool sheet and thank the referee.   If there are any score errors, do not sign until the error is corrected.  Once the pool sheet with fencer signatures is submitted to the Bout Committee there will be no changes made.   Do not leave the venue.   When ALL pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.  The DE tableau will be posted and you then report to the strip(s) indicated for your event and listen for the referee to call you.  \r\n\r\nNotify the referee if you need to leave the strip area for any reason.   You are allowed 2 calls to the strip, then if not present at the 3rd and final call you will be scratched.   \r\n\r\nThe DE round continues as winners advance until the final bout.  Medals will be awarded to Top 8 finishers.   Once you are done competing you must exit the venue quickly.  Medals can be picked up in the lobby. Be sure you have all your belongings and equipment, as anything left behind at the end of the day will be thrown away.  \r\n\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\/RULES\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 USA Fencing rules apply.  https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Equipment check required (mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, gloves, head cords, and body cords). 800N Saber Glove is Mandatory.

Sorry. \r\n\r\n* We'll clean the gym, have hand sanitizer available, and will only have bottled water as concessions. Bring your own food, it should be a nice day and you're welcome to sit outside to have a snack. \r\n\r\n* Surgical or cloth masks are required for everyone in the gym, including competing athletes, per the USFA guidelines above: \r\n\r\n<i>\"All persons must wear surgical or cloth masks covering the nose and mouth while present in the venue, including athletes while they are competing.\"<\/i>\r\n\r\nBandanas, gaiters, and other similar items are not masks and don't count.

It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  No Y12 fencers in the team event, sorry.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  If we have a lot of people signed up we may use some imagination in the format; last year, for example, we ran a pool of teams, each round to a multiple of 3 rather than 5, each round to a max of 1 minute rather than 3.  At any rate, it will be a lot of fencing but will not go on until midnight.  \r\n\r\nIt's fun!  Come out and fence!\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  Masks, gloves, and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Committee\/Downloads\/fileDL.php?file_id=56\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.

Winners usually can win small prizes.  For the last few Saturdays, winners were awarded Allstar-Uhlmann tournament socks.  While waiting for their turn, kids are encouraged to sit in the same general area, socialize, and have fun!\r\n\r\nOnce this event gets big enough, larger prizes will be awarded.  And, winners' names will be published in the Patch, the Star-Ledger, and other publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Background Information.<\/b>  With the increased number of fencing clubs these days, young fencers have found some difficulty finding similarly aged or skilled opponents at their clubs.  COVID has made this worse as some classes have gone from 20 kids to 4.  Many fencers have turned to tournaments to overcome these shortcomings but they have some drawbacks.  Fencers wait long times to fence with only a limited number of bouts.  They can also be overly competitive and stressful.  The costs can also be prohibitive.\r\n\r\nThis weekly fencing event attempts to remedy this.  It brings kids from all over NJ and NY to come together and just fence for fun.  It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t matter what club you are affiliated with as it is open to all.\r\n\r\nMany fencing coaches have expressed concern that this is an attempt to poach their students.  This is not the case.  To let you know, I am a father who is simply creating a venue for his 2 middle-school children to have fun fencing.  I am not affiliated with NJFA or any other club.  I don't get paid for this as the $5 daily fee directly goes to NJFA for facility usage.  I firmly believe that private lessons at your fencing club are essential for becoming a good fencer so please do not quit your club, thinking this event is sufficient for your growth!\r\n\r\nThis event also will not derail your coach's technique.  If this was true, then official tournaments would be harmful as well.  The more you practice, the better you become.  The more varied opponents you practice against, the more experience you gain.  This is what this weekly meet aims to accomplish in an enjoyable atmosphere.  Instead of fencing the same practice partners at your local club, you get to fence kids from all over the NY metro area.  You'll get to meet people with many different styles and various levels of skill.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Cost.<\/b>  $5 per visit (which is really cheap!).  The first time is free so you can try it out.  Venmo, Zelle, or other alternative payment options are available.  (My Venmo is @EdwinKim777.)  If you would like to donate, please do so.  I'll put the extra money into bigger prizes!\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Help Wanted.<\/b>  I would love any help regarding this activity.  If you would like to officiate bouts or help oversee things, please let me know.  When I fenced in high school, Masters was the largest and the most successful club.  It succeeded because the kids had a lot of fun.  This made them want to come more often, which in turn made them better fencers.  Help me replicate that same environment here.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested or have additional questions, please feel free to email me at edwinkim777@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nEddie","venue":{"name":"NJFA","address":"","city":"Maplewood","state":"NJ","zip":"07040","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7312956,"longitude":-74.2707509,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":186391,"tournament_id":47760,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":186392,"tournament_id":47760,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":186393,"tournament_id":47760,"tournament":"Middle School & High School - How Good are You?","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":49297,"name":"Work Off the Turkey","start_date":"2021-11-27","end_date":"","comments":"Please join us for this post Thanksgiving Turkey roast (no turkeys will be harmed)!!

Open only to fencers whose current USFA membership is in Philadelphia Division.  If you are registered in another Division, you are not eligible, even if your home address is in the Division.  Please check your membership card before registering.  \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT NOTE FOR MEN'S EPEEISTS AND WOMEN'S FOILISTS:  DUE TO FAP-N CLASSES YOU WILL NOT BE PERMITTED ENTRY TO THE SALLE PRIOR TO 2:00 PM.

If such a fencer elects to withdraw from the Cadet tournament, the Cadet registration fees will be refunded. (FRED fees are not refundable).\r\n\r\nRegular fees: $25 registration, $25 per weapon.  Regular fee deadline Nov 22.\r\nDouble fees: $50 registration, $50 per weapon.  Double fee period to Nov 29. No registration accepted after Nov 29; no walk-ins accepted at door.\r\n\r\nFees determined by the day you pay, not the day you sign up on FRED.  Only registrations paid in full are considered complete.  Signing up on FRED with no payment makes you a pending registrant, not officially registered.  To pay by check or for questions about payment, contact Jeanne Gallagher, jgallagher2616@gmail.com or telephone 610-789-2616 (voice only, no text).\r\n\r\nAll fencers must present proof of Covid 19 status and current USFA\/Philadelphia Division membership at check-in (membership card printed out or stored as a picture on your phone).  Fencers whose date of birth is not verified (see your membership card) may bring proof of age (birth certificate, driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license, passport) to check-in, and that information will be forwarded to the National Office.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must have the necessary equipment to conform with USFA rules and in good condition.  Equipment will not be supplied by the host venue or Division.  Chest protectors used by foil fencers must be covered in soft material and must be worn below the plastron.  All sabre gloves must meet the 800 NM standard.  \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 NOTICE: \r\nAll USFA health and safety rules will be enforced.  All persons in the venue, including fencers, coaches, referees, and tournament officials must wear a suitable mask, covering the mouth and nose at all times, including while on-strip.  Yelling or screaming at any time is prohibited (Group 1 penalty).  Continued failure to comply with any of these requirements is a Group 3 penalty, which may result in exclusion from the competition.  Fencers must sanitize reels and other equipment after use; disinfectant wipes will be provided.\r\n\r\nFencers, coaches, and officials should not enter the venue if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms of respiratory infection; if they have had a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding 10 day; or if they have been in close contact with a person who was positive for COVID-19 in the preceding 10 days.  A temperature check may also be conducted at the door.  Fencers who are prevented from competing in the various qualifying events due to COVID-19 restrictions will be able to petition for entry to the Junior Olympics.  Petitions are handled by the National Office, not the Division.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons in the venue will be restricted.  Only fencers, referees, and tournament officials will be permitted entry.  If space permits, one coach per club will be allowed in the venue.  Parents and other spectators will not be allowed in the venue.\r\n\r\nBy attending this tournament, you agree that within 14 days of the date of the event, you have not tested positive for COVID-19, been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, or traveled to a known COVID-19 hotspot. Additionally, you release and hold harmless US Fencing, USFA Philadelphia Division, Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Inc. and tournament staff from any and all liability regarding COVID-19 transmission. While state and local regulations will be followed to the letter and every other reasonable precaution will be taken, there is an inherent transmission risk associated with being in any public place.\r\n\r\nDressing rooms are closed. Fencers must arrive properly dressed, or in appropriate attire to permit dressing in the main fencing area. Fencers must change shoes when arriving at the venue; do not come in from outside already wearing your fencing shoes. Rest rooms will be available, but may not be used as dressing rooms.\r\n\r\nPlease use the entrance on Rices Mill Road. Check-in will be held in that lobby.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Ave","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0975354,"longitude":-75.1451207,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":191701,"tournament_id":49201,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022  Junior Olympics Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-03T18:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191702,"tournament_id":49201,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022  Junior Olympics Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-04T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191703,"tournament_id":49201,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022  Junior Olympics Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Women's Saber","short_name":"JrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-04T16:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191704,"tournament_id":49201,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022  Junior Olympics Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-04T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191705,"tournament_id":49201,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022  Junior Olympics Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-03T18:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191706,"tournament_id":49201,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022  Junior Olympics Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Men's Saber","short_name":"JrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-04T16:00:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"}]},{"id":48969,"name":"Manchen Friday Night \"U\" Foil","start_date":"2021-12-03","end_date":"","comments":"Unrated Foil starts at 6:15 pm.

Please review the information at https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/news_article\/show\/1151513 carefully.  If you have questions about qualifying paths or are unsure about whether you have already qualified through national or regional points, please contact the National Office.  \r\n\r\nThese are the Philadelphia Division qualifying events for Cadets (birth years 2005-2008) for the Junior Olympic championships, to be held in  Salt Lake City in February 2022.  Open only to fencers whose valid USFA membership is in Philadelphia Division.  If you are registered in another Division, you are not eligible, even if your home address is in the PHL Division.  Please check your membership card before registering.  \r\n\r\nThe top 25% of competitors (rounded up, minimum of 3 qualifiers in each event) will qualify in their respective weapon.  Fencers of Cadet age (birth years 2005-08) who qualify the previous day at the Junior Qualifying tournament  \r\nand elect to withdraw from the Cadet tournament, will have  Cadet registration fees refunded by Division (FRED fees are not refundable).\r\n\r\nRegular fees: $25 registration, $25 per weapon.  Regular fee deadline Nov 22\r\nDouble fees: $50 registration, $50 per weapon.  Double fee period to Nov 29. No registration accepted after Nov 29; no walk-ins accepted at door.\r\n\r\nFees determined by the day you pay, not the day you sign up on FRED.  Only registrations paid in full are considered complete.  Signing up via FRED with no payment makes you a pending registrant, and not officially registered.  To pay by check or for questions about payment, contact Jeanne Gallagher, jgallagher2616@gmail.com or telephone 610-789-2616 (voice only, no text).\r\n\r\nAll fencers must present proof of Covid 19 status and proof of current USFA\/Philadelphia Division membership at check-in (membership card printed out or stored as a picture on your phone).  Fencers whose date of birth is not verified (see your membership card) may bring proof of age (birth certificate, driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license, passport) to check-in, and that information will be forwarded to the National Office.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must have the necessary equipment to conform with USFA rules and in good condition.  Equipment will not be supplied by the host or the Division.  Chest protectors used by foil fencers must be covered in soft material and must be worn below the plastron.  All sabre gloves must meet the 800 NM standard.  \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 NOTICE: \r\nAll USFA health and safety rules will be enforced.  All persons in the venue, including fencers, coaches, referees, and tournament officials must wear a suitable mask, covering the mouth and nose at all times, including while on-strip.  Yelling or screaming at any time is prohibited (Group 1 penalty).  Continued failure to comply with any of these requirements is a Group 3 penalty, which may result in exclusion from the competition.  Fencers must sanitize reels and other equipment after use; disinfectant wipes will be provided.\r\n\r\nFencers, coaches, and officials should not enter the venue if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms of respiratory infection; if they have had a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding 10 day; or if they have been in close contact with a person who was positive for COVID-19 in the preceding 10 days.  A temperature check may also be conducted at the door.  Fencers who are prevented from competing in the various qualifying events due to COVID-19 restrictions will be able to petition for entry to the National Championships.  Petitions are handled by the National Office, not the Division.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons in the venue will be restricted.  Only fencers, referees, and tournament officials will be permitted entry.  If space permits, one coach per club will be allowed in the venue.  Parents and other spectators will not be allowed in the venue.\r\n\r\nBy attending this tournament, you agree that within 14 days of the date of the event, you have not tested positive for COVID-19, been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, or traveled to a known COVID-19 hotspot. Additionally, you release and hold harmless US Fencing, USFA Philadelphia Division, Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Inc. and tournament staff from any and all liability regarding COVID-19 transmission. While state and local regulations will be followed to the letter and every other reasonable precaution will be taken, there is an inherent transmission risk associated with being in any public place.\r\n\r\nDressing rooms are closed. Fencers must arrive properly dressed, or in appropriate attire to permit dressing in the main fencing area. Fencers must change shoes when arriving at the venue; do not come in from outside already wearing your fencing shoes. Rest rooms will be available, but may not be used as dressing rooms.\r\n\r\nPlease use the entrance on Rices Mill Road. Check-in will be held in that lobby.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Ave","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0975354,"longitude":-75.1451207,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":191761,"tournament_id":49218,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Junior Olympics Qualifier: Cadet","full_name":"Cadet Women's Foil","short_name":"CdWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-05T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191762,"tournament_id":49218,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Junior Olympics Qualifier: Cadet","full_name":"Cadet Women's Saber","short_name":"CdWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-05T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191763,"tournament_id":49218,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Junior Olympics Qualifier: Cadet","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-05T12:45:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191764,"tournament_id":49218,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Junior Olympics Qualifier: Cadet","full_name":"Cadet Men's Foil","short_name":"CdMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-05T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":191765,"tournament_id":49218,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2022 Junior Olympics Qualifier: Cadet","full_name":"Cadet Men's Saber","short_name":"CdMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-12-05T14:30:00-05:00","fee":"50.00"}]},{"id":49245,"name":"Florida Youth Fencing League DEC Meet 2021","start_date":"2021-12-05","end_date":"","comments":"It's an invitation only, high school team event.
