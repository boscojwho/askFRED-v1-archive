If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nDiv II MEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AMM check-in (closes)\r\nDiv II WOMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nUnclassified MEN'S FOIL: 1:00 PM check-in (closes)\r\nUnclassified WOMEN'S FOIL: 1:00 PM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.

For more information, please see http:\/\/www.fencingofficials.org\/blog\/2013\/05\/wiring-epees\/\r\nEquipment check will be open at 7:00 am on on September 30, October 1, and 2. Equipment check will test the mask, lame jacket and foil mask bib, gloves, and body cords. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\n\r\nSEEDING: Seeding for Youth Events shall be based on the following order:\r\n1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nSeeding for Regional Cadet Events will be posted when the Tournament Committee designates how these events will be seeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT:\r\nAll RYC events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per RYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\nNo fence off for 3rd place.\r\nFor Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nFor Y12, Y14, Cadet, Junior events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nAll events serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments; therefore, no events may be combined regardless of number of entrants.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS:\r\nPlease see the Athlete Handbook for the latest details on points for Regional Youth Circuit events, as well as qualifications to National Events.\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday or Sunday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday or Monday of this tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents

Events with simultaneous close of registration may not necessarily be fenced at the same time.\r\n\r\nDoors open at 8:00 AM every day for registration and equipment check.\r\n\r\nPer USFA guidelines, age groups with fewer than 5 of each gender will be fenced mixed (boys and girls together). In larger events, boys and girls will fence separately. Separate awards for boys' and girls' placements will be given in any case.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility:\r\n\r\nY10 - Fencers born in 2006-2009\r\nY12 - Fencers born in 2004-2007\r\nY14 - Fencers born in 2002-2005\r\n\r\nEquipment Requirements:\r\n\r\nWe will inspect and mark all lames, masks, body cords, and gloves. Weight testing and other weapon inspection will be done at the strip. Y10 fencers must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nPer USA Fencing policy, all saber fencers must use 800N gloves.\r\n\r\nFull regulation uniform, including fencing pants, long socks, and underarm protector, must be worn. Names on uniforms are not required. Fencers should bring a minimum of two working weapons and body cords to the strip. Rain City Fencing Center has equipment available for purchase.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil (or sabre) masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2016-2017) competitive members of USA Fencing (or Canadian Fencing Federation). You may join or renew your membership at the door. Please bring your card as proof of membership!\r\n\r\nFees and Registration:\r\n\r\nTournament entry fee is $25 per event entered. Entry fees should be prepaid on AskFRED (see links below) or at RCFC. Rain City Fencing Center accepts cash, checks, VISA, MasterCard, and debit cards.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Pre-registration deadline is Friday, September 23rd.

We'll also be celebrating our club's 1 year Anniversary, and we'd love to have you join us. \r\n\r\n    Fencers who have pre-registered AND paid by September 28th (EXTENDED from the original 9\/1 deadline) will receive a raffle ticket for our $100 CASH PRIZE Drawing for each event they enter!!!\r\n\r\n    Registration fee = $25 + $10 per event if pre-registered in advance.\r\n\r\n    Registration fee = $45 + $10 per event for walk-ins.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat is The Music City Series?\r\n\r\n     Most tournaments come and go in just a few hours, and you can be stuck with a bad result if you had an off day.  Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again.  The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\n     The Music City Series is comprised of four separate tournaments spread throughout the season, each with their own Champion and Finalists.  Competitors earn cumulative points based on the size of the tournament and where they finish, with the Grand Finale Tournament providing \"bonus\" points to competitors.  \r\n\r\n     Consistency is key!  A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament.  This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios.  A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list.  Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion!  \r\n\r\n     Each tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\n     In the inaugural season (2015-16) for The Music City Series, we awarded each of the Overall Series Champions (both in Foil and Epee) with the Grand Prize of a brand new Special Edition Epiphone electric guitar & guitar stand.  This year's Grand Prizes haven't been announced, but we promise you won't be disappointed! \r\n\r\n     Medals will be given to finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.\r\n  \r\n     In the Music City Series #1, we will include an Open Mixed Saber event to be held in accordance with our Referee Seminar with Matthew Cox.  We have not yet determined if we will hold Saber events in the remaining MCS Tournaments, and\/or if we will include them in the Grand Prize Points Standings.   \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nREFEREE SEMINAR & OBSERVATION with MATTHEW COX\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee Division of USA Fencing will be hosting a Referee Seminar with Matthew Cox.  This seminar will INCLUDE an exam and observation for the earning of referee ratings.  The Foil\/Saber portion of the seminar will be held from 9am-12pm on Saturday 10\/1 with observations to follow during the tournament.  The Epee portion of the seminar will be held from 9am-12pm on Sunday 10\/2 with observations to follow during the tournament.  The total cost of the seminar\/exam\/observation is now $100.  USA Fencing is requiring ALL sanctioned tournaments to have at least one rated referee by the start of next season, so make sure you're prepared by getting yourself and your friends\/family certified and rated!\r\n\r\nMore Info & Pre-registration can be found here:  https:\/\/askfred.net\/Clinics\/moreInfo.php?clinic_id=34201\r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  \r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Epee, Sunday 10\/2 - Registration Closes at 12pm\r\nSenior Mixed Foil, Saturday 10\/1 - Registration Closes at 12pm\r\nSenior Mixed Saber, Saturday 10\/1 - Registration Closes at 3pm\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/01\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/30\/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543 Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1695342,"longitude":-86.6757895,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":135036,"tournament_id":34200,"tournament":"The Music City Series #1: Anniversary Edition","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":22,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-10-01T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":135037,"tournament_id":34200,"tournament":"The Music City Series #1: Anniversary Edition","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":44,"prereg_count":54,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-10-02T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":135038,"tournament_id":34200,"tournament":"The Music City Series #1: Anniversary Edition","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-10-01T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":34208,"name":"Remenyik RJCC & ROC","start_date":"2016-10-01","end_date":"2016-10-02","comments":"This is a D1A ROC and Jr and Cadet RJCC.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

(note that combined age events are not sanctioned)\r\n\r\nWe will do our best to e-mail all pre-registered fencers with information about any changes by the Friday night preceding the tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nCall 267-482-9597 with any questions.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nTournament Location:\r\n\r\nLiberty Fencing Club is located at 366 Easton Road, Warrington, PA 18976, between County Line Road and Street Road (on Route 611 across the street from Target & Lowe's). Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597 or Bout Committee at 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISED 2015-16 NO-SHOW POLICY\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\nDue to the need to accurately hire referees, we are sorry, but there can be no refunds for prepayments.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228766,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":135458,"tournament_id":34275,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-10-09T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":135459,"tournament_id":34275,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-10-09T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":135460,"tournament_id":34275,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-10-09T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
