Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Epee\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/29\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48649,"tournament_id":11290,"tournament":"Div. 3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-05-02T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11554,"name":"Northern Cal Men's Saber Sum.

The qualification rules allow a minimum of 4 clubs to qualify per division.  As we have done in prior years, we will NOT fence events that have 4 or fewer clubs represented since all 4 will automatically qualify.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine if which (if any) events need to be fenced, clubs are required to pre-register their club on AskFRED by midnight on Friday, April 30th.  On Saturday, May 1st an email will be sent out announcing which events will be fenced and at what time.  If any events need to be fenced, they will be fenced on Sunday, May 2nd at Salle Auriol Seattle.\r\n\r\nWhen signing up a team, you do not need to list specific fencers as team members.  This is because the fencers that fence at the qualifier do not have to be the same fencers that actually attend the events at Summer Nationals.   \r\n\r\nAll fencers on the Senior team must be born in 1996 or earlier.  All fencers on the U19 teams must be born between 1991 and 1997.  \r\n\r\nTo pre-register a team:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=11562\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"760 Harrison Street","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","zip":"98109","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":49776,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"U19 Women's Team Epee","short_name":"U19WETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49777,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"U19 Women's Team Foil","short_name":"U19WFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49778,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"U19 Women's Team Saber","short_name":"U19WSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49779,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"U19 Men's Team Epee","short_name":"U19METm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49780,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"U19 Men's Team Foil","short_name":"U19MFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49781,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"U19 Men's Team Saber","short_name":"U19MSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49782,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Women's Team Epee","short_name":"SrWETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49783,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Women's Team Foil","short_name":"SrWFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49784,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Women's Team Saber","short_name":"SrWSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49785,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Men's Team Epee","short_name":"SrMETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49786,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Men's Team Foil","short_name":"SrMFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":49787,"tournament_id":11562,"tournament":"WWD Senior & U19 Team Qualifier","full_name":"SeniorQual Men's Team Saber","short_name":"SrMSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","age_limit":"SeniorQual","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10820,"name":"Greenhorn D & Under","start_date":"2010-05-02","end_date":"","comments":"Pre-registration $15\/ event;

Points will accrue across six events with great prizes for the top points holders at the end of the season.\r\n\r\nThe BMW Circuit will use the FIE World Cup point standing system; i.e. 32 points for first place, 26 points for second place, 20 points for third, 14 for 5-8, 8 points for 9-16, 4 points for 17-32, and 2 points for 33-64. The best 4 point results out of the 6 competitions will be counted towards a fencer's ranking in the circuit. However, seeding in individual events will not be determined by the BMW point standings, but by the USFA Senior Point Standings and classifications.\r\n\r\nEvents are anticipated to start 30-45 minutes after close of registration.

It marks the victory of a poorly trained and equipped army of approximately 4,500 over the much larger professional force of 6,500 sent by Napoleon the III to reestablish a French foothold in the Americas. While the French were able to control much of the country a year latter with the help of 30,000 reinforcements, Mexico eventually defeated the French who left the country for good in 1867. It would the last time a European power attempted to recolonize the Americas.\r\n \r\nThe Cinco de Mayo tournament not only commemorates this date but also celebrates that Mexico is probably the first place in the Americas that established a fencing school. The first official reference to fencing as a sport on the continent is contained in an official document dated 1730 that limited who could establish a fencing school in Mexico to \u00e2\u0080\u009call those persons who are physically capable of giving these lessons and who can show that they hold the indispensible title of fencing master.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\r\n \r\n--------- Prizes ----------\r\n1.

All fencers who wish to fence these events at Summer Nationals must qualify through this event unless they already qualified at Sectionals or have national points.\r\n\r\nThis tournament is only open to members of the USFA Western Washington Division.\r\n\r\nEven if you do not plan on attending Summer Nationals, you are encouraged to come and fence.  If you usually attend the local tournaments, you should attend this event!  The fact that it is a qualifier does not make it any different than any other local tournament.  The more fencers that show up, the more people qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Qualification Info -----\r\nThe top 25% of fencers in each event will qualify (with a minimum of 3).  If 3 or fewer fencers are present on the day of the event, it will not be fenced (and no fee will be charged) since everyone will qualify.  However, you MUST be present at the venue at the close of registration in order to qualify!\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Schedule -----\r\n10:00 am\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Foil\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Epee\r\n\r\n11:00 am\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Saber\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Saber\r\n\r\nNoon\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Saber\r\n -- Under-16 Women's Epee\r\n\r\n1:00 pm\r\n -- Youth-14 Men's Foil\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Epee\r\n -- Youth-14 Women's Foil\r\n\r\n2:00 pm\r\n -- Under-16 Men's Saber\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.  Fencers may enter multiple events, but they may be required to fence in both events simultaneously if necessary.  We may delay the start of some events in order to accomodate people fencing multiple events.  We will do our best to accomodate these fencers within the limits of the schedule.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that several events will be very small and either not be fenced at all (if 3 or fewer fencers show) or finish quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Registration Information -----\r\nThe entry fee is a flat $20 per event.  \r\n\r\nRegistration on AskFRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm PDT on Monday April 26th.  Pre-payment is not required, but is appreciated.  If you do not register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.   \r\n\r\nFollow this link to pre-register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=11239\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. \r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nUnder-16 - Born 1994 - 1997\r\nYouth-14 - Born 1995 - 1998\r\n \r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict.\r\n\r\nFor info on petitions, contact chair@wwdfencing.org","venue":{"name":"Salle Auriol Seattle","address":"760 Harrison Street","city":"Seattle","state":"WA","zip":"98109","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48458,"tournament_id":11239,"tournament":"WWD Divisional Qualifier -

own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, epees, sabres, body-wires and lames.\r\nThere will be a refundable deposit of $5 per

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":48650,"tournament_id":11291,"tournament":"Y10 Youth Foil ","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-05-08T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":11047,"name":"Indiana Division Qualifiers","start_date":"2010-05-08","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-02-18","prereg_close":"2010-05-05","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"The 2010 Indiana Division Summer National Qualifiers are open to Indiana Division USFA members only.\r\n\r\nPlease see the USFA Athlete Handbook for qualification paths. \r\n\r\nThere is NO walk-in registration for this tournament.

In the case of a double touch, both are eliminated.  \r\n\r\nThe mixed team relay will run as follows:  Fencers will create teams of three (bring a team or join one the day of).  The finals and semin-finals will run to 45 points.   All previous rounds will be played out to 30 points.  Oh, there will be a special \"pirate\" aspect to this relay.  Just a warrrrning. (Of course, we reserve the right to change the format depending on the number of entrees and time remaining in the day.)\r\n\r\nThe penmanship contest will be explain on-site. \r\n\r\nPirate outfits and jokes welcome.

Therefore if you want to qualify for Division 3 events, it is recommended that you enter the Division 2 qualifying event in the same weapon. If this is unclear to you, please read the Athlete's Handbook.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Notes<\/b><br>\r\n<ul><li>We strongly recommend that all fencers interested in attending national championships read chapter 2 in the Athletes Handbook. Especially 2.5 (Eligibility to Compete); 2.7 (What is a Qualifier); 2.8 (Appeal\/Petition Process); and 2.11 (Specific Events). We also recommend that you know, by heart, the qualifying paths for any events you want to fence in at nationals.<br>&nbsp;<br><li>You MUST show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and WILL NOT be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration.<br>&nbsp;<br><li>BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n<\/ul><br>As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse. We will be highly unsympathetic towards any excuses short of natural disaster, war and\/or death (and for those at war, you technically belong to the National Division, so even that won't work!).\r\n\r\n<b>Location<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe New York Athletic Club is located at 180 Central Park South, in Manhattan. Please use the 58th Street Entrance at the NE corner of 58th St and 7th Ave, under the green NYAC awning.\r\n\r\n<b>Parking<\/b>\r\n\r\nSeveral garages in the area give discounts to NYAC guests, including most on 58th street both east and west of 7th avenue. Make sure to look for the NYAC winged foot sign at the garage entrance, and ask the NYAC desk guard to validate your ticket before you leave the club.\r\n\r\nNote: This info is to help you... we do not guarantee any discounts whatsoever. If you are looking for free street parking, we recommend the Upper West Side between 63rd and 70th, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th St around 10th Ave.","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"180 Central Park South","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":42136,"tournament_id":9714,"tournament":"Metro Division National Epee Qualifiers -

If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.

What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.
