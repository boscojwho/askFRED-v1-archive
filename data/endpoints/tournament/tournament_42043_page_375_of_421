Our COVID plan.\r\nhttps:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/covid\/\r\n\r\nIf we draw more than 21 fencers we will \"flight\" pools so you should be prepared for a delay either on the front or back end (approx. 1.5 to 2 hrs). Note to remain in compliance with CDC guidelines athletes NOT fencing will be asked to leave the building and return at a designated time for their pool round. We have plenty of outdoor undercover seating for you to enjoy but equally our town has many places you can go and sit and relax. Athletes will  be given time to warm up before pools and DE. Plan ahead, bring a book, school work etc.  No coaches permitted during the pool round but yes for De's.\r\n\r\nDE's will be an orderly process and will take place 10 minutes after the table is posted for your review.  Initially, athletes will be outside as we call in the fencers and those on deck who may enter the building with their coaches. Those on double deck will be notified and so on. \r\n\r\nCoaches will be permitted to enter with their athletes for the DE rounds. Once we are in the round of 16 everyone can stay in the building.  \r\n\r\nPayment is required in advance (no door payments accepted or walk in's) Zelle, Venmo or Credit Card only. 100% refund if you need to cancel, for any reason, 24 hours prior to the event.

We have the Leon Paul fencing mask inserts (compatible with all masks) available on site for $2.\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for most events instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when. We are taking and logging temperature.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14. We will limit capacity in changing rooms to also maintain social distancing. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Limit 18 Fencers Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Limit 18 Fencers Foil \r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Palasz","address":"1110 N Rolling Rd","city":"Catonsville","state":"MD","zip":"21228","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.2856116,"longitude":-76.753953,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":185532,"tournament_id":47471,"tournament":"The Wolf Moon (Abridged) Invitational","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":14,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-01-31T10:45:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185533,"tournament_id":47471,"tournament":"The Wolf Moon (Abridged) Invitational","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-01-31T14:45:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47473,"name":"FAP-North E & U Epee.","start_date":"2021-01-31","end_date":"","comments":"PHILADELPHIA DIVISION ONLY\r\nEntry fee $40 for 1st event.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at:http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event's tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 3 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\nScreaming\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u008b\r\nHandshakes\r\n\r\nAthletes are to salute at the conclusion of a bout in lieu of shaking hands with each other, the referee or coaches.\r\n\r\nSpectator\/Coach Policy\r\n\r\nEach fencer may have ONE adult (parent or coach), on the gym with them.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"True North Classical Academy Gymnasium","address":"9393 Sunset Dr","city":"Miami","state":"FL","zip":"33173","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":25.7026906,"longitude":-80.3458533,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":58,"name":"Gold Coast Florida","abbrev":"GCFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":185674,"tournament_id":47521,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Tournament","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-20T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185675,"tournament_id":47521,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Tournament","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":13,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-20T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185676,"tournament_id":47521,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Tournament","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":17,"prereg_count":19,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-20T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185677,"tournament_id":47521,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Tournament","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":16,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-20T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185678,"tournament_id":47521,"tournament":"2021 MASTERS FC Tournament","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":31,"prereg_count":31,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-20T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47529,"name":"PFA Open","start_date":"2021-02-20","end_date":"2021-02-21","comments":"","prereg_open":"2021-02-03","prereg_close":"2021-02-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Phoenix Fencing Academy","address":"","city":"Tempe","state":"AZ","zip":"85284","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Phoenix","latitude":33.3363836,"longitude":-111.9343636,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":46,"name":"Arizona","abbrev":"AZ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":185714,"tournament_id":47529,"tournament":"PFA Open","full_name":"Y10Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y1012MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-20T10:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185715,"tournament_id":47529,"tournament":"PFA Open","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Saber","short_name":"CdMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":0,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-20T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":185716,"tournament_id":47529,"tournament":"PFA Open","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":0,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-02-21T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47555,"name":"Windy City Bronze Team Only","start_date":"2021-02-20","end_date":"","comments":"Bronze Team event only.\r\nTournament fee $ 25.\r\n\r\nThe event will start at 4.30 pm at the Fencing room.

Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.\r\n\r\nCFC is a member of the CT Division of the USFA \r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nCFC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at:http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event's tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 3 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

We will be seeking sanctioning for the senior event, if it becomes sanctioned (able to award ratings) we will update this info.\r\n\r\nSafety Measures\r\n\r\nBaltimore County is now requiring masks for all indoor activities therefore masks will be worn throughout practice. We have the Leon Paul fencing mask inserts (compatible with all masks) available on site for $2.\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for most events instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway.
