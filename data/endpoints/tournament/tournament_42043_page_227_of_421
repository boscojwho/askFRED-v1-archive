RYC serve as a qualifying path for Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. The top 50% (Y12) and 25% (Y14) on each Regions RRPS will earn qualification to their respective event at that seasons Summer National Championships. (Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, all youth events at SNs will be National Championships. The Y10 path to qualification remains participation in an RYC or SYC = qualification. Y12 has been adjusted from participation to a top 50% qualification standard. Y14 has been adjusted from the winner of an RYC earns qualification to the top 25% on the RRPS. NRPS earned at SYC or NAC tournaments remain a qualifying path as does the Y14 Divisional qualifier. The qualifying standards for the Youth NAC have NOT changed)\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and beginning in the 2014-2015 season will serve as a qualification path in Y12 and Y14 to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. There are NO National Points earned at RYC events. Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC to a maximum of 64 fencers and to the top 32 fencers at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. Given the current number and concentration of RYCs in each of the 6 youth regions, it was determined that up to 3 RYC results will count towards an athlete\u0092s final Regional Youth Ranking. If an athlete competes in more than 3 RYCs in their home region, their best 3 results will count. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.

If they compete out of Region they will not appear on that Region\u0092s Point List nor will points from an outside region transfer to an athletes point total in their home region. Railstation will sort them out. However, their participation will be counted in the overall entrants and be included when the points are calculated for the fencers who competed in their home region. A fencer can ONLY win the Regional Patch Award for the Region they reside in. \r\n\r\nQualification: \r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10\/12\/14 fencers to the Summer National Championships. \r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the regular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the Youth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament requirements. \r\n\r\nQualification paths for Y10\/12\/14 are maintained in the Athletes Handbook (http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook).\r\n\r\nSummer National Championships: Beginning in the 2014-2015 season, the Y10 and Y12 events at Summer Nationals will be designated as National Championship Events.

A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT PREPARATION<\/b>\r\nThese guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments. \r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide (courtesy of fencing.net) http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html \r\nParents Guide to Fencing (courtesy of Fencing.net) http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html \r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT THE TOURNAMENT ORGANIZER<\/b>\r\nThrust Fencing Academy \r\n35 South Broadway \r\nNyack, NY 10960\r\nhttp:\/\/thrustfencingacademy.com\r\n\r\nThrust Fencing Academy takes pride in providing families an affordable haven for kids and adults to learn one of the fastest growing sports in the United States.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot off Glenside Avenue. Venue is upstairs.  Bring food and drink as there is nothing fast in walking distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited right now and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing.

This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC\r\n2.\tLetter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3.\tAthletes with neither of the above are seeded in a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event (i.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc). The fencer information on AskFred is not official. All information will be obtained directly from USA Fencing. Fencers should make sure their USA Fencing information is up-to-date. No changes will be made at the tournament.\r\n\r\nFORMAT\r\nAll events will have one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. In events with fewer than 11 entrants, Bout Committee may elect to have 2 rounds of pools followed by 100% promoted to DEs. There is no fence-off for third place.\r\n\r\nUNIFORM REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Conductive foil bibs are required. Elastic strap at the back of the mask is required.

Fencers only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the SYC.

For Y12 and Y14, standard blade length of 30-35\u0094 is permitted. These rules will be strictly enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAREA ATTRACTIONS:\r\nDenver Zoo\r\nDenver Museum of Nature and Science\r\nDowntown Aquarium\r\nDenver Children\u0092s Museum\r\nCastle Rock Outlet Stores\r\n\r\nImportant tournament information will be communicated through the AskFred email system.
