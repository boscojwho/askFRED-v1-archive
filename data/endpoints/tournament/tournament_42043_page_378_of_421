Please review the information at https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/news_article\/show\/1151513 carefully.  If you have questions about qualifying paths or are unsure about whether you have already qualified through national or regional points, please contact the National Office.  \r\n\r\nThese are the division qualifying events for the Junior national championships (birth years 2001-07), to be held in Philadelphia July 3-12.  Open only to eligible fencers whose USFA membership is in Philadelphia Division.  If you are registered in another division, you are not eligible, even if your home address is in the division.  Please check your membership card before registering.  \r\n\r\nThe top 25% of competitors (rounded up, minimum of 3 qualifiers in each event) will qualify for the Junior championship in their respective weapon.  Fencers of Cadet age (birth years 2004-07) who qualify for a Junior championship also qualify for the corresponding Cadet event.  If you qualify at the Junior level and then elect not to fence in the Cadet qualifier May 15-16, your Cadet registration and event fees will be refunded by Division (FRED fees are not refundable).\r\n\r\nRegular fees: $25 registration, $25 per weapon.  Regular fee deadline April 19.\r\nDouble fees: $50 registration, $50 per weapon.  Double fee period April 20-April 26.\r\nNo registrations will be accepted after April 26.  No walk-in registration.\r\nFees payable are determined by the day you pay, not the day you sign up on FRED.  Only registrations paid in full are considered complete.  Signing up via FRED with no payment makes you a pending registrant, and not officially registered.  To pay by check or for questions about payment, contact Jeanne Gallagher, jgallagher2616@gmail.com or telephone 610-789-2616 (voice only, no text).\r\n\r\nAll fencers must present proof of current USFA and Philadelphia Division membership at check-in (membership card printed out or stored as a picture on your phone).  Fencers whose date of birth is not verified (see your membership card) may bring proof of age (birth certificate, driver\u00e2\u0080\u0099s license, passport) to check-in, and that information will be forwarded to the National Office.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must have the necessary equipment in conformance with USFA rules and in good condition.  Equipment will not be supplied by the host or the Division.  Chest protectors used by foil fencers must be covered in soft material and must be worn below the plastron.  All sabre gloves must meet the 800 NM standard.  \r\n\r\nCOVID-19 NOTICE: \r\nAll USFA health and safety rules will be enforced.  All persons in the venue, including fencers, coaches, referees, and tournament officials must wear a suitable mask, covering the mouth and nose at all times, including while on-strip.  Yelling or screaming at any time is prohibited (Group 1 penalty).  Continued failure to comply with any of these requirements is a Group 3 penalty, which may result in exclusion from the competition.  Fencers must sanitize reels and other equipment after use; disinfectant wipes will be provided.\r\n\r\nFencers, coaches, and officials should not enter the venue if they have a fever, cough, or other symptoms of respiratory infection; if they have had a positive COVID-19 test in the preceding 10 day; or if they have been in close contact with a person who was positive for COVID-19 in the preceding 10 days.  A temperature check may also be conducted at the door.  Fencers who are prevented from competing in the various qualifying events due to COVID-19 restrictions will be able to petition for entry to the National Championships.  Petitions are handled by the National Office, not the Division.\r\n\r\nThe number of persons in the venue will be restricted.  Only fencers, referees, and tournament officials will be permitted entry.  If space permits, one coach per club will be allowed in the venue.  Parents and other spectators will not be allowed in the venue.\r\n\r\nBy attending this tournament, you agree that within 14 days of the date of the event, you have not tested positive for COVID-19, been in contact with someone who has COVID-19, or traveled to a known COVID-19 hotspot. Additionally, you release and hold harmless US Fencing, USFA Philadelphia Division, Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Inc. and tournament staff from any and all liability regarding COVID-19 transmission. While state and local regulations will be followed to the letter and every other reasonable precaution will be taken, there is an inherent transmission risk associated with being in any public place.\r\n\r\nDressing rooms are closed. Fencers must arrive properly dressed, or in appropriate attire to permit dressing in the main fencing area. Fencers must change shoes when arriving at the venue; do not come in from outside already wearing your fencing shoes. Rest rooms will be available, but may not be used as dressing rooms.\r\n\r\nPlease use the entrance on Rices Mill Road. Check-in will be held in that lobby.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-North","address":"827 Glenside Ave","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0977487,"longitude":-75.144505,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":187120,"tournament_id":47889,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2021 Nationals Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-01T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":187121,"tournament_id":47889,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2021 Nationals Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-02T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":187122,"tournament_id":47889,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2021 Nationals Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Women's Saber","short_name":"JrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-02T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":187123,"tournament_id":47889,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2021 Nationals Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-01T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":187124,"tournament_id":47889,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2021 Nationals Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-02T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"},{"id":187125,"tournament_id":47889,"tournament":"PhilDiv 2021 Nationals Qualifier: Junior","full_name":"Junior Men's Saber","short_name":"JrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-02T15:15:00-04:00","fee":"50.00"}]},{"id":47896,"name":"Ark La Miss Divisonal \/ JO Qualifiers 2021","start_date":"2021-05-01","end_date":"2021-05-02","comments":"THERE ARE NO LATE ENTRIES FOR THE QUALIFIERS HELD AT THIS TOURNAMENT.

Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/30\/2021\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

If you have had recent exposure, you must have quarantined for 14 days or confirm with a negative COVID test after Day 7 of quarantine.\r\nEveryone entering BBFC will be required to consent to temperature check, and sign into our contact tracing log.\r\n\r\nAs per USA Fencing Covid guidelines, a multilayer, non-vented face mask, covering both the nose and mouth, is required AT ALL TIMES (inside the facility and outside to the curb). Gaiters and bandanas are not acceptable. Any violation will result in the removal of the offending party, with possible disqualification of the fencer. This applies to everyone, including those who have been vaccinated or previously infected. Vaccination keeps you from getting the virus; it does not keep you from giving the virus.\r\nAdditional Requirements and Recommendations:\r\n\r\nNo physical contact: no handshakes, no high fives, no fist or elbow bumps.\r\nScore sheets and bout slips will be reviewed by fencers, but not signed. Any discrepancies should be brought to the attention of the bout committee immediately.\r\nArrive fully dressed. There will be no changing space.\r\nWe encourage liberal and frequent use of hand sanitizer (provided).\r\nPlease bring your own water bottle (with name label).\r\nOnly weapons and strip bags will be allowed inside. Please leave fencing bags in your car trunk.

If you show up without the required equipment you will not be permitted to fence!\r\n\r\n<b>USA FENCING GUIDELINES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY:\r\n\r\nMask Mandate<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll attendees at USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments will be required to wear a mask at all times, including athletes during competition. Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\n<b>Screaming<\/b>\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty.

If you have had recent exposure, you must have quarantined for 14 days or confirm with a negative COVID test after Day 7 of quarantine.\r\nEveryone entering BBFC will be required to consent to temperature check, and sign into our contact tracing log.\r\nAs per USA Fencing Covid guidelines, a multilayer, non-vented face mask, covering both the nose and mouth, is required AT ALL TIMES (inside the facility and outside to the curb). Gaiters and bandanas are not acceptable. Any violation will result in the removal of the offending party, with possible disqualification of the fencer. This applies to everyone, including those who have been vaccinated or previously infected. Vaccination keeps you from getting the virus; it does not keep you from giving the virus.\r\nAdditional Requirements and Recommendations:\r\n\r\nNo physical contact: no handshakes, no high fives, no fist or elbow bumps.\r\nScore sheets and bout slips will be reviewed by fencers, but not signed. Any discrepancies should be brought to the attention of the bout committee immediately.\r\nArrive fully dressed. There will be no changing space.\r\nWe encourage liberal and frequent use of hand sanitizer (provided).\r\nPlease bring your own water bottle (with name label).\r\nOnly weapons and strip bags will be allowed inside. Please leave fencing bags in your car trunk. We will have limited space for those arriving via ride-shares.\r\nTo ensure proper distancing, fencers will be designated spots to stand during or while waiting for bouts.\r\nNo screaming or yelling will be permitted; however, jumping or fist-pumping is allowed.\r\nWe thank you in advance for observing our requirements, as violations can put all fencers, families, and our club at risk. We understand that everyone is excited to resume competitive fencing and to see compatriots again, but if you are not able to comply with our requests, we will have to wait until the virus is controlled to fence with you again!

Full fencing attire is required, including conductive foil bibs, fencing pants and socks that meet the knee, plastron (half jacket) and chest protector with appropriate FIE cover.  If you show up without the required equipment you will not be permitted to fence!\r\n\r\n<b>USA FENCING GUIDELINES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY:\r\n\r\nMask Mandate<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll attendees at USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments will be required to wear a mask at all times, including athletes during competition. Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\n<b>Screaming<\/b>\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n<b>Handshakes<\/b>\r\n\r\nAthletes are to salute at the conclusion of a bout in lieu of shaking hands with each other, the referee or coaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/18\/2021.\r\nLate Registration Begins 05\/07\/2021.\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/13\/2021.","venue":{"name":"Stoccata Fencing Club","address":"360 N State Rd 434","city":"Altamonte Springs","state":"FL","zip":"32714","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.6667501,"longitude":-81.4198828,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":185884,"tournament_id":47578,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #2","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-16T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185885,"tournament_id":47578,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #2","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":13,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-15T14:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185887,"tournament_id":47578,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #2","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-16T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185888,"tournament_id":47578,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #2","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-15T11:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185890,"tournament_id":47578,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-16T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185891,"tournament_id":47578,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-15T14:45:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185892,"tournament_id":47578,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #2","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-05-15T13:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":48094,"name":"Senior D & Under Sabre","start_date":"2021-05-15","end_date":"","comments":"FAD will be hosting Mixed D & Under Sabre events Registration fee: $40 first event.
