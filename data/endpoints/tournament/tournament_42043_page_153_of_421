New Jersey Cups are awarded in each weapon\/gender based on points accumulated in New Jersey Division Opens during the fencing season. The Cups are available to any fencer who competes in NJ Division-sanctioned Opens. One does not have to be a NJ Division member to earn points and win a Cup.\r\n\r\nNJ Cup Calculation\r\nEvery NJ Division Open is part of the points list in that weapon\/gender. Only a fencer's best six results become part of their point total. The points earned in a particular tournament depend on how many rated fencers a competitor finishes better than, where an A-rated fencer is worth seven points, a B-rated one is worth six points, a C-rated one is worth 5 points, etc. A fencer earns the point value of each fencer above whom they finish. A fencer earns more points for finishing higher in events with more, stronger competitors. \r\n\r\n<b>=======================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>CADET SERIES. <\/b > NJFA Cadet Series Points will be awarded to all finishers in inverse order of finish.   Follow point totals on FRED.  Top 3 point finishers in each event will be awarded NJFA Cadet Series prizes at the final event of the season. Each tournament however is stand-alone; there is no need to be in pursuit of Series points to participate.  Should there be a tie in final point totals the fencer with the highest finish in the final event will be declared the winner.   Series dates:  Sep 23-24, May 19-20, June 9-10.

If you are not sure if you can make it, just pre-register without pre-pay.  You can always go back into your AskFred Account and pre-pay up until the cut-off date. AskFred charges an extra $0.99 fee.  \r\n\r\n*For those who pre-register, please UN-REGISTER yourself or email\/call us if you cannot attend our events. Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73955,"tournament_id":17587,"tournament":"Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-05-20T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16827,"name":"Fencers Club Junior Men's and Women's Epee","start_date":"2012-05-20","end_date":"","comments":"$40.00 with preregistration with askFRED, $50.00 at the door.
