We will notify pre-registrants of any scheduling changes via FRED's internal mail service.\r\n\r\n<b>General information:<\/b>\r\n\r\n<b>Question:<\/b> \"The Kick Off is a WHAT type of event now\"?\r\n<b>Answer:<\/b>  The Regional Open Circuit (ROC) is designed to promote and develop strong regional tournaments for the Open\/Division I-A fencer who seeks competitive opportunities beyond the local and sectional level but below the NAC Division I level. Points are awarded to the top 32 places at ROC events, however, the ROC points list is separate from the National Rolling Points List. (Foreign fencers may compete though they are not counted as part of the field for qualification purposes as they can not fence summer nationals)\r\n\r\nThose who place in the top 8 in each event will qualify to fence Div 1A at the 2012 (Dallas) Summer Nationals.  Additionally fencers may qualify by placing in the top 16 of two ROC's in a season or the top 32 of 3 ROC's in one season.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\n$25 Registration $30 per event if pre-registered before 9\/9\/2011.  Registration fees double the week of 9\/10-9\/17 and are triple at the door.\r\n\r\n<b>Payment:<\/b> Please note that while we are requiring pre-registration for this event, all payments will be collected at the door.  There is no FRED based payment option for this event, so you will need to bring cash, a check or a credit card with you when you check in the day of your event.\r\n\r\n<b>Armouring\/equipment check:<\/b>\r\nEquipment check will start at 6:30am each day.  We will be testing masks, all lame material and body cords.\r\n\r\n<b>Venue and Fencing area:<\/b>\r\nFor you locals this is the former Hoops Magic facility in Chantilly, which was just taken over and renamed to the Northern Virginia Sportsplex.  It is a massive and newly built facility with sprung wood basketball court floors and lots of room.  The venue has mens and womens locker rooms and showers.  http:\/\/www.northernvirginiasportsplex.com\/\r\n\r\nWe are setting up 24 strips, the vast majority of which are grounded with score and time.  We have the option of adding more strips if needed.\r\n\r\n<b>Venue Hotel:<\/b>\r\nHampton Inn - Dulles Int'l Airport South, 4050 Westfax Drive, Chantilly, VA 20151  Rooms Reserved Under Kick Off Open US Fencing will receive $79 rate.

In the mean time, we offer this smaller tournament.  This may, if successful, become an annual tournament in a different date slot.\r\nIn an effort to schedule and start events in a timely manner, all events are capped. If some events prove more popular than others, these caps will be adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nConcerning Y10\/Y12 foil blade sizes:\r\nIn an effort to give the most kids a chance to fence in a venue with limited strips, we have combined Y10 and Y12. This means the events are unsanctioned and blade sizes will not be enforced.\r\n\r\nConcerning USFA membership:\r\nUSFA registrations will not be offered at this tournament.  On-line registration is quick and easy. Full season or $10 single tournament options are available. If registering for the full season, print the temporary membership card (it will be weeks before your permanent card is mailed to you). If registering for a single tournament, print the receipt.

Masks, body cords, cuffs and lames will be subject to equipment control. Original seeding will be according to USFA Operations Manual for Senior and Youth events. One round of pools will be fenced; 100% promoted to DE's of 15 touches (2 out of 3 five touch bouts for Y10 & Y12). Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. \r\n\r\nYouth 10 and Youth 12 events may be split by gender if more than 6 entrants from both genders are registered. Otherwise medals will be given to top fencer from each gender.\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Sabre event will use the \"Canadian Elite Format.\" At the start, it will be fenced as normal (pools, with 100% promotion to a DE Table). Upon reaching the Round of 16, all remaining fencers will be seeded based upon results up to that point into two \"super pools\" of 8 fencers each, fenced upon 4 strips. 50% of the competitors will be promoted into a DE Bracket of 8, which will be fenced out as normal. <i> Please note that SabreCave is <b>NOT<\/b> a qualifier for Fencing Masters this year, and there will be no extra charge. We apologize for the confusion from last year. It won't happen again.<\/i>\r\n\r\nUSFA MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED\r\nFencers must be a USFA or FIE Member. Proof of membership is required.  Pre-registered fencers will receive membership status information via askFRED email using  most current USFA membership data. Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":68270,"tournament_id":16067,"tournament":"Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-09-25T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16111,"name":"Fencers Club Senior Men's Epee Open","start_date":"2011-09-25","end_date":"","comments":"Senior Men's Epee Open. $40 if you pre-registered on askfred. $50 at the door. \"A\" fencers $30 with pre-reg.\r\nRegistration closes at 1PM!\r\nPlease bring your USFA card!\r\nPrizes: Go to the more info page!","prereg_open":"2011-09-08","prereg_close":"2011-09-24","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Senior Men's Epee Open. $40 if you pre-registered on askfred. $50 at the door. \"A\" fencers $30 with pre-reg.\r\nRegistration closes at 1PM!\r\nPlease bring your USFA card!\r\n\r\nPrizes: \r\n\r\n1st place: Wired BF blade\r\n\r\n2nd place: $80 FC Pro-Shop gift certificate \r\n\r\n3rd places: $40-40 FC Pro-Shop gift certificate\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMen's Epee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/08\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/24\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencers Club","address":"229 West  28th Street, 2nd Floor","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10001","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":68458,"tournament_id":16111,"tournament":"Fencers Club Senior Men's Epee Open","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":32,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-09-25T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15930,"name":"NJFA Monday Adult Novice","start_date":"2011-09-26","end_date":"","comments":"Competitive experience for ADULT fencers with less than 2 years experience.

This is just the kind of event that needs to be incorporated in every Division across the country.

Might oaks from small acorns grow, and this event is sure to generate interest and, ultimately, the tangible benefit of funds to contribute to the goal of eliminating breast cancer. As I remember my mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s final year dealing with the consequences of breast cancer, I am very pleased to see my other family, the fencing community, take up the cause.

Verify at machine. You can enter from the back and go up stairs to the 4th floor, or you can walk around the building and enter from the other side on the correct floor of the tournament (407 Memorial Room off the main lobby). Do not park in the medical center spots, park closer to the WSH back entrance. The 2nd closest parking is across the street. Read signs carefully. The South avenue parking is only if all other places are full (not likely). I would drop off your stuff at the back entrance and then park on South and walk up the hill. \r\n\r\nCornell will be checking masks for safety and enforcing USFA rules including that you must wear an underarm protector, knickers, and socks that go to the knee. Weapons will be checked for weight resistance, shims, and screws. \r\nPlease bring more than one weapon and body cord per fencer in case you have a problem.\r\nWe will hold the competition in a wonderful room that is not a gymnasium and so we must respect and treat it nicely. There will be an adjacent balcony on which you can eat and enjoy the beautiful views.\r\n\r\nPlease bring proof of USFA Membership including your USFA membership number because we will not have internet access to verify from the USFA website. You can now purchase one day membership from USFA for only $10, but not on the day of the tournament. If you do that, bring a printed receipt with the date of the tournament. If you don't you'll have to purchase a year long membership for $60 at our tournament and we will mail in your membership form to the USFA.\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed WNY  Circuit #1 Epee\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/16\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/30\/2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Willard Straight Hall Memorial Room, Cornell U","address":"Willard Straight Hall, Cornell University","city":"Ithaca","state":"NY","zip":"14853","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":45,"name":"Western New York","abbrev":"WNY","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":69217,"tournament_id":16292,"tournament":"Western NY WNY Epee Circuit #1 - Cornell","full_name":"Mixed WNY  Circuit #1 Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":34,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"WNY  Circuit #1","close_of_reg":"2011-10-01T09:45:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16296,"name":"Central Coast E and Under Foil Tournament","start_date":"2011-10-01","end_date":"","comments":"Fencing returns to the Santa Ynez Valley!
