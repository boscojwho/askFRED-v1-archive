Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY14 NoviceMixed Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/06\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41610,"tournament_id":9588,"tournament":"Y14 & Y12 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-07T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":41611,"tournament_id":9588,"tournament":"Y14 & Y12 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-07T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10911,"name":"RSFA Y10; Y12; Y14 Foil & Saber","start_date":"2010-02-07","end_date":"","comments":"This tournament is sanctioned by the \r\nNJ division and can result in classifications.\r\nClose of check-in \r\nY10 Mixed Foil\/Saber 10:00 AM\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\/Saber 12:00 PM\r\nY14 Mixed Foil\/Saber 2:00 PM","prereg_open":"2010-01-29","prereg_close":"2010-02-06","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"This is the 1st event in the 2009-10 RSFA Tournaments.

Sweatpants, etc. are fine.\r\n\r\nFor safety, we WILL be checking masks!\r\n\r\nEVENT SCHEDULE:\r\n1:00pm - Youth Foil (Individual)\r\n3:00pm - Adult Foil (Team event, teams assembled on site)\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE:\r\n$5.00\r\n\r\nAGAIN, THIS COMPETITION WILL NOT BE USFA-SANCTIONED!","venue":{"name":"Buffalo Fencing Academy","address":"256 Center Road","city":"West Seneca","state":"NY","zip":"14052","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":45,"name":"Western New York","abbrev":"WNY","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":46742,"tournament_id":10878,"tournament":"Foil for your Lovin' Invitational (non-USFA)","full_name":"Senior Mixed (teams assembled on-site) Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":20,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"(teams assembled on-site)","close_of_reg":"2010-02-13T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":46743,"tournament_id":10878,"tournament":"Foil for your Lovin' Invitational (non-USFA)","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Individual Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Individual","close_of_reg":"2010-02-13T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":47309,"tournament_id":10878,"tournament":"Foil for your Lovin' Invitational (non-USFA)","full_name":"Senior Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"SrMxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10894,"name":"UTexas Pick-Up Foil","start_date":"2010-02-13","end_date":"","comments":"Link to Bellmont map:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.utexas.edu\/maps\/main\/buildings\/bel.html","prereg_open":"2010-01-29","prereg_close":"2010-02-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil\r\n\r\nCorner of E. 21st St. and San Jacinto Blvd., Austin, TX 78712\r\n\r\nTo Be Held in The Fencing Room in Bellmont Hall (The Football Stadium), Room 302.\r\n\r\nFor more information: The local organizing committee for the event is the University of Texas (Austin) Fencing Club.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY12 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/04\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41612,"tournament_id":9589,"tournament":"Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":23,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-14T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10641,"name":"Valentine's Day Epee","start_date":"2010-02-14","end_date":"","comments":"Seperate Men's and Women's events running at the same time.

If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/19\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41613,"tournament_id":9590,"tournament":"Div. 3  Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":34,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-20T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10874,"name":"Utah Valley February Event","start_date":"2010-02-20","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-01-26","prereg_close":"2010-02-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n9am Senior Mixed Epee\r\n11am D & Under Senior Mixed Foil\r\n1 pm Senior Mixed Saber\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/26\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/19\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Utah Valley Sport Fencing","address":"728 South State St.","city":"OREM","state":"UT","zip":"84058","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Denver","latitude":40.283577,"longitude":-111.690552,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":12,"name":"Utah-Southern Idaho","abbrev":"UT-SID","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":47173,"tournament_id":10874,"tournament":"Utah Valley February Event","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":17,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-20T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":47174,"tournament_id":10874,"tournament":"Utah Valley February Event","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":27,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-20T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":47175,"tournament_id":10874,"tournament":"Utah Valley February Event","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-20T13:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10877,"name":"Heavy Metal","start_date":"2010-02-20","end_date":"","comments":"  Registration is $20, and each event costs an additional $10.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 25 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nDiv 3 Senior Mixed Epee\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/20\/2010.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":41614,"tournament_id":9591,"tournament":"Div. 3 Epee","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":23,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2010-02-21T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10884,"name":"Foil #3 - SoCal Youth Challenge","start_date":"2010-02-21","end_date":"","comments":"The SoCal Youth Challenge events are for Y10, Y12 and Y14 unrated fencers only.
