There will be no fence off for third place in any event. \r\n\r\nAll fencers must be current USFA members, and will need to show proof of membership, either by card or by fax from the USFA. (Alternatively, a fencer may be a member in good standing of another National Federation or a current FIE license holder.) You may renew your USFA membership or join at the tournament. Forms will be available at the tournament, or can be downloaded from the USFA website at www.usfencing.org   If you do not have your USFA card with you when checking in, you will be required to complete a new USFA form and pay the annual fee. The form and payment will be returned to you upon proof of USFA membership subsequent to the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers must have a parent or guardian signature (not a coach) on their USFA membership form (if renewing or joining at the tournament) and on the tournament entry form.\r\n\r\nMask checks will be performed prior to competition, and there will be weight\/shim tests for all weapons brought onto the fencing strip. You MUST wear a plastron. No sweatpants will be permitted.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules apply. At the end of each bout, fencers are required to sign pool sheets and DE slips before leaving the strip. USFA rules will be enforced throughout the competition. \r\n\r\nY10 fencers must use blades that are no longer than 32.5? (i.e., blades that are designated a \"0\" or \"2\" under the internationally recognized lengths). Weapon length will be tested prior to competition. \r\n\r\nTournament format will be pools to five points, used to establish seeding to the direct elimination (DE). DE bouts will be conducted as they are at a NAC. For Y10 and Y12, the winner of the DE bouts is the best 2 out of 3 five-touch bouts. For Y14, the DE bouts are 15 touches (three 3-minute periods, with a 1-minute rest between periods).\r\n\r\nFor additional information, contact:\r\nDavid Arias at arias@fencingclub.org or 205-515-3902\r\n\r\nDirections to Venue are provided on the Birmingham Fencing Club web site  www.fencingclub.org\r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble finding the venue on the day of the tournament, call 205-515-3902 or 205-823-4448.\r\n\r\nFor additional information on the Birmingham Fencing Club and a full schedule of our tournaments for this season, please visit our website at www.fencingclub.org\r\n\r\nRegional Youth Circuit Fencing Tournament\r\nBirmingham - Southeast Region\r\nApril 26, 2008\r\nEntry Form\r\nName___________________________\r\nClub____________________________\r\nAddress_________________________\r\n________________________________\r\nDivision_________________________ \r\nE-mail___________________________ \r\n\/ \/ Male \/ \/ Female\r\nBirth Date ____________Age________ \r\nUSFA Number_________________\r\n\r\nFEES: $20 Registration fee for the first event\r\n$10 Registration fee for each additional event\r\n\r\nFoil - rating and year _____\r\nEpee - rating and year_____\r\nSabre - rating and year_____\r\n\r\nEvent (indicate applicable fee): \r\nY10 Mens Foil - $_____ \r\nY10 Womens Foil - $_____ \r\nY10 Mens Epee - $_____ \r\nY10 Womens Epee - $_____ \r\nY10 Mens Sabre - $_____ \r\nY10 Womens Sabre -$_____ \r\nY12 Mens Foil - $_____ \r\nY12 Womens Foil - $_____ \r\nY12 Mens Epee - $_____ \r\nY12 Womens Epee - $_____ \r\nY12 Mens Sabre - $_____ \r\nY12 Womens Sabre -$_____ \r\nY14 Mens Foil - $_____ \r\nY14 Womens Foil - $_____ \r\nY14 Mens Epee - $_____ \r\nY14 Womens Epee - $_____ \r\nY14 Mens Sabre - $_____ \r\nY14 Womens Sabre -$_____ \r\nTOTAL FEES -     $_____ \r\n\r\nMake checks payable to the Birmingham Fencing Club.\r\nMail or bring to: Birmingham Fencing Club\r\n1425 Montgomery Hwy., Suite 25\r\nBirmingham, Alabama 35216\r\n\r\nWaiver\r\nI hereby waive and release all rights and claims for damages I may have against the Birmingham Fencing Club, the United States Fencing Association, the officials, managers, sponsors, and other participants from any and all liabilities arising from illness, losses, injuries or damages I may suffer as a result of my participation in this Regional Youth Circuit fencing tournament.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"policy\"><\/a>\r\n<b>Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24737,"tournament_id":5414,"tournament":"Philadelphia Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":33,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-04-27T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5679,"name":"UC Irvine Spring Fling Co-Ed Team Event","start_date":"2008-04-27","end_date":"","comments":"A Co-Ed Collegiate Team Event.

Qualification for Division 3 events is through qualification in Div 1A, Div 2, U19 or U16 in the same weapon, or by placing in the top 25% of D & Under fencers in the Division 2 qualifying event that don't otherwise qualify. Therefore if you want to qualify for Division 3 events, it is recommended that you enter the Division 2 qualifying event in the same weapon.\r\n\r\n<b>Additional Notes<\/b><br>\r\n<ul><li>We strongly recommend that all fencers interested in attending national championships read chapter 2 in the 2006-2007 Athletes Handbook. Especially 2.5 (Eligibility to Compete); 2.7 (What is a Qualifier); 2.8 (Appeal\/Petition Process); and 2.11 (Specific Events). We also recommend that you know, by heart, the qualifying paths for any events you want to fence in at nationals, which can be read on pages 19-29 of the Athlete's Handbook.\r\n<li>You MUST show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and WILL NOT be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration. BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n<li>As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse. We will be highly unsympathetic towards any excuses short of natural disaster, war and\/or death (and for those at war, you technically belong to the National Division, so even that won't work!).\r\n<\/ul>","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"180 Central Park South","city":"New

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.  We found that it had a negative impact on the size of tournaments and thus the events weren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t as much fun for the competitors.  So now you can pre-register without pulling out your wallet.  However, boy, it sure would be helpful if you showed up at the event with a $5 in your pocket to pay exact change!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958185,"longitude":-75.192582,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":24738,"tournament_id":5415,"tournament":"Philadelphia D Foil - Mother's Day Special","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":21,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2008-05-11T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":5960,"name":"NorthShoreFC Junior M&W Epee and Foil","start_date":"2008-05-11","end_date":"","comments":"Get ready Jnrs this is your last chance to prep for sectionals.....\r\nThe competition will be mixed if there are not enough pre-registrants\r\n\r\n$25 for pre-registered or $30 at the door.
