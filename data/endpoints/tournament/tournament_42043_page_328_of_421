A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>QUALIFICATION PATHS <\/b>\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/ryc-resources\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/roc-resources\r\n\r\n<b>ABOUT THE TOURNAMENT ORGANIZER<\/b>\r\nCandlewood Fencing Center\r\n272 White Street, Danbury, CT 06810\r\nhttps:\/\/www.candlewoodfencing.com\r\n\r\nCandlewood Fencing Center is the premier fencing academy in Connecticut.

For the $25 one-day membership option, you MUST complete the membership online at usfencing.org ahead of time and bring your e-mail confirmation with you.\r\n\r\nNational age eligibility requirements will be enforced; however, fencers with points in the next lower age category who do not otherwise meet age eligibility are allowed to fence; e-mail info@brooklyfencing.com to request addition to the competition.

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change). NO REFUNDS\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds and women\u00ef\u00bf\u00bds locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (maufrich@hotmail.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (maufrich@hotmail.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7662747,"longitude":-73.9793022,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":164693,"tournament_id":41430,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #1 Men's Epee 2 Rounds + DE","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":25,"prereg_count":27,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-09-23T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":41459,"name":"Rockland Fencers Club Epee Open","start_date":"2018-09-23","end_date":"","comments":"Come join us for a great day of fencing.\r\nPre-Registration- $45: RFC Members- $35:\r\nWalk Ins- $55: See the more info section for additional details.

Other fencers have one good day, and then have trouble reaching that peek again. The Music City Series is designed to remove luck, good or bad, and rewards fencers for their consistency, and helps them to establish a culture of success over a longer period of time.\r\n\r\nHow Does it Work?\r\n\r\nThe Music City Series is comprised of three separate tournaments spread throughout the season, each with their own Champion and Finalists. Competitors earn cumulative points based on a weighted point formula.\r\n\r\nConsistency is key! A fencer who wins one tournament, but only makes the top 8 in the other tournaments can easily be passed over by a fencer who has consistently finished in the top 4 at each tournament. This is just one example, but there are many other possible scenarios. A fencer who consistently medals, but misses a tournament could lose his top spot on the points list. Adversely, a fencer can miss one tournament or finish poorly, then finish near the top in each remaining tournament, including the Grand Finale, and could earn enough points to become the Overall Series Champion! \r\n\r\nEach tournament brings a unique element of excitement, not only to see who wins, but to see who will end up at the top of the rolling points list!\r\n\r\nThe Grand Prizes\r\n\r\nOur Grand Prizes have been brand new electric guitars engraved with a placard denoting the championship event and date, along with a guitar strap, stand and wall mount worth several hundred dollars!  The Overall Series Champion will also have their name and club affiliation engraved on our perpetual silver trophy cup which is on continuous display!\r\n\r\nMedals will be given to top-8 finalists in each of the four tournaments, in all events.  Separate medals will be awarded to the top 3 female fencers who finish in each event.  Custom Gold, Silver, and Bronze framed records will be awarded to top 3 places in each Open Mixed Event.\r\n\r\nFor more info about our club visit www.musiccityfencingclub.com\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Epee \r\nC & Under Mixed Epee\r\nSenior Mixed Foil\r\nD & Under Mixed Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/12\/2018.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/28\/2018.","venue":{"name":"Music City Fencing Club","address":"2543R Lebanon Pike","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37214","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1694151,"longitude":-86.6757707,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":161924,"tournament_id":40759,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Div2 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":30,"prereg_count":40,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-09-29T16:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":161925,"tournament_id":40759,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":37,"prereg_count":48,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-09-29T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":161926,"tournament_id":40759,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"D1","rating_prediction":"D1","entries":15,"prereg_count":28,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-09-30T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":161927,"tournament_id":40759,"tournament":"Music City Series #1","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":25,"prereg_count":36,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-09-30T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"}]},{"id":41277,"name":"AFC's Fall Season Opener","start_date":"2018-09-29","end_date":"","comments":"Foil and Saber Fencers!

If you pay at the door, the fees will be triple.\r\n\r\nQ: I missed the registration deadline, can you make an exception and let me pay the normal rate?\r\nA: No, the event has been accepting registrations on AskFRED since August so you had plenty of time to register on-time.\r\n\r\nQ: Can I pre-register and pay later?\r\nA: Sort-of.  Pre-register on AskFRED like you normally would, but skip the payment screen.  This will add you to the list of registrants, but note that you have not yet paid.  You can pay later (before the deadline) by simply going through the registration process on AskFRED again.\r\n\r\nQ: I don't want to pre-pay until I'm certain I can attend.\r\nA: If you pre-pay and are unable to attend, we will give you a refund of your event fees.
