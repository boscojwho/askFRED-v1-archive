The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

This is a two-weapon tournament, in which fencers fight in the round, using any epee-bladed weapon and any reasonable off-hand weapon.\r\n\r\nPlease see the links below for rules and pre-registration! The rules for this tournament are rather different from other tournaments in which you may have fenced, so please be sure to read them thoroughly. Also, pre-registration allows us more time to fence, so please sign up ahead of time if at all possible!\r\n\r\nTo anticipate some of the more common questions:\r\n\r\nEach day is a separate competition, so you may fence on Saturday, Sunday, or both.\r\n\r\nThe registration fee has not yest been determined but is usually in the $10 to $20 range, updates are still to come.\r\n\r\nThis is a dry tournament - no electric equipment needed!\r\n\r\nSome examples of off-hand weapons that have been used in the past include: Dagger, cloak, buckler, hat, and (non-breakable!) mug. You are not limited to these, however! If you have an idea for a second weapon you want to use, present it to the tournament director for approval on the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nPointes-d'arret are acceptable, but not required.\r\n\r\nAfter the tournament is over, we have the space for open fencing, so stick around! This is a great opportunity to fence people you might not ordinarily come in contact with, and play with different styles and varieties of swordplay.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1s9WSMnWt-Hh9H91wltNP39fWg6YlOmeDU-Y14OpG4uQ\/edit?fbclid=IwAR35IvihRB0JZwCbxHeO0Wx9TDkvJ3uClAt1ELNf1UULsTjfSgsbDx6mYTQ\r\n\r\nRegistration form: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSdx7gs3hxvQocbKjDwD-1WVzKnHrd3SEmZoyDnZbUexXyOkjA\/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1r0LHZUq4U3CAGtYmoebob3bkpONXER7DYB9tuwB1BMgjN6bQU92ZclBA","venue":{"name":"Bay Area Renaissance Festival","address":"12449 Withlacoochee Blvd. Dade City, FL 33525","city":"Dade City","state":"FL","zip":"33525","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.3501632,"longitude":-82.1287572,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194095,"tournament_id":49783,"tournament":"13th Imperial Fencing Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dagger and Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":14,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"Dagger and","close_of_reg":"2022-02-19T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":194096,"tournament_id":49783,"tournament":"13th Imperial Fencing Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dagger and Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"Dagger and","close_of_reg":"2022-02-20T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":49822,"name":"Orlando Cruel Duel","start_date":"2022-02-19","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for the 2022 Orlando Cruel Duel, Orlando\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only one-touch epee event, open to fencers of all ages, ratings, and genders.

The field will be divided into three pools, from which all fencers will advance to the direct elimination round. In the DE round, the field will once again be divided into three groups, per the following scheme:\r\n\r\nGroup 1 Group 2 Group 3\r\n\r\n1st seed 2nd seed 3rd seed\r\n\r\n4th seed 5th seed 6th seed\r\n\r\n7th seed 8th seed 9th seed\r\n\r\nEtc.\r\n\r\nThe lowest seed in each group must challenge his\/her choice of opponent, from within his\/her group. If the challenger is victorious in the bout, (s)he assumes the place of the defeated, eliminated opponent. If not, (s)he is eliminated. In either case, the process continues until only one fencer is left from each group. Then, the Group 3 victor challenges his\/her choice of opponents. The loser of this bout gets 3rd place. The remaining fencers will then fence a bout for 2nd place and champion.\r\n\r\nThese are the cruel facts of this special format:\r\n\r\n!. All bouts, except for the final bout of each DE group and the tournament final, may be fenced for a maximum fencing time of one minute. Bouts that go to time end in double defeat.\r\n\r\n2. Double touches, in all but the final bout, result in double defeat.\r\n\r\n3. The final bout of each DE group and the tournament final have no time limit and double touches do not count. After one minute of bout time has elapsed, spectators are strongly encouraged to jeer and mock the combatants and making chicken noises is allowed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince a one-touch tournament is an inherently short event, all participants are invited to stay after the tournament for open fencing. Non-participant fencers may join the open fencing for a $10 floor fee.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Orlando Fencing Sports Center","address":"4500 Vineland Rd.","city":"Orlando","state":"FL","zip":"32811","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.4980406,"longitude":-81.4336204,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":194211,"tournament_id":49822,"tournament":"Orlando Cruel Duel","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Because of its unique format, Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":15,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"Because of its unique format,","close_of_reg":"2022-02-19T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":49863,"name":"Charlotte Open (and Unrated)","start_date":"2022-02-19","end_date":"","comments":"GMD's first indoor tournament in 2 years!
