One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.

When you remove your name from the list the day of the event THAT IS A NO SHOW.  You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $40.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nBecause of the limited number of pistes, the total number of entries is limited to 28. If the number of entries as of the close of registration is less than 28, entries will be accepted in national point-standing order at the door upon payment of the late fee to bring the total number of entries up to 28.\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men's and women's locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.  Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7662645,"longitude":-73.9793074,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":176817,"tournament_id":44682,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #3 Men's Epee","full_name":"BAbove Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"B+SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"BAbove","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":5,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-03-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"40.00"}]},{"id":46254,"name":"Windy City Fencing  Open Epee","start_date":"2020-03-01","end_date":"","comments":"Welcome the Epee Open Event ,hosted by Windy City Fencing in Chicago.\r\n\r\nFees:  $30 per event fenced.

If you're not planning to come, please let us know via email.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #4\r\nDate(s): 03\/07\/2020\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, March 7th, 2020\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y8 Foil, Y14 Epee\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $20 per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2019-2020 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). Please join USA Fencing or renew your membership online at http:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/ before the tournament. Foreign fencers must register for a free Foreign Fencer membership through USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 plus tax per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nFoil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. We have a limited quantity of the new protectors available for sale or rental. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers in all three weapons.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2011-2014\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2009-2012\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2007-2010\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2005-2008\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=44837\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/07\/2020\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rain City Fencing Center","address":"1776 136th Place NE","city":"Bellevue","state":"WA","zip":"98005","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.6257793,"longitude":-122.1570032,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":177491,"tournament_id":44837,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #4","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-03-07T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177492,"tournament_id":44837,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #4","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-03-07T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177494,"tournament_id":44837,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #4","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-03-07T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":177496,"tournament_id":44837,"tournament":"RCFC Youth #4","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":11,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-03-07T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":46403,"name":"Tunderblades ","start_date":"2020-03-07","end_date":"","comments":"We will make mixed teams at the day of the tournament from all the sign in fencers .
