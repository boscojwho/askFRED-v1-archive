Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. \r\n-\tUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer's Regional Rank each season.\r\n-\tThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional points do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\n-\tThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet, he\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\n-\tThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events. Junior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and Junior Olympic\/National Championships.\r\n\r\n<b>Host Hotel\r\n=========<\/b>\r\n<b><I>HOTEL1 - Embassy Suites By Hilton Parsippany<\/b><\/I>\r\n909 Parsippany Blvd., Parsippany  NJ  07054.

During these practice tournaments, students will be divided into Novice (1 year of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) and Intermediate (3 years of total fencing experience or less--including other weapons) categories with Youth (Birth Years 2005-20010) and Senior (2004 and earlier) age divisions. These are PRACTICE tournaments, not USA Fencing Sanctioned tournaments. Members of other clubs are welcome to take part.\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership is required (either competitive or non-competitive). Since we are limiting registrations for these practice tournaments, IT IS VITAL that you attend if you pre-register. We want to keep these practice tournaments small so we can give attention and advice to every fencer. It is acceptable for a Novice to also \"fence up\" into the Intermediate Division.\r\n\r\nAll tournaments will follow the same format (1 round of pools, 100% promotion to a single elimination DE bracket). Close of Check-in Times for all events will be as follows:\r\n\r\n12:30 PM - Youth Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n2:30 PM - Senior Novice (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n3:30 PM - Youth Intermediate (limit of 18 attendees)\r\n6:00 PM - Senior Intermediate (limit of 24 attendees)\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Novice level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Demonstrate how to prepare for a tournament by signing up for a tournament on AskFRED\r\n2. What to bring to a tournament\r\n3. Introduce fencers and their families to basic tournament protocols such as: registration, the importance of warming up, saluting opponents and referees, keeping score on a pool sheet, how fencers get seeded for the Direct Elimination round, good sportsmanship (it\u0092s ok to be upset when you lose, but you must stay to the end and cheer for teammates), shaking hands during the awards ceremony, not using a flash while taking pictures, appropriate behavior\u0097can parents cheer\/clap for their fencer?\r\n4. Teach basic right-of-way to fencers and their families\r\n5. Show basic referee hand signals\r\n6. Train new referees and bout committee \r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Intermediate level tournaments is to:\r\n1. Reinforce and practice all of the information from the Novice level tournaments\r\n2. Train new referees, armourers, and bout committee\r\n3. Provide a bridge between bouting\/competing at the club level to taking the risk of participating in more challenging competitions\r\n4. Introduce fencers to multiple tournament series and points lists\r\n\r\nA season-long points list will be kept for the Intermediate level events, and will utilize the RYC\/RJCC points system where points for each place is determined by: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points. The winner of each event, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points.\r\n\r\nThese are the dates for the 2017-2018 events:\r\nAugust 26, 2017\r\nOctober 28, 2017\r\nNovember 18, 2017\r\nJanuary 20, 2017\r\nMarch 3, 2018\r\nApril 14, 2018\r\n\r\nThe points list will utilize the top 4 finishes (with tiebreakers determined by top 5 and then top 6 finishes). Season ending prizes will be given to the top 3 placeholders.\r\n\r\nEach event costs $20, payable at the door (preferably in cash).\r\n\r\nFor more information, please contact coachkate@cuttingedgefencing.com or call 817-428-5599.","venue":{"name":"Cutting Edge Fencing Center","address":"5328 Rufe Snow Drive","city":"North Richland Hills","state":"TX","zip":"76180","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":32.8462291,"longitude":-97.2377284,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":66,"name":"North Texas","abbrev":"NOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":151012,"tournament_id":38000,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-20T15:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151013,"tournament_id":38000,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-20T12:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151014,"tournament_id":38000,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-20T18:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":151015,"tournament_id":38000,"tournament":"CEFC Sabre Developmental Practice Tournament #4","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":2,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-20T14:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":39542,"name":"2018 SW Fencing Acadeny Winter Tournament","start_date":"2018-01-20","end_date":"2018-01-21","comments":"Fencers must be current USFA competitive Members.

Armorer will be on-site for repairs (for fee).\r\nName is NOT required on uniform.\r\nMedals awarded to top 8.\r\n100% advances to DE after pool results.\r\n\r\nPoints for ROC\r\n============\r\n- Regional points to the top 40%, rounding up.\r\n- Up to the best 3 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer's Regional Rank each season.\r\n- Athletes may earn points at ROCs in any region.\r\n- There is NO trickle down for regional points. Points earned in a ROC tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Div 1A do NOT trickle down to Div 2).\r\n- There IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION between Div 1A and Div 2\/Div 3. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in Div 1A and is age and classification eligible for Div 2 (Div 3), they earn qualification in that category as well.\r\n\r\nPoints for RJCC\r\n=============\r\n-\tAll athletes whose USA Fencing's membership division is in the region in which the RJCC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RJCC outside their region will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For more information on this Regional Points formula see the Regional Recognition Initiative Document available http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources\r\n-\tUp to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer's Regional Rank each season.\r\n-\tThere is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Junior regional points do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\n-\tThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet, he\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\n-\tThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events. Junior and Cadet National Points (NRPS) are only awarded at NACs, the July Challenge and Junior Olympic\/National Championships.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"TFA GYM@ EHA","address":"1138 N.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n***Contacts***\r\n\r\nCall 215-450-7546 with any questions.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.LibertyFencingClub.com\r\n\r\nMailing Address for All Locations\r\nLiberty Fencing Club, PO Box 364, Jamison PA 18929-0364\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/12\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/07\/2017.","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club - Bucks County","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.244807,"longitude":-75.142587,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":150547,"tournament_id":37904,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-21T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150548,"tournament_id":37904,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Cadet Women's Saber","short_name":"CdWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-21T12:45:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150549,"tournament_id":37904,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Cadet Men's Saber","short_name":"CdMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-21T12:45:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":150550,"tournament_id":37904,"tournament":"Liberty Youth and Cadet Saber","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Team Saber","short_name":"CdMxSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2018-01-21T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":38696,"name":"Engarde !!!","start_date":"2018-01-21","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for Salle mauro  local tournament of the season. see one there.","prereg_open":"2017-10-03","prereg_close":"2018-01-20","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":15,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Join us for a good time at a fun tournament.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $40 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence.

If you earned a new rating at a tournament, and it has not been updated with USA Fencing, you will be seeded on your previous, official, rating and not the new unofficial AskFred rating. \r\n\r\nAny discrepancies need to be reported to the bout committee prior to the close of registration of your event.\r\n\r\nTournament Eligibility\r\n==================\r\nEvent eligibility is determined by 2017-18 USA Fencing birth year requirements only (not specific day\/month). All entrants' age\/point eligibility will be verified prior to the tournament, and any ineligible fencers will be notified and removed from the \"who's preregistered\" list. \r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n==============\r\nY8 = 2009-2011\r\nY10 = 2007-2010\r\nY12 = 2005-2008 (or on Y10 NRPS)\r\nY14 = 2003-2006 (or on Y12 NRPS)\r\nCadet = 2001-2004 (or on Y14 NRPS)\r\n\r\nCurrent point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n\r\nMore information to be posted soon, stay tuned.\r\n\r\nRasha Abdellatif\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/28\/2017.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/23\/2018.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"TFA GYM@ EHA","address":"1138 N.
