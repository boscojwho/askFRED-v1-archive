Animal Alliance is a no-kill shelter that takes in animals whose \"time is up\" at other shelters, as well as animals that are rescued from perilous situations, including abuse, neglect, and injury.\r\n\r\nThe Animal Alliance has a long wish list of needed items:  Sheets, towels, blankets, garbage bags (35, 45 & 50 gallon), bleach, paper towels, laundry detergent, latex gloves (size medium), dog collars: small & medium size with snap closures, Heartguard and Frontline (smallest size for both cats and dogs), cat carriers, canned\/dry dog and cat food, Staples\/Wal-Mart gift cards, Ethicon Monocryl sutures (size 0, 2.0 & 3.0).\r\n\r\n<b>Each fencer that brings in a donation for the Animal Alliance will receive $5 off of their entry fee as a thank you.<\/b>\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2013-2014 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-Lambertville Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free onsite parking! Free wireless internet!\r\n\r\n10 minute walk on scenic tow path to historic Lambertville full of shops & dining!\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

In 1995, the wolf, an integral member of the wilderness ecosystem, was reintroduced to Yellowstone Park.  The Wolf Project studies the long-term impact on the Park's ecosystem. In its first year, Fences With Wolves raised enough money to buy two radio collars for the Wolf Project.  As a thank-you, the Yellowstone Park Foundation sent us a wonderful cast of a paw print. We had this made into a special trophy and all age group winners will have their names engraved upon it. This years' tournament will benefit the Yellowstone Park Foundation as a whole. To read more about their programs go to http:\/\/www.ypf.org\/site\/TR?px=1102981&fr_id=1070&pg=personal\r\n\r\nParticipants in this youth fundraiser are encouraged (but not required) to join the pack and seek sponsors to back them as they battle for the title of Alpha Wolf. Sponsorship forms, allowing sponsors to pledge per point scored, will be emailed to preregistrants. Fencer\/fundraisers will receive a special commemorative wristband.  After the competition, sponsors will receive an email with their pledge amount and a link for online donation.\r\n\r\nWe have great prizes for medalists, as well as a prize in each age group for the fencer with the greatest number of sponsors.\r\n\r\nRegistration fee is $35 for preregistered fencers and $45 at the door.

All ages welcome.\r\n\r\nFormat will be round robin, with one event for Seniors and one event for Youth (under 13). You may not fence both. If one (or both) events have 10 or more fencers, we will split into two pools. If neither event has more than four people, we will combine them and award prizes separately.  The top four from each age group will move on to the finals. Finalists in the Youth category will fence at the anniversary dinner (5-6:30 pm), and finalists in the Senior category will fence at the Casino Night (7-10 pm).\r\n\r\nThese top four fencers will be asked to choose a cause from a provided list. This is the cause they will be fencing for at either the dinner or the casino.  At the finals, fencers will speak for 2-3 minutes about their cause, and then the audience will \"bet\" on the fencer. These \"bets\" will translate into points ($50 per point) that the fencer can use to win their 15 touch bouts. They can either use the points right away, or save them to use during their second bout.\r\n\r\nThere will be a nominal $10 entry fee, but fencers are asked to gather donations from friends and family who will not be attending in order to maximize their points. Donations gathered before the tournament can be used at $50 per point to help you win in pools or DEs. Feeling lucky? You can also save them for Saturday if you choose. \r\n\r\nWe will have a prize for the fencer who gets the highest dollar amount of pledges, and the fencer who gets the highest number of individual pledges (regardless of the total amount pledged), whether or not they go on to the finals. Prizes include a month of free membership and classes, a month of private lessons, and more. The top four fencers will also get ribbons and prizes.\r\n\r\nIf you have questions or need more information, please call 503-375-9209 or email info@salemclassicalfencing.org.","venue":{"name":"Salem Classical Fencing","address":"2455 McGilchrist St. SE Salem, OR","city":"Salem","state":"OR","zip":"97302","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":44.9168229,"longitude":-123.0119382,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":104304,"tournament_id":26154,"tournament":"Swordmaster's Duel","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-05-09T18:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":104305,"tournament_id":26154,"tournament":"Swordmaster's Duel","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-05-09T18:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":25664,"name":"Senior Open Foil","start_date":"2014-05-09","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2014-02-17","prereg_close":"2014-05-08","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\nSenior Women's Foil 5:30\r\nSenior Men's Foil 6:30\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/17\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/20\/2014.\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Hills Fencing Institute! \r\nWe are located in the caf\u00e9 of Half Hollow Hills HS East.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94097,"tournament_id":23370,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-05-10T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":25676,"name":"Orange Coast Division SN Qualifiers","start_date":"2014-05-10","end_date":"","comments":"NOTE DATE AND TIME CHANGES!
