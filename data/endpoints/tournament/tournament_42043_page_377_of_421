If you have had recent exposure, you must have quarantined for 14 days or confirm with a negative COVID test after Day 7 of quarantine.\r\nEveryone entering BBFC will be required to consent to temperature check, and sign into our contact tracing log.\r\nAs per USA Fencing Covid guidelines, a multilayer, non-vented face mask, covering both the nose and mouth, is required AT ALL TIMES (inside the facility and outside to the curb). Gaiters and bandanas are not acceptable. Any violation will result in the removal of the offending party, with possible disqualification of the fencer. This applies to everyone, including those who have been vaccinated or previously infected. Vaccination keeps you from getting the virus; it does not keep you from giving the virus.\r\nAdditional Requirements and Recommendations:\r\n\r\nNo physical contact: no handshakes, no high fives, no fist or elbow bumps.\r\nScore sheets and bout slips will be reviewed by fencers, but not signed. Any discrepancies should be brought to the attention of the bout committee immediately.\r\nArrive fully dressed. There will be no changing space.\r\nWe encourage liberal and frequent use of hand sanitizer (provided).\r\nPlease bring your own water bottle (with name label).\r\nOnly weapons and strip bags will be allowed inside. Please leave fencing bags in your car trunk. We will have limited space for those arriving via ride-shares.\r\nTo ensure proper distancing, fencers will be designated spots to stand during or while waiting for bouts.\r\nNo screaming or yelling will be permitted; however, jumping or fist-pumping is allowed.\r\nWe thank you in advance for observing our requirements, as violations can put all fencers, families, and our club at risk. We understand that everyone is excited to resume competitive fencing and to see compatriots again, but if you are not able to comply with our requests, we will have to wait until the virus is controlled to fence with you again!

If you have had recent exposure, you must have quarantined for 14 days or confirm with a negative COVID test after Day 7 of quarantine.\r\nEveryone entering BBFC will be required to consent to temperature check, and sign into our contact tracing log.\r\n\r\nAs per USA Fencing Covid guidelines, a multilayer, non-vented face mask, covering both the nose and mouth, is required AT ALL TIMES (inside the facility and outside to the curb). Gaiters and bandanas are not acceptable. Any violation will result in the removal of the offending party, with possible disqualification of the fencer. This applies to everyone, including those who have been vaccinated or previously infected. Vaccination keeps you from getting the virus; it does not keep you from giving the virus.\r\nAdditional Requirements and Recommendations:\r\n\r\nNo physical contact: no handshakes, no high fives, no fist or elbow bumps.\r\nScore sheets and bout slips will be reviewed by fencers, but not signed. Any discrepancies should be brought to the attention of the bout committee immediately.\r\nArrive fully dressed. There will be no changing space.\r\nWe encourage liberal and frequent use of hand sanitizer (provided).\r\nPlease bring your own water bottle (with name label).\r\nOnly weapons and strip bags will be allowed inside. Please leave fencing bags in your car trunk. We will have limited space for those arriving via ride-shares.\r\nTo ensure proper distancing, fencers will be designated spots to stand during or while waiting for bouts.\r\nNo screaming or yelling will be permitted; however, jumping or fist-pumping is allowed.\r\nWe thank you in advance for observing our requirements, as violations can put all fencers, families, and our club at risk. We understand that everyone is excited to resume competitive fencing and to see compatriots again, but if you are not able to comply with our requests, we will have to wait until the virus is controlled to fence with you again!

Parking may be limited in front of the building, if so there is plenty of space in the back.\r\n\r\nMembership. You must have a USA Fencing membership to be eligible to compete. Generally this would require a competitive membership however this year USA Fencing has made it so members with a non competitive membership can compete in one USA Fencing tournament per season. Given that you probably have not competed in a tournament yet this season you probably still have this option available to you. Additionally if you have not previously held a competitive membership and you purchase on after April 1st it will be good for the remainder of this season and all of the next, this only applies to those who have not previously had a competitive membership.\r\n\r\nMasks gloves and, if applicable, lames will be inspected.\r\n\r\nEpee events will be self refereed and when fencers are refereeing they will be considered to have all the authority of a dedicated ref. I'm still figuring out how to do the refereeing for the foil event but we have several good referees attending.\r\n\r\nCost: One day is $30 or $20 for OF members, a second day is $10. This applies irrelevant of how many events you participate in.\r\n\r\nCOVID Protocols:\r\n\r\n1) Everyone in the building must wear a face mask covering their nose and mouth, unless eating or drinking, this includes fencers on strip.\r\n\r\n2) Everyone entering the building must be screened by the COVID officer for temperature and recent indicators of illness. Anyone with a fever of or over 100, or with signs and symptoms of respiratory illness will be sent home and not allowed to enter the building.

If you show up without the required equipment you will not be permitted to fence!\r\n\r\n<b>USA FENCING GUIDELINES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY:\r\n\r\nMask Mandate<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll attendees at USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments will be required to wear a mask at all times, including athletes during competition. Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\n<b>Screaming<\/b>\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\n<b>Handshakes<\/b>\r\n\r\nAthletes are to salute at the conclusion of a bout in lieu of shaking hands with each other, the referee or coaches.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/18\/2021.\r\nLate Registration Begins 04\/17\/2021.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/21\/2021.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Stoccata Fencing Academy and Club","address":"360 N State Road 434","city":"Altamonte Springs","state":"FL","zip":"32714","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.6667501,"longitude":-81.4198828,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":185875,"tournament_id":47577,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #1","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":11,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-04-24T08:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185876,"tournament_id":47577,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-04-24T09:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185877,"tournament_id":47577,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #1","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-04-24T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185879,"tournament_id":47577,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-04-24T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185881,"tournament_id":47577,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #1","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-04-25T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185882,"tournament_id":47577,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #1","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-04-25T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":185883,"tournament_id":47577,"tournament":"Central Florida Division Youth Championship #1","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":6,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2021-04-25T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":47842,"name":"NEUSFA ONLY, Div II\/III\/Vet Qualifiers","start_date":"2021-04-24","end_date":"2021-04-25","comments":"New England Division Only, Div II\/III\/Veteran (C-Under) Qualifier for Summer Nationals.

We will have masks breaks and there is also ample outdoor space for you as well.\r\n\r\nWe will flight pools only if necessary (over 40 entries for example).  \u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nHere is what you need to know about flighting pools and staggering registration times. READ THIS:\r\n\r\n1) You must pay in full, in advance, or you will be scratched 48 hours prior to the start of the event (refunds given with 48 hour advance notice). Further you must make sure your email is correct in askfred so I can communicate with you through their system.\u00c2\u00a0Pay here now, please. \r\n https:\/\/wayofthesword.org\/cart\/\r\n\r\n2) We will balance the \"heats\" and pools taking into consideration ratings, matching clubs and siblings or car pools traveling together. We are not obligated, nor promise to give you a favorable later start time.\u00c2\u00a0 Please don't ask me.... I know many of you are coming from afar and want a later start time. The priority must and will always be fair and equitable pools.\u00c2\u00a0Speaking of which we have created a talented and impartial committee responsible for creating and balancing pools. It's not just me slapping this thing together and hoping for the best.  \r\n\r\n3) If you are siblings or car pooling you MUST notify me of such so I do not split you up into separate heats. This is a courtesy that I am willing to do but again no promises of a later start time only that you will be able to arrive at the same time. Use email to notify me. \u00c2\u00a0Mikem@wayofthesword.org or info@wayofthesword.org. If you fail to notify me you may have two fencers starting at different times. \r\n\r\n4) It is imperative that you show up to the event and fence because the pools will be generated in advance (a risky move for us to manage because not showing up impacts the pool balance). As such you must be aware and with total\u00c2\u00a0 transparency that I reserve the right to manipulate the pools while maintaining balance as needed. In addition you can expect that\u00c2\u00a0I might add a fencer to a pool to \"pad\" and \"hold\" spots in the event that a fencer scratches last minute. This is ONLY a fail safe for me to ensure balanced pools of a minimum of 6 fencers in each pool. \r\n\r\n5) \"How will you pull this off? Show me the math?\"\r\nAs many of you already know we have a large facility 11,000 sq feet on two levels. \u00c2\u00a0If necessary we will run 6 strips similar to how we ran the March 21 A4 event which was very successful.\r\nsee those results here: https:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\/events\/results\/9D4D6048FC1C42348E3480A168B789DD \r\n\r\nFor the pools rounds only, if we are still  limited by COVID regulations, no parents or coaches will be permitted. Pools will take 2.0 hrs. Once you are done fencing please leave the building for about ten minutes before going back to your bags to allow us time to bring in the second heat of fencers that arrived earlier and are waiting to warm-up. \r\n\r\n6) \"What about the DE rounds?\" \u00c2\u00a0Glad you asked.\r\nWe will generate the seeding within 10 minutes of finishing Fencer will wait outside (seating. is provided)until they are called to their strips.  Exact strip assignments and times will be posted on www.fencingtimelive.com. Show up 5 minutes before the start of your bout.\r\n\r\n\r\nCoaches permitted, parents permitted when their child is fencing. \r\nIn the round of 64, ONLY fencers and coaches will be permitted when your time is called (fencers must leave immediately\u00c2\u00a0after the bout and may return when called for the next round). \r\n\r\nIn the round of 32, fencers and coaches will be permitted when your time is called (fencers must leave immediately\u00c2\u00a0after the bout and may return when called for the next round.\r\n\r\nIn the round of 16 fencers, coaches, parents (you do not have to leave the room)\r\n\r\nIn the round of 8 fencers, coaches, parents and teammates\u00c2\u00a0(you do not have to leave the room)\r\n\r\nIn the round of 4 fencers, coaches, parents and teammates\u00c2\u00a0(you do not have to leave the room)\r\n\r\nIn the round of 2 fencers, coaches, parents and teammates\u00c2\u00a0(you do not have to leave the room) Medals awarded\u00c2\u00a0to the top 8\r\n\r\n7) We will be leveraging Fencing Time Live (https:\/\/www.fencingtimelive.com\/) to communicate start times, and strips for both pools and DE's.\u00c2\u00a0If you were not aware, in fencing time live you can see your exact start time and strip assignment for each DE round on the tableau page. We will be posting DE bouts in 15 minutes intervals, give or take a\u00c2\u00a0few minutes each way. Our free internet [guest] password is \"getyourway\".\u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nGood to know:\r\n\r\nSafety is number 1 and we will be enforcing face masks at all times.  Further, no screaming and yelling permitted during bouts. \r\n\r\nDuring\u00c2\u00a0the round of 64 and 32, in particular, we are most vulnerable to overcrowding. Please follow the rules and leave the fencing floor after you have finished your bout. Sorry but no hanging around to watch or support your teammates until later rounds.  Let's be respectful and make room for the professional coaches (not teammates) to do their job. Please wait until the round of 8 to cheer on your teammates.  Please, be kind and follow the rules. LET ME BRUTALLY HONEST, IF YOU CHOOSE TO DEFY ME, ARGUE WITH ME, REFUSE TO FOLLOW MY RULES, I WILL THANK YOU KINDLY FOR COMING BUT YOU WILL NOT BE INVITED BACK.\u00c2\u00a0\r\n\r\nSeating will be designated and separated from each other by 6'. You will assigned a seat on the strips you will be fencing (we may even have name tags awaiting you). Do not move chairs and clump together. Note that on two of our strips (numbers 6 and 9) seating will be along the sides of the strips and as such close to the action. Those seated closest to the center of the strip should wear fencing masks to protect themselves against \"friendly fire.\"  If you do not want this seat we will gladly move you to another location that is off to the end of the strips. \r\n\r\nKnow before you go.
