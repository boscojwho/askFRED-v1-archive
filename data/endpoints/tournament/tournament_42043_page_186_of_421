Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 8 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you're not sure how to do that, click on the Email the Tournament Organizer\u009d link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why do this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00a6 it's not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  That's the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence.   \r\n\r\n \r\nPre-registration closes 24 hours prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":91756,"tournament_id":22738,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC ","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-14T18:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22485,"name":"The Great Salt Lake Fencing Open","start_date":"2013-06-14","end_date":"2013-06-15","comments":"Go to www.greatsaltlakefencing.com for complete information.","prereg_open":"2013-05-06","prereg_close":"2013-06-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":75,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"The Great Salt Lake Fencing Open\r\n\r\nGo to: www.greatsaltlakefencing.com for complete information.\r\n\r\nFees:\r\nFees are $35 plus $10 per event if paid by May 31\r\nFees are $55 plus $10 per event if paid by June 9\r\nFees are $75 plus $10 per event if paid at the door\r\n\r\nEvents with less than 6 entries as of midnight on June 9th will be cancelled. \r\n\r\nAwards \r\nMedals will be awarded to the top 8 finishers in each event with 12 or more competitors.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 8 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you're not sure how to do that, click on the Email the Tournament Organizer\u009d link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why do this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00a6 it's not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  That's the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence.   \r\n\r\n \r\nPre-registration closes 24 hours prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":91757,"tournament_id":22739,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC ","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-15T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19163,"name":"3 Weapon RFC Challenge","start_date":"2013-06-15","end_date":"","comments":"June edition of a monthly, in-house foil & sabre tournament at RFC. \r\n\r\nThis event is mostly for competitive development of our young fencers in level one and two.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 8 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you're not sure how to do that, click on the Email the Tournament Organizer\u009d link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why do this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00a6 it's not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  That's the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence.   \r\n\r\n \r\nPre-registration closes 24 hours prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":91758,"tournament_id":22740,"tournament":"FAP Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC AGES 13+","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-21T19:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22749,"name":"NKFA Y10 Season Closer","start_date":"2013-06-21","end_date":"","comments":"End-of-season youth tournament, limited to NKFA youth epee class only.","prereg_open":"2013-06-07","prereg_close":"2013-06-21","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Our current space","address":"581 Dudley Rd","city":"Edgewood","state":"KY","zip":"41017","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.007678,"longitude":-84.554215,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":22,"name":"Kentucky","abbrev":"KY","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":91791,"tournament_id":22749,"tournament":"NKFA Y10 Season Closer","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Y10 event Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"Y10 event","close_of_reg":"2013-06-21T18:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22762,"name":"Moe Found Friday Foil & Saber Open #53","start_date":"2013-06-21","end_date":"","comments":"Mixed open foil & saber.
