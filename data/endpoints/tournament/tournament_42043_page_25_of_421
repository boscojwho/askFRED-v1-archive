Camillo was a Hungarian Sabruer who co-founded the UT Fencing Club in 1974. With his instruction, the UTFC became a prominent school for fencing in East Tennessee. Unfortunately for Camille, the UTFC has moved away from the saber, and now focuses on the instruction of foil and epee. However, every January we hold a special saber tournament with pre-1976 rules in\r\nhis memory.  \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSaturday\r\n9:00 AM Div3 Mixed Epee(D & Under)\r\n12:00 PM Mixed Epee\r\n3:00 PM Dry Saber\r\n\r\nFees:\r\nFirst Weapon        $15.00\r\nSecond Weapon   add $10.00\r\nThird Weapon    add $ 5.00\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/09\/2007.\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/26\/2007.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"HPER","address":"1914 Andy Holt Avenue","city":"Knoxville","state":"TN","zip":"","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":35.95182,"longitude":-83.933139,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":14732,"tournament_id":3216,"tournament":"Bellgard Bash and Szathmary Cup","full_name":"Div3 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-01-27T08:45:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":14733,"tournament_id":3216,"tournament":"Bellgard Bash and Szathmary Cup","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-01-27T11:45:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":3236,"name":"Ratings Rally","start_date":"2007-01-27","end_date":"2007-01-28","comments":"Visit this page for full info:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.va-usfa.org\/schedule\/20070127.html","prereg_open":"2007-01-17","prereg_close":"2007-01-26","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Visit this page for full info:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.va-usfa.org\/schedule\/20070127.html\r\n\r\n\r\nSaturday:\r\nUnrated Foil 9:30am\r\nD&Under Saber 12:30pm\r\n\r\nSunday:\r\nD&Under Foil 9:30am\r\nD&Under Epee 12:30pm\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 01\/26\/2007.","venue":{"name":"Richmond Fencing Club","address":"3411 Carlton St","city":"Ricmond","state":"VA","zip":"23221","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":37.572626,"longitude":-77.470695,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":62,"name":"Virginia","abbrev":"VA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":14911,"tournament_id":3236,"tournament":"Ratings Rally","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-01-27T09:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":14912,"tournament_id":3236,"tournament":"Ratings Rally","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-01-27T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":14913,"tournament_id":3236,"tournament":"Ratings Rally","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-01-28T09:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":14914,"tournament_id":3236,"tournament":"Ratings Rally","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv3SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-01-28T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":3241,"name":"The Jabberwocky Jab","start_date":"2007-01-27","end_date":"","comments":"The Hillside Cavaliers Fencing Club presents a Youth 14 Mixed Foil & Junior Mixed Sabre Tournament, Saturday, January 27, 2007.\r\n\r\nFoil Registration closes at 10:00 am.  \r\nSabre Registration closes at 2:00 pm.  \r\nCost:  $10","prereg_open":"2007-01-17","prereg_close":"2007-01-26","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"The Hillside Cavaliers Fencing Club Presents\r\nThe Jabberwocky Jab\r\nA Youth 14 Mixed Foil & Junior Mixed Sabre Tournament\r\nSaturday, January 27, 2007\r\nLewis Carroll\u0092s Birthday!\r\n\r\nO frabjous day!

A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year).  Entry fees.  A water bottle.  Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door.  There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nYour fencer will need full electric gear, including a lame, two working weapons, and two working bodycords.

Division 1\/Sr. Team & Jr. Team in all six weapons. Unfortunately the USFA does not accept composite teams for Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nHere are a few of the team tournament rules:\r\n\r\n1.\tTeams must be made up of USFA competitive members from the same club. So your USFA membership card must all list the same competitive club.\r\n2.\tJunior Team fencers must meet Age eligibility for U19 (born between 1988-1994).\r\n3.\tDiv 1\/Sr. Team members must also meet minimum age requirements of being born before 1993.\r\n4.\tThere must be at least 3 teams to for an event to be fenced (I,e, if there aren\u0092t enough teams to hold the women\u0092s Jr. Foil team event it will be canceled). If there aren\u0092t enough teams in any of the events by Feb 1st the tournament will be canceled (i.e. if there isn\u0092t at least one event to be fenced the entire tournament will be canceled). Those teams registered by the deadline will automatically qualify.\r\n5.\tIf there aren\u0092t enough teams registered in the men\u0092s and\/or women\u0092s a combined event maybe held in order to hold the event, however this does not eliminate teams from qualifying. This will be determined and announced by Feb 2nd. \r\n6.\tFencers who compete on teams do not necessarily have to be the fencers who go to Summer Nationals. The Club\u0092s team is qualified not their fencers. For example if Kenai Peninsula Fencing Club qualifies a Jr. Men\u0092s Epee team the club name is listed on the qualifying paper work not the individual fencers. \r\n7.\tTeams qualifying for Sr. Team events also qualify for Division 1 team events.\r\n8.\tIf you have a team question feel free to contact me at this email address.\r\n\r\nRegistration is $40 per team entered.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Women's Team Epee 02\/03 9A\r\nSenior Women's Team Foil 02\/04 9A\r\nSenior Women's Team Saber 02\/04 11A\r\nSenior Men's Team Epee 02\/03 9A\r\nSenior Men's Team Foil 02\/04 9A\r\nSenior Men's Team Saber 02\/03 11A\r\nU19 Women's Team Epee 02\/03 10A\r\nU19 Women's Team Foil 02\/04 9A\r\nU19 Women's Team Saber 02\/04 11A\r\nU19 Men's Team Epee 02\/03 10A\r\nU19 Men's Team Foil 02\/04 9A\r\nU19 Men's Team Saber 02\/03 11A\r\n\r\n***NOTE*** The times listed above represent CLOSE OF CHECK IN and not event start times.

That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in convertion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers (total for combined event).

Please have separate checks made out to USFA or use your credit card.    \r\n\r\nFencers must meet USFA birth year requirements.  Youth events do not use the E1 or D1 classifications.  This means that these events are \u0093NR\u0094 until they achieve a C1 level or higher.\r\n\r\nUSFA Birth Year Eligibility: \r\nY14 1992-1995;\r\nY12 1994-1997; \r\nY10 1996-1999;\r\nY8  1998-2000*\r\n\r\n*Note, Y8 is not a USFA category and the Y8 event is not sanctioned by the NJ Division.  It is just for fun and practice for younger fencers and participation is at parent discretion.  The Y8 event howeve is part of the NJFA Youth Cup series and points are awarded toward cup prizes. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled (close of check-in):\r\nY8 Mixed Foil (10:00)\r\nY10 Mixed Saber (10:30) \r\nY10 Mixed Foil  (10:00)\r\nY12 Mixed Saber (11:30)\r\nY12 Mixed Foil  (9:00)\r\nY14 Mixed Epee  (9:00)\r\nY14 Mixed Saber (9:30)\r\nY14 Mixed Foil  (11:00)\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 02\/9\/2007\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"New Jersey Fencing Alliance","address":"54 Burnett Ave.","city":"Maplewood","state":"NJ","zip":"07040","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.720556,"longitude":-74.259493,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":29,"name":"New Jersey","abbrev":"NJ","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":14139,"tournament_id":3105,"tournament":"NJFA Youth - All Weapons","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-02-10T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"25.00"},{"id":14141,"tournament_id":3105,"tournament":"NJFA Youth - All Weapons","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-02-10T09:00:00-05:00","fee":"25.00"},{"id":14142,"tournament_id":3105,"tournament":"NJFA Youth - All Weapons","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-02-10T11:30:00-05:00","fee":"25.00"},{"id":14144,"tournament_id":3105,"tournament":"NJFA Youth - All Weapons","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-02-10T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"25.00"},{"id":14459,"tournament_id":3105,"tournament":"NJFA Youth - All Weapons","full_name":"Y8 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y8MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y8","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-02-10T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"25.00"}]}]}
