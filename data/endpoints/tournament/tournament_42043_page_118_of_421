Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes 3 days prior to the event due to the need to have enough referees.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60407,"tournament_id":14014,"tournament":"Y-12 Foil","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":22,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-03-13T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":13760,"name":"Maryland FC Harford County Youth Championships","start_date":"2011-03-13","end_date":"","comments":"Fencers must be residents of Harford county, or fencers who represent a fencing club based in Harford county in USFA competition.

Chuck Slaughter and Bary Nusz have the right to veto the composition of a team if it violates the spirit of this event.  The following guidelines (which may be modified before the event) will apply.\r\n\r\nEach team must have 3 fencers.  Each team may have one fencer on the team who has an A, B or C rating in epee.  Each team must also have at least one fencer on the team who is eligible to compete in Youth 10 or Youth 12 competitions.\r\n\r\nThe team must be comprised of three fencers whose combined score (using the following points) does not exceed 20 points:\r\n\r\nA = 12 points\r\nB = 10 points\r\nC = 8 points\r\nD = 6 points\r\nE = 4 points\r\nU = 2 points\r\n\r\nRemember, you cannot have more than one (1) fencer on a team with an A, B or C rating.  So the highest point total a team could have is 20.  (Example:  An A, E and E would total 20 points.  Three U's would total 6 points.)\r\n\r\nUsing this formula, each match will be handicapped.  (Example:  If a 20 point team competes in a match against a 6 point team, the 6 point team will get 14 uncontested points.  That figure comes from subtracting 6 from 20.)  The same will be done for each match, depending on the total points for each team in the match.\r\n\r\nHow do you use the 14 point handicap in a bout between the two hypothetical teams?\r\n\r\nBefore the bout starts and BEFORE the 6 point team knows who their opponent will be in each bout of the match, the 6 point team will allocate their 14 uncontested points among the 9 bouts of the match.  They can apply up to 3 points in each bout up to their maximum of 14 points allocated among the 9 bouts of the match.  When that bout starts, the referee will award the appropriate uncontested points to the 6 point team's score before fencing begins for that bout.  There will be some randomness to this because the 6 point team will not know the name of the opposing fencer until after they have allocated their uncontested points.  But don't worry, the 20 point team won't know where the points are allocated either.  So it is very important to each team to keep SECRET your bout order in each match before you write them down on the match scoresheet.  Otherwise, you make it easier for your opponent to predict who will be fencing in each bout.  Then the match will go to 45 points or 9 3-minute bouts - just like a normal team match.  \r\n\r\nFor those teams wishing to have a substitute or alternate fencer on the team, please be advised that the alternate MUST be an unrated fencer.  However, every team is on notice that a Youth 10-12 eligible fencer MUST compete in at least 2 of the 9 bouts of the match or the team will forfeit the match.  If there are not enough Youth 10-12 fencers for each team, you may request a waiver from Chuck or Bary.  Those waivers will NOT come easily.  So start organizing your team now while youth fencers are still available.\r\n\r\nTHE FINAL RULE:  Don't take this event too seriously.  We want everyone to come and have fun.  Bring your favorite snack or drink (non-alcoholic).  Oh yeah, keep the team names clean also - but be imaginative.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/18\/2010.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/31\/2010.\r\n<b>\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Russell Hall","address":"24th Ave & Washington St","city":"Amarillo","state":"TX","zip":"79109","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":35.18742,"longitude":-101.848569,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":52,"name":"Plains Texas","abbrev":"PLTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":58607,"tournament_id":13626,"tournament":"ACFA Team Epee Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-01-01T13:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":14146,"name":"Cancelled","start_date":"2011-03-19","end_date":"","comments":"Entry Fee: $25\r\nTBA Hall, Church of the Good Samaritan","prereg_open":"2011-01-24","prereg_close":"2011-03-19","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Directions: http:\/\/famainline.com#directions\r\n\r\nEntry fee: $25\r\n\r\nEvents:\r\nDoors open at 11:00 AM\r\n\r\nTBA Hall\r\n\r\nOpen Sabre:\r\nRegistration closes at 12:00 PM\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy Main Line","address":"212 W.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphi","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":60406,"tournament_id":14013,"tournament":"Cadet (U17)  Sabre","full_name":"Cadet Mixed Saber","short_name":"CdMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-03-19T15:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12224,"name":"2011 Chicken N' Waffle Fry Open","start_date":"2011-03-19","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-08-06","prereg_close":"2011-03-18","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Vanderbilt University Student Recreation Center","address":"25th Avenue","city":"Nashville","state":"TN","zip":"37235","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":36.1255679,"longitude":-86.8073201,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":52200,"tournament_id":12224,"tournament":"2011 Chicken N' Waffle Fry Open","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-03-19T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":12230,"name":"NYAC Mercury Cup #4 - Sabre","start_date":"2011-03-19","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2010-08-15","prereg_close":"2011-03-16","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"<b>The New York Athletic Club Presents \"The Mercury Cup\"<\/b>\r\n\r\n<i>Registration Closes at 11:59PM ET the Wednesday before the event.<\/i>\r\n\r\n<b>Format<\/b>\r\nOne round of pools, 100% promotion to direct elimination without repechage.\r\n\r\n<b>Time &amp; Location<\/b>\r\nCheck-In and Late-Registration CLOSES promptly at the time specified, with the first round beginning 15-20 minutes later.

If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.
