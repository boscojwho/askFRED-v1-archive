He was born in Grand Forks, ND on August 2, 1930. Selberg received his Maitre D'Armes from the Federation International D'Escrime in 1967. In addition to being a fencing master, Selberg was also an abstract, post-impressionist painter. He has a painting in the permanent collection at Minnesota State University Moorhead in Moorhead, MN, and also one at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. On the side of the McCormick building in downtown Fargo, ND is a restored version of his infamous sign painting of 'The Cowboy' that he painted originally in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey). Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas. Sign painter, cartoonist and artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952 where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine of Arts degrees from San Francisco State University. Selberg taught art in San Francisco and fell in love with fencing in the early 1950's. Fencing first took root in North Dakota in 1960, when Maestro Selberg moved from San Francisco, where he was the head coach at the San Francisco School of Fencing (run by John McDougall), back to Fargo, ND, where he then founded North Dakota's first fencing school, the Selberg Fencing Academy, which he operated there between 1960 and 1966. The Selberg Fencing Academy (SFA) was located originally at 54 1\/2 North 5th St. in Fargo, but was moved in 1965 to the Fargo Arena building in Island Park in Fargo. Selberg thought that fencing would do well in Fargo because of the long cold winters that forced people indoors for physical activity. Fencing competitions in Fargo during that time (including many dual matches between Minneapolis and Fargo) were held either at the SFA or at Moorhead State University, in their large gym. Between 1960 and 1966, the North Dakota division grew to become the 4th-largest fencing division in the country, and SFA fencers won three Midwest Championships, a Chicagoland Open Championship, and finished in the Top 10 at the U.S. National Championships in Women's Foil two years in a row. In 1966, Selberg returned to San Francisco where he then taught at the Halberstadt Fencer's club, and began his 16-year career teaching fencing at the University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College). Known affectionately as Mr. Natural amongst fencers at the University of California at Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, Maestro Selberg was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, his creative ability, and his tremendous sense of humor. The fencing masters that taught Charles formed his most impressive fencing lineage: German born Eric Funke, followed by American born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian-born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on Charles\u0092 teaching. In 1970, he was a member of the only U.S. foil team to ever win a gold medal at the World Masters Championships. Named one of the 'Great Fencing Masters in History' by Amarillo College in Texas, Charles was the author of the renowned books 'Foil' (1976) and 'Revised Foil' (1993). After retiring from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1982, Selberg moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the Selberg Fencing Academy and created an extensive series of instructional fencing videos and DVDs (http:\/\/www.selbergfencing.com). Maestro Selberg taught that the greatest benefits that we get from fencing are health and recreation.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Southwest Youth Ice Arena","address":"4404 23 Avenue SW","city":"Fargo","state":"ND","zip":"58104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":46.8434388,"longitude":-96.8585279,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":50,"name":"Nebraska-South Dakota","abbrev":"NE-SD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":106330,"tournament_id":26621,"tournament":"2014 Charles Selberg Memorial Open","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-08-09T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":26686,"name":"Halberstadt Summer Open","start_date":"2014-08-10","end_date":"","comments":"Mens and Womens Open Foil tournament\r\n*These events are sanctioned(i.e. are able to award ratings)*","prereg_open":"2014-07-10","prereg_close":"2014-08-09","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Mens and Womens Open Foil tournament\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Men's Foil 10am\r\nSenior Women's Foil 2:30pm\r\n\r\nCost: $25\/event\r\n \r\nThis tournament is being held in conjunction with the Official FOC Referee Seminar on 8\/9\/14(http:\/\/askfred.net\/Clinics\/moreInfo.php?clinic_id=26685)\r\n\r\nReferees come to ref to get your practical, and get your referee rating.\r\nFencers come to fence in these sanctioned events.\r\nOr do both... ref one event and fence the other.\r\nRefs get free lunch, and refreshments!\r\n\r\nUSA Fencing Membership, and full equipment are required.\r\nFormat: Standard Pools to D.E.'s with no fence off for third.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/10\/2014.\r\nPreregistration closes on 08\/09\/2014.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Halberstadt Fencers' Club","address":"621 S.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/6\/14. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 8\/6\/14) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

If there are at lease 5 girls and 5 boys, we will separate the event by gender.\r\n\r\n This is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful. \r\n\r\n Fencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver to participate. All events will be fenced electronically. There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament. \r\n\r\n These tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\n Beginning referees are welcome! We will provide lunch for anyone refereeing multiple events. Students, this is a great way to earn community service for school!\r\n\r\n For additional questions, please email: info@fenceintexas.org\r\n\r\n Brenda Waddoups\r\n Fencing Institute of Texas, Inc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=27205\r\nPreregistration closes on 08\/15\/2014\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

A preliminary inspection will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE to ensure the presence of the following equipment: underarm plastron, weapons, body cords and all appropriate weapons check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met. \r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other required equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules. \r\n\r\nFencers will only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the tournament. \r\n\r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords.

This information will be downloaded 3 days prior to the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.

Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/28\/14.

Sewn-in or channel (Leon Paul X-change style) bib. Conductive Bib in foil is required. Elastic strap at back of mask is required.\r\n<li>The maximum blade length permitted for Y10  competitions is 32.5 inches. This requirement shall be strictly enforced. Y12, Y14 and Cadet competitions, standard blade length of 30-35\u0094 permitted.\r\n<li>Any attachment to a weapon's handle must fix the hand in one position such that the top of the thumb is no more than 2 cm from the inner surface of the guard.\r\n<li><b>Epee wiring must meet the current standards in effect as of August 1, 2013. For more information, please see http:\/\/www.fencingofficials.org\/blog\/2013\/05\/wiring-epees\/<\/b><\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>SEEDING<\/b>: Seeding for Youth Events shall be based on the following order:\r\n<ul>1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.<\/ul>\r\nSeeding for Cadet Events will use National Cadet ranking within classification, then classification\/year.\r\n\r\n<b>TOURNAMENT FORMAT<\/b>\r\n<i>Please note new Y10 and Y12 DE formats for the 2013-2014 season as designated by the USA Fencing Board of Directors and Youth Development Committee.<\/i>\r\n<ul><li>All events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations.  Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per SYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau.  Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\n<li>No fence off for 3rd place.\r\n<li>For Y10 direct elimination bouts are <b>10 touch bouts<\/b> (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n<li>For Y12, Y14 and Cadet events, DE bouts are <b>15 touch bouts<\/b> (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n<li>SYC's are national point events and serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments, therefore, no events at an SYC may be combined regardless of number of entrants.<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>POINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS<\/b>:\r\n<ul><li>SYC Competitions award points to the top 40% of the field regardless of where the cut off occurs, within a pool round of a direct elimination bracket. For example, if there are 17 fencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8. Only the top 6 finishers, not the top 7 finishers, earn points.\r\n<li>Classifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\n<li>Points, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday or Sunday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday or Monday of this tournament.\r\n<li> National points are not earned for Cadet events, nor is this a qualifying event for Cadet.<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>Bout Committee<\/b>\r\nBrenda Waddoups -
