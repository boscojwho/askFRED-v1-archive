Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.**\r\n\r\nNJFA is a member of the NJ Division of the USFA http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau.

To compete fencers must be unclassified in the particular event they fence.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally there will be a non-USFA Novice competition for those who have been fencing less than one year. Please see separate details for the novice event below:\r\n\r\nFor the USFA competitions, all USFA rules will apply. Masks, bodycords, gloves and lam&eacute;s will be checked at the armory before competition.\r\n\r\nAGES:\r\nBirth Year Requirements\r\nIf a fencer's USFA membership card does not show his or her birth date, he or she must bring proof of age to registration. Passports, birth certificates, and other government-issued IDs are acceptable; school IDs are not.\r\n\r\nY10: 2007-2010\r\nY12: 2005-2008\r\nSenior: 2004 and earlier\r\n\r\nWaiver:\r\nAll competitors must submit a copy of the Gulf Coast Division waiver of liability and consent to treat form. Copies will be available at the venue. You can also download and print your own: https:\/\/app.box.com\/s\/j8a12ltuhjrckczgj8bk\r\n\r\nFencers under age 18 must have a parent's signature on this form.\r\n\r\nUSFA\/US Fencing Membership:\r\nCurrent competitive membership of the USFA required. Membership forms will be available at the venue, but it is preferable that you join or renew online 2 weeks or more prior to the tournament. If your membership is not pre-validated, you must be prepared to show proof of USFA membership, or at the door, fill out a membership form and pay at that time.\r\n\r\n\r\nGFC has a only a few lam&eacute;s available. If we have one in your size you can rent one for $20.00. However, it would be better to borrow one from your club or a club mate, just to make sure you will be able to fence in your event.\r\n\r\nALL EVENTS will be fenced in round-robin pools followed by 100% promotion to Direct Elimination rounds.\r\n\r\nMemberships will be available at the venue. SERIOUS NOTE: If your method of payment to the USFA fails you will be retroactively black carded from your events.\r\n\r\nPersons under age 18 MUST have a parent's signature on the USFA form.\r\n \r\nDiversions:\r\nHere is a list of links for things to do in Galveston when you are not fencing.\r\n\r\nTexas Seaport Museum \/ The Tall Ship, Elissa\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonhistory.org\/Texas_Seaport_Museum.asp\r\n\r\nGalveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier: http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pleasurepier\/\r\n\r\nMoody Gardens\r\nhttp:\/\/www.moodygardens.com\/attractions\/\r\n\r\nSchlitterbahn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.schlitterbahn.com\/gal\/\r\n\r\nGalveston Railroad Museum\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galvestonrrmuseum.com\/\r\n\r\nLone Star Flight Museum\r\nhttp:\/\/www.lsfm.org\/\r\n\r\nGalveston Island Duck Tours: http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/ducktours\/\r\n\r\nPier 21 Theater: (Three different films: The Great Storm, Galveston-Gateway to the Gulf; and The Pirate Island of Jean Laffite) http:\/\/www.galveston.com\/pier21theatre\/\r\n\r\nPirates!

Being a tourist town, Galveston hotels run the gamut. Of really nice hotels close to the venue there are two that jump out:\r\n \r\nThe Tremont House \r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSTH\/main.wnt?cid=14807\r\n \r\nThe Hotel Galvez\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSHG\/main.wnt?cid=14749\r\n \r\nBoth are \"historic\" hotels operated by Wyndham. Tremont is in the Historic Strand District. The Galvez is on the beach. Neither is quite five minutes from the venue.\r\n \r\nFurther down Seawall Blvd, facing the Gulf of Mexico are three hotels, side by side, offering different price points, as they say. All three face the sea. Most of your drive to the venue would be along Seawall Blvd. from either of these three. It can be a bit busy on a weekend, but you do have the Gulf of Mexico on the right side pretty much 90%\r\nof the way, which can make up for it. In \"high traffic times\" allow fifteen minutes to reach the venue.\r\n \r\nThe San Luis http:\/\/www.sanluisresort.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Hilton http:\/\/www.galvestonhilton.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Holiday Inn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/holidayinnresorts\/hotels\/us\/en\/galveston\/glssb\/hoteldetail\r\n \r\nOne other option that is different but might be fun is Harbor House,which is located along the Galveston Waterfront (near the cruise ship terminals and the waterfront restaurants).\r\nhttp:\/\/www.harborhousepier21.com\/ \r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made.<\/b> You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

This tournament is held in honor of Ryder Darwin, a founding member of our club who tragically lost his life at the age of 21.  He was a 3 time national medalist, a beloved friend, and drawn to fencing for the personal challenges offered to him by participation in our sport. This event began in 2014 as a way to honor his life and we are proud to offer the 2017 Ryder Cup as part of the Regional Cadet Junior Circuit and Regional Open Circuit. \r\n\r\nJeff Kallio & Jennifer Oldham\r\nMid-South Fencers' Club\r\nDurham, NC\r\ninfo@midsouthfencersclub.org\r\n(919)-286-3100\r\n","venue":{"name":"Mid-South Fencers Club","address":"121 North Gregson Street","city":"Durham","state":"NC","zip":"27701","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":36.0007123,"longitude":-78.9090288,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":59,"name":"North Carolina","abbrev":"NC","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":148275,"tournament_id":37432,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC\/DIV1A ROC (Region 6)","full_name":"Cadet Women's Saber","short_name":"CdWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":17,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-29T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"120.00"},{"id":148276,"tournament_id":37432,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC\/DIV1A ROC (Region 6)","full_name":"Cadet Men's Saber","short_name":"CdMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":30,"prereg_count":31,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-28T08:00:00-04:00","fee":"120.00"},{"id":148277,"tournament_id":37432,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC\/DIV1A ROC (Region 6)","full_name":"Junior Women's Saber","short_name":"JrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":20,"prereg_count":22,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-29T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"120.00"},{"id":148278,"tournament_id":37432,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC\/DIV1A ROC (Region 6)","full_name":"Junior Men's Saber","short_name":"JrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":33,"prereg_count":35,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-28T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"120.00"},{"id":148279,"tournament_id":37432,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC\/DIV1A ROC (Region 6)","full_name":"Div1A Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"Dv1ASrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div1A","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"B1","entries":15,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-28T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"120.00"},{"id":148280,"tournament_id":37432,"tournament":"Ryder Cup Memorial Saber RJCC\/DIV1A ROC (Region 6)","full_name":"Div1A Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"Dv1ASrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div1A","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":23,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-10-29T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"120.00"}]},{"id":37692,"name":"2017 Halloween Open","start_date":"2017-10-28","end_date":"","comments":"$30 entry fee - $10 each additional event - college students $20 first event, $10 each additional event with valid ID.  \r\n\r\nLocation:  Weaver gymnasium, on Eastern Kentucky University campus. \r\n\r\n**** See \"More Info\" link for Parking ****","prereg_open":"2017-08-08","prereg_close":"2017-10-27","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"$30 entry fee - $10 each additional event - college students $20 first event, $10 each additional event with valid ID.  \r\n\r\nLocation:  Weaver gymnasium, on Eastern Kentucky University campus.\r\n\r\n***PARKING **** \r\n\r\nDue to construction, parking lot next to Weaver is limited.
