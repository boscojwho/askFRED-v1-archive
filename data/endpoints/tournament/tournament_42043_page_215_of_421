Bob, who passed away in 2009, had a long fencing career since his youth, and in his time, he became a saber champion. In 2004, Bob founded the Machias Fencing Club as a USFA club in Machias, Maine and for several years committed himself to teaching fencing to the community. He developed a fencing program at the University of Maine in Machias for adults and college students, and provided fencing instruction for Adult Education. Bob was also involved in our regional activities in refereeing, hosting tournaments and promoting fencing though his devoted instruction and coaching. Bob inspired many fencers in Maine and we pay tribute to him and will always remember his contributions to the fencing community here in Maine.\r\n\r\nUSFA Events Eligibility (as per USFA Rules): \r\nMust be a USA Fencing Member or Canadian Federation Member and events are conducted with electric gear. You can join USA Fencing at the tournament or on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org.\r\n\r\nB & E USFA Events - Must be born 2000 or earlier. In any tournament where children can fence with adults, the fencer must be 13 by January 1 of the competition season (August - July). \r\nB & Under = B,C,D,E,U classifications may participate.\r\nE Events = E & Unrated fencers may participate. \r\nMixed = Men & Women combined. \r\nY14 USFA Event - Must be born 1999 - 2002. \r\nElectric gear is required for all USFA Events.\r\n\r\nSpecial Note (Rule Change): All USFA Foil Events require mask with conductive bibs and mask cords. Please also note changes in formats for Y10 and Y12 direct elimination rounds.\r\n\r\nYouth Development Practice Tournaments: DESF will begin a new format for practice tournaments for youth. This format is designed to assist youth to have a fuller learning experience at fencing tournaments and to address youth events that have had historically low turnouts. The format involves fencers as volunteer mentors to assist in creating bouting opportunities for youth with the goal of developing a stronger local field of youth fencers. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nNovice DESF Practice Tournaments: Novice Events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability. These events are sponsored by DESF as practice tournaments for new fencers and are not Northeast Division sanctioned USFA events. For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nPre-registration & Entry Fees:\r\nUSFA sanctioned events:\r\nEntry fees: $15 per event at the door. $12 per event if you pre-register on Ask-FRED by Friday, 5\/23\/14. These fees only apply to DESF hosted tournaments. Pre-registration closes Friday, 5\/23\/14 at 9:00 PM.\r\n\r\nYouth Development & Novice events: $10 per event per person.\r\n\r\nCourtesy of pre-registration is highly encouraged, but those wishing to register at the door are welcome. All volunteer donations to the referee fund are welcome and highly appreciated to help pay or discount the entry fees of those who volunteer to referee. When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USFA Events will be awarded according to USFA tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers. If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 5\/21\/14.

The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 touches are scored, whichever comes first.  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nY 12 & Y14 DE format - direct elimination bouts will be for 15 touches or will end when 3 periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period have passed.  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nMedals will be awarded to the Top 8 Fencers in all Y-8 events and to the Top 3 Fencers in the Y-10, Y12, & Y 14 events. There are no fence-offs for third place.\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events do not use the E1 or D1 classifications. This means that these events are not rated until they achieve the C1 level or higher. See the USFA ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\nPhotography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws or who is excluded is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not competed.\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout his opponent will be declared the winner of that bout.  A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\n50-58 Burnett Avenue, Maplewood, NJ (use 54 Burnett Avenue for MapQuest).
