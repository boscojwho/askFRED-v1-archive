If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament.

SYCs are a group of events throughout the country for youth fencers in the Y14, Y12, and Y10 age categories in all six weapons. They provide an opportunity for young athletes to experience elite competition, earn national points, and prepare for future national events while limiting travel time and expenses for the fencers and families. This SYC will provide an opportunity to earn national youth rolling points; additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals for Y14, Y12, and Y10 age categories. National Points will be awarded to those fencers placing in the top 40% of the competitive field regardless of where the cut occurs. Fencers must fence in at least one Regional or Super Youth Competition in the current season to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nThe Athlete\u0092s Handbook:(http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for summer nationals and should be used as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\n<b>Cost Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net. Payment must be made via Askfred.net. Registration is not complete until payment is made. The regular fee registration period begins on 02\/29\/16 and ends at 11:59pm EST on 04\/03\/16. The triple-fee registration period begins on 04\/04\/16 and ends at 11:59pm EST on 04\/25\/16. All registrations made after 11:59pm EST on 04\/25\/16 will be considered walk-ins. If you are listed as an \u0093incomplete\u0094 registrant on FRED\u0092s list, you will be charged the walk-in event fee.<\/i>\r\n\r\nRegular Period Registration fee: $30\r\nRegular Period Fee per Event: $40\r\n\r\nTriple-Fee Period Registration fee: $90\r\nTriple-Fee Period Fee per Event: $120\r\n\r\nWalk-In Period Registration fee: $290\r\nWalk-In Period Fee per Event: $120\r\n\r\nRegistration fees will not be refunded. There are no exceptions. Prior to April 3rd, 100% of the event fee will be refunded if the bout committee is contacted with a refund request. After April 3rd, there will be no refunds of the event fee. All refund requests will be responded to after the conclusion of the tournament, during the first week in May.\r\n\r\nFees are set by the Youth Development Committee and exceptions cannot be made. Please make your registrations early to avoid complications.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table. \r\nEngraved medals will be awarded to the top 8 finishers in each event. Classifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. View USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698401-classification-chart\r\n\r\n<b>Seeding:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating and points information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating and points standing are correct with the USFA, and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing\r\nCurrent points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n1. Current National Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nLive tournament seeding and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results during the event. \r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event.

Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required. You MUST show your USFA card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join at the door (parent signature required for fencers under age 18), however please arrive with a completed form (available at usfencing.org) or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USFA for your USFA membership payment.\r\n\r\nEvent registration is capped at 32 fencers for each event. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.\r\nIt is separate men's and women's event, but they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nEntry fee: $35 per event if prepaid thru AskFRED, walk-ins (if room) $40.  We accept credit cards or cash for walk-in entries.\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone number so you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. Fencers will be pulled in from the wait list in the order that their requests have been received. \r\n\r\nIf you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. Unavoidable circumstances can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, but please call or email tournament organizers. \r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Men's Sabre \u0096 9:00 am\r\nSenior Women's Sabre - 12:00 pm\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/29\/2016.\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by American Institute of Fencing (AIF).

If you do not register by the deadline, you will be charged DOUBLE fees on the day of the event.\r\n\r\nEvent fees must be paid at the door.  We accept cash, check (made out to \"WWD\"), and credit cards.\r\n\r\nFollow this link to register online with AskFRED:\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=32449\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Event Format -----\r\n<b>NOTE FORMAT CHANGE<\/b>\r\nAll events will be run as a single round of pools followed by a direct elimination.\r\n\r\n----- Tournament Rules -----\r\nAll fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA Western Washington Division.  You may join or renew your USFA membership at the door.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required, including plastron, knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names are not required on jackets, lames, or knickers.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Age Eligibility -----\r\nEligibility is based on entirely on birth year, regardless of when a fencer's birthday falls during the year.\r\n\r\nSenior (Div II\/III) - Born 2002 or earlier\r\nYouth-14 - Born 2001 - 2004\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Equipment Check -----\r\nPlease arrive early to allow time for equipment checks. We will be checking masks, lames, and bodycords.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Am I Pre-Qualified? -----\r\nThe qualification rules for Division II\/III have changed slightly this year. \r\n\r\nMany fencers in the division may already be pre-qualified for Division II and III, as well as Y14.  If you finished in the top 40% at a Div II ROC like Bladefest, you have earned Div II Regional Points and will be qualified for Div II\/III.  Y14 fencers with Y14 national points are auto-qualified for the Y14 event.\r\n\r\nFencer with Div II Regional Points are NOT skipped when calculating the qualifiers at this event.  (This is a new change to the qualification rule.)  Therefore, if you have regional points (and are therefore already qualified) but fence and finish in the top 25%, you will \"take up\" a qualification slot that could otherwise go to another fencer.  So you may not want to fence at this event so as to let other people qualify.\r\n\r\n\r\n----- Petitions -----\r\nIf you are unable to attend the qualifier event, you may file a petition with the USFA requesting entry.  In general, petitions are appropriate for people who were unable to attend due to illness or a schedule conflict (such as being out of town on business.)  \r\n\r\nContact chair@wwdfencing.org for more

Each repechage tournament will be smaller than its counterpart open, and the competition will not be as steep. But each is still a chance for glory, and an opportunity to gain valuable tournament experience against opponents of similar caliber. The repechage events are scheduled to start two hours after close of registration for the main events. Again, repechage tournaments are free with paid registration to an open of the same weapon.  \r\n\r\nThis tournament is a fundraiser in support of the UCSB Fencing Team's travel to Collegiate National Championships every Spring. We just recently returned from Rhode Island!  \r\n\r\nAll USFA rules regarding equipment and safety will be strictly enforced.  Participants must show proof of USFA membership if they are not included in the USFA database by April 18.  Membership may be purchased at the event.\r\n\r\nWe will have prizes for winners in all events.  And yes, we checked with the National Office to confirm the legitimacy of the format.  It will be a lot of fencing!  \r\n\r\nRegistration\r\nEntry Fee is 30$\/event with preregistration on FRED.\r\n50$\/event without FRED registration.\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/27\/2016 at midnight.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil: 10 am\r\nMixed Epee: 12 pm \r\nMixed Saber: 1 pm\r\n\r\nLocation and Parking\r\nThe Ol\u00e9 Open will be held in the UCSB Recreation Center.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\n\r\n*****\r\n\r\nLIBERTY FENCING CLUB LLC\r\nLOCATIONS ON THE MAIN LINE AND BUCKS COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA:\r\n\r\n**TOURNAMENT LOCATION In Bucks County**:\r\n- 366 Easton Road\r\n- Warrington, PA 18976\r\n\r\n**At Haverford College** (private lessons only):\r\n- Fencing Salle\r\n- Douglas B.

The Summer National Championships are held this year in Dallas, TX June 29-July 9. \r\n\r\nDoors open at 8:00 AM and registration and equipment check opens at 8:30 AM. Times listed are \"close of registration.\" That being said, we encourage everyone (especially beginners to the sport) to be at the venue AT LEAST one half hour before the CLOSE of your event, to make sure you can sign in and get your equipment checked and approved BEFORE the close of registration for your event. \r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2015-2016) competitive members of the USFA and must be members of the Oregon Division; fencers from other divisions are not eligible to compete. Y14 fencers must fall in that age bracket OR the athlete must be on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket.\r\n\r\nPermanent residents who have not represented another country in the last three years may participate. If we need you to fence in order to qualify more fencers (i.e. bring the event size to 13 or 17 fencers), and you are already auto-qualified for the SN, fees are waived for you. Otherwise, we discourage auto-qualified fencers from fencing in the qualifier.\r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD! All fencers must be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership. Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nIn each event, the top 25% (minimum of 3, rounded up) who were not previously qualified (i.e. through a ROC) will qualify for SNQ. If 3 or fewer fencers show up for an event, the event will not be fenced, and all will qualify. Fencers that earn qualification at the DIV II events will automatically qualify for the corresponding DIV III events event (if rating-eligible.)\r\n\r\nPre-registration and pre-payment (the latter is a new requirement) on FRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Friday, April 8. If you sign up and pay on-line by that time, your discounted registration fees are $20 per fencer, plus $20 per event (i.e., a total of $40 for one event). You can sign-up and pay on-line after that time, but your fees will increase to triple registration fee and double event fee (through April 15, 11:59pm). Starting April 16, you may fence with a fee of double registration fee and triple event fee (this is the only circumstance in which you will be allowed to pay at the door \u0096 please bring cash or a check, made out to the Oregon Division, credit cards not accepted). \r\n\r\nIn the case that you pre-pay, and then must withdraw, the following is the Division refund policy:\r\n\u0095 By the close of on-time pre-registration \u0096 Full refund minus $5 because the Division is liable for the AskFred % fee.\r\n\u0095 Up to 11:59pm the Thursday before the event \u0096 Event fee refund only (must be a request via email to the board.)\r\n\u0095 Day of Event \u0096 Event fee refund only upon a verifiable medical withdrawal before event start.\r\n\u0095 No refunds after the fact.\r\n\r\nFull USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. Foil events require conductive foil masks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. Weapons are checked on the strip. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate that we will offer an opportunity to get your equipment tested the night before the event, depending on Saturday morning numbers, and will confirm that fact through AskFred. Please make sure that AskFred has your current email address. \r\n\r\nHere are additional important notes:\r\nHealthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area. \r\n\r\nOur qualifier is entirely staffed (with the exception of the referees) by volunteers, without whom this event would not take place, so please contact the tournament organizers at Board@usfa-or.org if you can help a shift. \r\n\r\nAs a last note, in 2013, the USFA Board of Directors adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines new requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOregon Division members are invited to qualify for Summer Nationals. Only Oregon members may compete. Proof of USFA membership required.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/25\/2016.\r\nPreregistration closes on 04\/29\/2016.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Northwest

Pre-registration is done via AskFRED by midnight (Eastern Time) on the Thursday before Saturday events and on the Friday before Sunday events.  If payment is done at the same time as pre-registration, the entry fee is $30.  There is an extra $20 late fee for onsite registration or for onsite payment of unpaid pre-registrations.  All onsite payments must be made in cash (exact change).\r\n\r\nLocation and Time\r\n\r\nFencers and spectators must use the back entrance of the New York Athletic Club just east of the corner of 58th Street and 7th Avenue.  Tell the guard at that entrance that you are there for the fencing competition and he will direct you to the stairway.  The fencing room is one flight down in the basement.  The men\u0092s and women\u0092s locker rooms are across the hall from the fencing room.\r\n\r\nCheck-in and onsite registration begins about thirty minutes before the time specified for each event and CLOSES promptly at the time specified for each event.  \"I am going to be late\" phone calls will not be accepted in lieu of physical presence when checking in.  If there are multiple events on one day, you must check in separately for each event you wish to compete in.  The first round of competition usually begins 15-20 minutes later.  \r\n\r\nSubway and Parking\r\n\r\nThe NYAC is located within one block of the following subways:\r\nN, R, Q (57th Street and 7th Avenue Station)\r\nA, B, C, D (Columbus Circle Station)\r\nF (57th Street and 6th Avenue Station)\r\n\r\nThere are several garages in the area, including on 58th Street just east of the club. If you are looking for free street parking, your best bet would probably be the Upper West Side between 63rd  and 70th Streets, or directly west of the NYAC on 58th Street around 10th Ave.\r\n\r\nSanctioning and Membership\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA Metropolitan Division sanctioned event.  Classifications will be awarded as earned.  You do NOT have to be a NYAC member to compete, however you MUST be a USFA or FIE member.    Becoming a new member of the USFA or renewing your membership is best done online via the USFA web site (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership\/Individuals.aspx).  If the membership is taken out or renewed after midnight of the Thursday before Saturday events or the Friday before Sunday events, proof of this must be shown at time of check-in.  Anyone whose membership is not recorded on the USFA web site and does not have adequate proof of membership will be required to take out or renew their membership onsite before being allowed to check-in.\r\n\r\nJunior (U19 or U20) and Cadet (U17 and U16) Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as junior or cadet events, the entries are restricted to fencers of a certain age.  For the 2015-16 season up to the Junior Olympic Championships in February 2016, junior events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1996-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Cadet point standings at the time of the event.  Cadet events are restricted to fencers born in the years 1999-2002 except that a fencer born after 2002 can fence if that fencer is on the National Youth 14 point standings at the time of the event.  After the JO Championships, age range for the junior events becomes 1997-2003 and for the cadet events 2000-2003.\r\n\r\nQualifying Events\r\n\r\nFor competitions listed as qualifying events, the following additional rules apply:\r\n\r\n\u0095  You absolutely, positively must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in qualifying events.  You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing).  If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively will not let you compete.  Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter.  Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, or your attendance at an out of town school does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers.  If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.\r\n\r\n\u0095  You must check in for any events you pre-register for even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots.  Fencers, even those that have pre-registered, who do not check in in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted to the National Office as a qualified competitor.  BE THERE and BE ON TIME.\r\n\r\n\u0095  If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).","venue":{"name":"NYAC","address":"193 W 58 Street","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7661675,"longitude":-73.9793986,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":126683,"tournament_id":32083,"tournament":"NYAC Mercury Cup #4 Mixed Epee 1 Touch Tournament","full_name":"Div1 Senior Mixed C and Above Epee","short_name":"Dv1SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div1","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":24,"prereg_count":26,"is_team":false,"description":"C and Above","close_of_reg":"2016-05-01T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"30.00"}]},{"id":33117,"name":"FVFA D & Under Foil\/Saber","start_date":"2016-05-01","end_date":"","comments":"$30 per event WITH Askfred preregistration; $35 without (FVFA Members save $5 per event).

Regional RJCC Points are only earned in the fencers own region (for this event, regional points will be awarded to each competitor residing in Region 3 - your Region is assigned based on Division affiliation). RJCC uses this formula: ((# entries \u0096 place + 1) \/ # entries) x 100 points). The winner of each RJCC, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. Best 2 results from RJCCs within the athlete\u0092s region count toward Regional point totals on a rolling point basis.
