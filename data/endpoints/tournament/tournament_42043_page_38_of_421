That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in convertion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. I see two events listed, are they fenced as separate tournaments?\r\nA. No.  This is one combined event and is only separated out to allow everybody to register for the event.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 21 fencers.

If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nPre-registered fencers - if you are unable to attend, PLEASE delete your registration so that others can sign up.

Turn left at this light and immediately turn right onto Hwy. 41 North (turn right before going under the bridge) After about 2 miles (after the traffic light,) turn right to exit onto Hwy. 411 South\/Hwy. 20 West.\r\n\r\nAfter about 18 miles and 4 traffic lights, get in the right lane and take the middle exit ramp (the sign above the ramp says \"Rome\") This road turns into Turner McCall Blvd as it goes into town.\r\n\r\nStay on Turner McCall Blvd. for about 3.5 miles. At this point (at the intersection of Horseleg Creek Rd,) the road changes names to Shorter Ave.\r\n\r\nLess than 1\/4 mile from the intersection at Horseleg Creek Rd, turn left at the traffic light onto Sherwood Rd.

Go over I-59 and take Highway 117 through Hammondville and Mentone and into Georgia. After you reach Cloudland, GA, take Highway 48 to Summerville. From Summerville, take Highway 27 South, which goes into Rome.\r\n \r\nAfter you pass the traffic light at Mount Berry Square Mall and the one at Berry College, Highway 20 will turn into Martha Berry Blvd. Stay on Martha Berry Blvd. until you get to Turner McCall Blvd (Wallgreens will be on your right.) Turn right, and go through two traffic lights. Less that 1\/4 mile after the 3rd light (Horseleg Creek Rd,) turn left onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign here also says \u0093Shorter College.\u0094 After turning, take an immediate left, and go through the security gate.\r\n\r\nThe road will fork shortly after the security gate.

The Winthrop-King Center will be on your left, downhill from the parking lot.  \r\n\r\n________________________________________\r\nComing From Birmingham \r\nTake I-59 to Gadsden (via I-759) After I-759 ends, take Highway 411 North\/East to Centre. From Centre, take Highway 20 East into Rome. Highway 20 turns into Shorter Ave. Take Shorter Ave. through town. After you pass Sams Club and Wal Mart (on your left,) keep going for a little over two miles. Take a right at a traffic light onto Sherwood Rd. The street sign at here also says \u0093Shorter College.\u0094 (Buffalo\u0092s Restaurant will be on the left shortly before you turn.)

It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Mixed epee.  If the Y14 fencers (and parents) have not had enough when the Y14 event is over we may have a Mixed Random Draw Y14 team Epee event also.   If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your Mixed or Y14 event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from mixed and Y14 and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  It's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nThis event is jointly presented by the Brazosport Fencing Extravaganza and the Galveston Fencing Club.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gulfcoastfencing.org\/GCwaiverconsent.pdf\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it\u0092s about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.  After you cross the railroad tracks look for the college on the left.  We\u0092ll have some signs up to guide you to the gym.  Depending on where in Houston you\u0092re coming from it\u0092s about an hour drive.  \r\n\r\nMap:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/tinyurl.com\/bcfal\r\n\r\nIf you get lost call me on my cell - 979 848 7433\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brazosport College, Lake Jackson TX","address":"","city":"Lake Jackson","state":"TX","zip":"","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":29.0338575,"longitude":-95.4343859,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":21778,"tournament_id":4777,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Div2 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-11-24T12:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":21780,"tournament_id":4777,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-11-24T10:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":21784,"tournament_id":4777,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed Random Draw Team Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":99,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Random Draw Team","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":21785,"tournament_id":4777,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed  Random Draw Team Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":99,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":" Random Draw Team","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4022,"name":"NEUSFA, Turkey Open, 3 Weapon Mixed, @ BFC","start_date":"2007-11-24","end_date":"","comments":"New England Turkey Open.\r\nMixed Epee, Foil, and Sabre.\r\n\r\nPre-registration requested but not required; $10 at the door. $5 refundable cleanup deposit required.","prereg_open":"2007-08-10","prereg_close":"2007-11-24","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Boston Fencing Club","address":"110-2 Clematis Ave","city":"Waltham","state":"MA","zip":"","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":42.383523,"longitude":-71.203595,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":18805,"tournament_id":4022,"tournament":"NEUSFA, Turkey Open, 3 Weapon Mixed, @ BFC","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-11-24T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":18806,"tournament_id":4022,"tournament":"NEUSFA, Turkey Open, 3 Weapon Mixed, @ BFC","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-11-24T13:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":18807,"tournament_id":4022,"tournament":"NEUSFA, Turkey Open, 3 Weapon Mixed, @ BFC","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-11-24T14:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4811,"name":"NGFC Touche Turkey Fest","start_date":"2007-11-24","end_date":"","comments":"Come work off your thanksgiving feast at the NGFC Touche Turkey Fest Veterans Mixed Open Foil\/Epee & E & Under Mixed Foil\/Epee.
