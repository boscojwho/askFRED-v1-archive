You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector and fencing pants. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nNew for this season: All foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2000-2003\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1998-2001\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=19693\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/05\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82488,"tournament_id":20009,"tournament":"FAP Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-10-07T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19506,"name":"BCAF 14th Annual  Flynn Epee Memorial Tourny","start_date":"2012-10-07","end_date":"","comments":"THE FLYNN IS BACK & this year FENCERS EAT FREE! *PLEASE READ THE MORE INFO SECTION Medals\/prizes\/great food!

Also, since the Y10 and Y12 fencers in the area have fewer opportunities for tournaments and practice, we invite all youth fencers from any club with current national points for foil in the Y10 and Y12 age groups to join us.\r\n\r\n------------------ Important Info ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: MTFC Sharks and Minnows\r\nDate: 10\/7\/2012\r\nClose of Registration: 11 AM\r\nLocation: Metro Tacoma Fencing Club, Tacoma, WA\r\n\r\nWe are physically located at 1106 South 15th Street, Tacoma, WA 98405 in the Sons of Norway building called \"Normanna Hall\" at the corner of 15th and Martin Luther King. Entrance is on the 15th Street side of the building. Look for the neon crossed swords sign in the window.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 11 AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $5 for the event.\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT RENTAL: $10 if you need to rent equipment.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nAt least a non-competitive US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is necessary to participate due to liability requirements. These events are not rated, and you cannot get a classification change from this event. A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we will show you if needed). \r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to arrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you will need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through an electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nThis is a sharks and minnows foil event. We will conduct our tournament with an initial round of pools as is standard for USFA tournaments. There will be a second round of pools to follow with a separate \"sharks\" group for the top 6-8 fencers (after the first round of pools) who will be protected to advance to the direct elimination round. All the \"minnows\" will be sorted based on their first round pool performance for their second round of pools with other minnows. Direct eliminations will follow based on the second round of pools (the sharks have a guaranteed spot) adding some of the the top seeded fencers in the minnows group after the second round of pools. Not everyone will advance to direct eliminations though this format will allow two rounds of pools with the second round more equal in fencing strength which is more and better fencing for everyone.\r\n\r\nIf we have 24 or fewer fencers, the top 16 fencers will advance to the direct elimination table, with 28 fencers the top 12 will advance, with 32 fencers we will skip the direct eliminations since we will fence pools of 8. Depending on the number of participants we may need to fence pools in two flights though we will try to avoid this by having pools of up to 8 fencers. Either way, there will be plenty of fencing for all participants.\r\n\r\nThe rounds will be self-directed.
