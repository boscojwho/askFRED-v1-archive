If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70500,"tournament_id":16662,"tournament":"Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":22,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-01-29T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17178,"name":"Division II\/III Summer Natl.

No one will be allowed to fence without a signed waiver form.\r\n\r\nWaiver Form .PDF --> http:\/\/askfred.net\/Committee\/Downloads\/fileDL.php?file_id=499\r\n\r\nNew USA Fencing memberships and new or replacement USFA cards should be obtained through the USA Fencing website before the tournament.\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\r\n\r\nAthletes arriving without proof of USA Fencing membership must fill out all appropriate forms and pay for membership at registration even if already a member.

Equipment check will test the mask, lame jacket, gloves and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\" All events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: Underarm plastron, 2nd weapon and body cord, weapon check control marks.  Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 2-3pm on Friday and between 7-8am on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly.  Those fencing Saturday or Sunday can have their equipment checked Friday anytime after 5 pm.\r\n\r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nNote that Absolute Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order. \r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\n\r\nSeeding is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking within year classification. Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Clash will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. You can check your USA Fencing rating by downloading and searching for your name here -- http:\/\/usfencing.org\/us-fencing-membership\/current-membership-listing. You can check your points here -- http:\/\/usfencing.org\/national-points-standings\/current-national-points\r\n\r\nThis information will be obtained from USA Fencing on Thursday, February 2. Any discrepancies regarding classifications or points earned must be resolved by this date.\r\n\r\nEach event's tentative seeding will be posted at the venue prior to the close of check-in. It will also be posted at http:\/\/live.nffdc.org.\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION INFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS\r\n\r\nFailure to report to a strip timely for the start of a bout subjects the fencer to disqualification according to USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nNo flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions.

Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73941,"tournament_id":17572,"tournament":"Y10 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-04T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16551,"name":"FIORETTO Open Foil ---)---------------","start_date":"2012-02-04","end_date":"","comments":"Please join us for an Open Foil  Event at FIORETTO Fencing Academy!

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":73956,"tournament_id":17588,"tournament":"Div. 3 Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-02-05T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":17634,"name":"Super Sword Sunday Epee & Sabre Open @ Medeo","start_date":"2012-02-05","end_date":"","comments":"Get your game on before the big game.
