After that date you can still register, but will need to\r\ncall me at 530-343-2773 before Friday night at 10pm, bring a check or cash to the event and pay a $20 late fee for processing.\r\n\r\nThose that have come to SNO before know that we are committed to an\r\non-time, fun event. Our all USFA-rated referees this year are: Tomek\r\nAmborski, Robby Carrillo, Kristyan and Tsvetelina Hristov, Larry\r\nDunn, Eric Ricketts, John Springgate, Eric Momberg and myself, Kathy\r\nSchifferle. \r\n\r\nOur new venue is big and comfortable - we have onsite food and\r\nbeverage, plus you are within waling distance of downtown Chico -\r\nwhere the annual music festival will be going on all day!\r\n\r\nCurrently there are over 20 people that are only pre-registered, so no one can see them - please finish your registration soon so that everyone can see the actual totals that will be attending - and the rest of you gather more friends and join the fun. I have attached a poster in case you want to share it.\r\n\r\nDon't forget the Saturday Night gala at the Sierra Nevada Brewery,\r\nwhere last year's gold medalist from Open Foil, Open Saber, Veteran\r\nEpee and Women's Epee will duel this year's gold medalist for exotic\r\nand beautiful prizes (plus food, drink and fun)\r\n\r\nChico loves fencing - fencers should expect to see the\r\nnews media at the tournament, as well as local spectators.\r\n\r\nSee you soon...\r\n\r\nAny questions - call or email anytime.\r\n\r\nKathy Schifferle\r\nNorth Coast Division
