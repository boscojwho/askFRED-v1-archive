Teams of 3 or 4 people limited to 6 teams. \r\n\r\nFencers must create teams of 3 fencers, they may optionally include 1 alternate.\r\n\r\nFor pools fencers assign their strongest fencer to their A spot, their mid fencer to their B spot, and their weakest to their C spot. \r\n\r\nAll A spot fencers fence in a pool, B slot fencers in a pool, and C slot fencers in a pool.

Example, Team 1 versus Team 4, each fencer fences a five touch bout against each fencer on the other team. The first team to win 5 bouts wins and advances to the next round. \r\n\r\nIf an alternate is present the alternate must be subbed in permanently in the pool round. No fencer may fence in more than one slot (A,B,C). \r\n\r\nSubstitutions may be in and out in the DE round so long as no fencer fences the same person twice. Substitutions must be announced at least one bout before the bout where the substitution will occur.\r\n\r\nDuring DEs each team is allowed 1 time out of 30 seconds per bout.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

The winner of each DYCS, regardless of size of field, will earn 100 points. The size of the participant field is based on all athletes in the event. RYC. At least 5 fencers must compete in a given DCS event for points to be awarded.\r\n\r\nExample: \r\nFencer places 6th out of a field of 14 fencers = 64 points\r\n(14-6+1)\/14 x 100\r\n9\/14 x 100\r\n.64 x 100\r\n64 \r\n\r\nFencer places 6th out of a field of 8 fencers = 38 points\r\n(8-6+1)\/8 x 100\r\n3\/8 x 100\r\n38 x 100\r\n38\r\n\r\nFencers may fence in multiple events as long as the events do not overlap.
