If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\n2015-16 PAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\nDue to the need to accurately hire referees, we are sorry, but there can be no refunds for prepayments.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228766,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":135453,"tournament_id":34272,"tournament":"Liberty Open, Veteran, and Team Saber","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-11-13T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":35045,"name":"Infinity: Senior Battle of the U's and Youth","start_date":"2016-11-13","end_date":"","comments":"Senior U only event -- earn your \"E\" rating if enough fencers sing up!

Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau.

If you do not have a current membership at check-in, you will be required to sign up on the day of the tournament. Your USA Fencing membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you. Temporary paper membership cards can be printed  using the link above. \r\n\r\n<b>WAIVER<\/b> must be filled out and brought when checking in.\r\nThose whose membership card does not indicate that their birth year has been verified by USA Fencing will also have to show a birth certificate, passport or other government issued ID at registration.

Please verify that your rating and points standing are correct with USA Fencing and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing Current points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n\r\n1.  Current national Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC\r\n2.  Letter Ranking with year classification.\r\n3.  Athletes with neither of the above are seeded in a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event (i.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc). \r\n\r\n<b>FORMAT<\/b>\r\nAll events will have one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. There is no fence-off for third place.\r\n\r\n<b>UNIFORM REQUIREMENTS<\/b>\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Conductive foil bibs are required. Elastic strap at the back of the mask is required. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. 800N SABER GLOVES ARE MANDATORY FOR ALL USA FENCING SANCTIONED TOURNAMENTS STARTING OCTOBER 1st, 2015.\r\n\r\nThe Armoury Equipment Check will test the mask, glove, lame, sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords. Items that have passed inspection will be specifically marked. Directors will be checking for these marks prior to the start of fencing. Full Armory Equipment Check is required for all competitors, with no exceptions. Fencers only need to have their equipment passed once for the duration of the SYC.\r\n\r\nFor Y10 events, a 30\u0094 or 32\u0094 blade is required. For Y12, Y14, and Cadet events standard blade length of 30-35\u0094 is permitted.

If USFA membership is not shown in the current USFA database, an e-mail or FAX from USFA will be needed confirming status of:\r\n\u0095\tCurrent competitive membership in the Ark-La-Miss Division\r\n\u0095\tCitizenship status\r\n\u0095\tPrimary club\r\n\u0095\tDate of birth\r\n\u0095\tSex \r\nIf that is not provided, a new membership form and payment will be required (membership forms for minors require the signature of a parent or legal guardian, the coach may not sign, except of course for his own child.). Be prepared to show birth certificate if you are acquiring a new membership.\r\n\r\nReceipts from clubs or other tournaments are not acceptable, as these membership forms may not have been submitted. \r\n\r\nMembership forms will be available at the venue but it is preferred that the form be downloaded, printed and completed prior to check-in. Form is located here:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/699332-forms\r\n\r\nPayment for individual memberships is made directly to the USFA either by credit card (preferred) or check. USFA Membership can also be purchased online (https:\/\/www.railstation.org\/usfencing\/MembershipRegistration.aspx). \r\n\r\nPlease bring separate check (or cash) for tournament fees.\r\n\r\nAll participants should download the WAIVER OF LIABILITY and CONSENT FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT FORM from the Division website (http:\/\/almdiv.org\/Operations\/WAIVERS\/waiverconsent.pdf) or obtain a copy from their coach. Have a parent or guardian sign the form, and bring the signed form to check- in the tournament. NO ONE MAY FENCE WITHOUT THESE DOCUMENTS.\r\n\r\nParticipants are required to fence in proper fencing attire; current USFA rules will apply. (This includes the latest added area to the foil mask bib, correct placement of the lame tab for mask to lame cord, and gloves that have the proper closure near the wrist.)\r\n\r\nNew 2016-2017 saber rules changes (enguard lines and new timing on electrical machines) will be enforced during these events.\r\n\r\nJunior Olympics is a NATIONAL championship; the qualifying path to the Junior Olympics requires participants to be either U.S. citizens or permanent residents. USFA provides the division secretary with this information. If you have not received your USFA membership card and apply for the card at the competition, please be prepared to show verification of citizenship status. \r\n\r\nCadet events will not be rated unless they meet or exceed the criteria for a C1 event. Junior events will be rated according to latest classification chart. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Caddo Magnet High School Gymnasium","address":"1601 Viking

Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at:http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents in these events. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.
