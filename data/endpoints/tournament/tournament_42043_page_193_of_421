All events will be fenced electronically.  There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.  \r\n\r\nThese tournaments are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Southwest Youth Series and the Regional Youth Circuit.  They are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment.  They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES.  Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome!  We will provide lunch for anyone refereeing multiple events.

The fencer\u0092s signature on the pool sheet or DE slip implies accuracy and acceptance. \r\n\r\nSeeding: \r\nSeeding is based initially on the fencers Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then their letter ranking with the year of classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. \r\nOnly ratings and points standings listed on the USFA website will be used. Check your rating at http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx and national point standing at http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Athlete-Info.aspx\r\n\r\nEach event consists of two rounds (pools and direct elimination)\r\nPools: One preliminary round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round.\r\nDirect Elimination Tableau shall be generated from the results of the preliminary pool round.\r\nY 10 DE format - Y10 direct elimination bouts will be for 10 touches or will end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 touches are scored, whichever comes first.  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nY 12 & Y14 DE format - direct elimination bouts will be for 15 touches or will end when 3 periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period have passed.  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nMedals will be awarded to the Top 8 Fencers in all Y-8 events and to the Top 3 Fencers in the Y-10, Y12, & Y 14 events. There are no fence-offs for third place.\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events do not use the E1 or D1 classifications. This means that these events are not rated until they achieve the C1 level or higher. See the USFA ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\nPhotography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: A fencer who withdraws or who is excluded is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not competed.\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When, for whatever reason, a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout his opponent will be declared the winner of that bout.  A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\n50-58 Burnett Avenue, Maplewood, NJ (use 54 Burnett Avenue for MapQuest).

The top 8 of finishers in the senior events will qualify for Division I-A at Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nVeteran fencers that compete in the senior events will automatically qualify for the corresponding veteran event at Summer Nationals.

If an event exceeds 80 fencers, it may be necessary to do a cut after the pool round. This will be announced after the registration deadline, once the number of attendees is known. \r\n\r\nPrizes will be awarded to the top 4 finishers in the senior and veteran events.

How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94045,"tournament_id":23329,"tournament":"FAP  Cadet\/Adult Novice  NON-ELECTRIC Foil ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-19T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":23591,"name":"fiore dei liberi epee tournament","start_date":"2013-10-19","end_date":"","comments":"$10 pre-registered & paid thru ASKFRED;\r\n$15 if walk-in; credit cards accepted. \r\npackage: $40 for our next 8 saturday afternoon tournaments.\r\nepee rental: $1;\r\nbodycord rental: $1.

This will give our young fencers the practice needed for National events where they must always have their equipment checked before the start of their event. We will be checking masks, lames, sabre cuffs, body cords and mask leads.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The new US Fencing rule change for the Y10 and Y12 DE Format will be as follows:\r\n\r\n1) Y10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 hits or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first.\r\n\r\n2) Y12 direct elimination bouts are for 15 hits or end when 3 periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period have passed.\r\n\r\nAll events in the SDFC RYC are also designated San Diego Division Cup events. Points accumulated will go towards the SD Div Cup for each age group.
