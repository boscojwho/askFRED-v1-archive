For your convenience, you can pay your USFA dues at the competition (or ahead of time at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org).\r\n\r\n<b>Entry Fee:<\/b> $15 at the door, $25 if both the Oct 13 and Dec 1 event are entered. \r\n\r\nThe New England Fencing Alliance will donate all entry fees to \u0093<b>Strides Against Breast Cancer\/ACS<\/b>\u0094.\r\n\r\nWith regard to registration for the events, in order to encourage contributions and to comply with charitable giving rules, <b>we will waive entry fees for participants who make a contribution to \u0093Strides Against Breast Cancer\/ACS\u0094 in lieu of entry fees.<\/b> This will enable participants to avail themselves of the tax advantages that accompany the contribution. \r\n\r\n\r\nNEFA will provide a light breakfast of bagels cereal, juice, coffee and tea to the competitors and volunteers. Spectators who make a donation (any amount) to the American Cancer Society will be able to partake in this light breakfast. In addition, we will be supplying bottled water, bottled Gatorade and snacks throughout the day.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intent of these competitions is to provide a venue for adult women to fence, socialize with their peers, and to raise money to fund lifesaving research and support programs related to breast cancer. Furthermore, these competitions will provide an opportunity for the sport of fencing to distinguish itself in promoting the health of fencers and all women by participating in an event that is 100% dedicated to charity. In this regard, as the demographics of recreational\/competitive fencing evolve and change, so have the opportunities for fencing to grow and to contribute to society in this positive manner and example. Not only will women have an opportunity to fence in an adult women's event, but any and all monies raised for entry fees, as well as all other revenue generated by the event, will be donated to the American Cancer Society in furtherance of their annual Making Strides Against Breast Cancer event. \r\n\r\nAnnually, October is deemed \"Breast Cancer Awareness Month\" and our companion charity, the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer Walk, is a multi-state coordinated event that takes place on the following day, October 14th, in Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Connecticut, and parts of New Jersey as well as in about 25 other states across the USA. Several competitors and volunteers plan to continue their support by participating in the Sunday walk as a follow-up to Saturday fencing. The Making Strides against Breast Cancer campaign is one of the American Cancer Society's premier events to raise awareness and dollars to fight this devastating disease. We, again, have committed to donate all of the proceeds to the same charity at the December 1 competition which also will serve, for some fencers, as a warm-up for the Women's Veteran's North American Cup scheduled for the following weekend in Richmond, VA. \r\n\r\nAgain, the purpose of the event is to provide a unique forum for adult women, who have asked for a targeted competition that will provide a means for them to fence competitively, develop camaraderie with their peers, and to support the work of the American Cancer Society in its efforts to develop a cure for breast cancer. The administration of the event is organized and staffed by volunteers who, by way of word of mouth, have heard about the competition. Veteran competitors, former Olympians, nationally ranked referees, and other notables from the fencing community, have expressed an outpouring of interest in volunteering. Again, this event will be completely non-profit and dedicated to participating in finding a cure to one of the most frequently diagnosed and dreaded diseases that has affected millions of people. We are in the process of arranging for event fees to be paid directly to the charity or at the door for donation following the event.\r\n\r\nI would encourage everyone who is not familiar with the American Cancer Society's \"Strides Against Breast Cancer\" and their work to visit their website at \r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/makingstrides.acsevents.org\/site\/TR\/MakingStridesAgainstBreastCancer\/MSABCFY08NewEngland?pg=entry&fr_id=3496\r\n\r\nMichael Tarascio\r\nNew England Fencing Alliance\r\nmailto:events@nefencing.com\r\n\r\nMore info at http:\/\/www.fencing1.com\/\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/10\/2007.\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/1\/2007.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Gibbs School","address":"41 Foster Street","city":"Arlington","state":"MA","zip":"02474","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":42.410508,"longitude":-71.145641,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":42,"name":"New England","abbrev":"NENG","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":18781,"tournament_id":4016,"tournament":"NEUSFA & NEFA, Benefit for American Cancer Society","full_name":"Senior Women's 30+ Foil","short_name":"SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"30+","close_of_reg":"2007-12-01T10:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":4787,"name":"December Demolition Derby","start_date":"2007-12-01","end_date":"2007-12-02","comments":"Eggnog welcome...","prereg_open":"2007-10-30","prereg_close":"2007-11-30","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Augusta Fencers Club","address":"134 Ninth St","city":"Augusta","state":"GA","zip":"30901","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":33.476547,"longitude":-81.967029,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":57,"name":"Georgia","abbrev":"GA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":21839,"tournament_id":4787,"tournament":"December Demolition Derby","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-12-01T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":21841,"tournament_id":4787,"tournament":"December Demolition Derby","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-12-02T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":21842,"tournament_id":4787,"tournament":"December Demolition Derby","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-12-02T13:45:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":4790,"name":"MN Division Referee Workshop","start_date":"2007-12-01","end_date":"","comments":"A workshop for honing your refereeing skills, running from 3 - 6 pm.\r\n\r\nPlease sign up for the weapon you are most interested in working on.","prereg_open":"2007-10-30","prereg_close":"2007-11-28","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"The workshop will include practical demonstrations of fencing actions from the simple to the complex.

Five clubs are allowed to qualify without fencing, therefore, if less than 6 clubs pre-register, all qualify and no fencing will occur.  To help defray tournament expenses, no trophies will be given to non-contested events.  Team events are seeded according fencer classification of the same weapon.   No division patches are given for team events, but will be awarded for non-contested individual events.  For further information, please check the complete rules for qualifiers in the electronic news sent to each USFA member or the confirmation materials included with registration for national events, or contact the division secretary.\r\n\r\nTeam captains who wish to qualify their team must check-in with the names of their team members at the appropriate times.  For Saturday's events, check is is by 10 a.m. Saturday (for Saturday's events.)  For Sunday's events, check-in closes at 3 p.m. on Saturday for Sunday's events.  If the captain does not check-in with the names of the team at or before the correct time, the team will forfeit.  If less than 6 teams pre-register by the deadline (November 30) the events will not be fenced, but team captains still must submit team members. \r\n\r\nTHERE ARE NO COMBINED TEAMS...

ABSOLUTELY READ THESE FOUR BULLETS BEFORE REGISTERING !!!<\/div>\r\n<ul><li>You absolutely, positively, must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in these qualifying events. You should bring your USFA card to the event with you just in case (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing). If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively, will not let you compete. Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter. Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers. If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\n<li>You must both register and complete online payment to be registered for any of these events. After you complete both, confirm that your name appears under the correct events in the \"Whose Pre-registered\" list in AskFRED. On-site registration for those who didn't register or complete online payment will include an additional $10 late registration fee PER EVENT.<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\n<li>You must show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration. BE THERE and BE ON TIME.<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\n<li>If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com). As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse. We will be highly unsympathetic towards any excuses short of natural disaster, war and\/or death (and for those at war, you technically belong to the National Division, so even that won't work!).<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<b>QUESTIONS<\/b>\r\nEmail us at nyacfencing@yahoo.com\r\n<\/div>","venue":{"name":"New York Athletic Club","address":"180 Central Park South","city":"New York","state":"NY","zip":"10019","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.766523,"longitude":-73.978602,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":24,"name":"Metropolitan NYC","abbrev":"METRO","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":18989,"tournament_id":4072,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Men's Epee","short_name":"JrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-12-02T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":18990,"tournament_id":4072,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Junior Women's Epee","short_name":"JrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-12-02T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":18991,"tournament_id":4072,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Men's Epee","short_name":"CdME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":10,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-12-02T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":18992,"tournament_id":4072,"tournament":"Metropolitan Division JO Epee Qualifiers","full_name":"Cadet Women's Epee","short_name":"CdWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Cadet","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2007-12-02T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":4840,"name":"Socal Divison Junior Olympic Epee Qualifiers   ","start_date":"2007-12-02","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2007-11-10","prereg_close":"2007-12-01","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":12,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Sunday, Dec. 2, 2007\r\n\r\nChaminade High School\r\n7500 Chaminade Ave\r\nCanoga Park, CA 91304\r\n\r\n 8:30 AM     Junior Women's Epee\r\n10:30 AM     Junior Men's Epee\r\n12:30 PM     Cadet Women\u0092s Epee\r\n 1:30 PM     Cadet Men's Epee\r\n\r\nThe event fee is $12.00 if you pre-register and pay on AskFred.net by Nov.30.\r\nThis fee is non refundable.\r\n\r\nPlease pre-register on-line.

It is not a sanctioned event and participants do not have to be USFA members. (Although they may join the USFA at the tournament if they wish.) \r\n\r\nThe bout committee will make an effort to categorize fencers by size rather than by sex or age.\r\n\r\nPlease arrive at the venue no later than 10:00 AM.

If you are not in the database and do not have your USFA card with you when checking in, you will be required to complete a new USFA form and pay the annual fee. The form and payment will be returned to you upon proof of USFA membership subsequent to the tournament. We will be enforcing the USFA age rules for the Open event. Fencers whose birth year is after 1994 will not be permitted to fence in the Open (or Veteran)event.\r\n\r\n\r\n______________________________________________\r\nTOURNAMENT SERVICES:\r\n\r\nMASK & WEAPONS CHECKS: All masks must be punch tested and stamped before competing.
