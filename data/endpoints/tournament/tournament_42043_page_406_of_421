See other dates below.\r\n\r\nLast season\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Cup produced four A2-rated Vet Mixed Saber events, 12 A\/B ratings, 10 C\/D\/E ratings and saw the participation of 64 unique fencers across five events. These are among the largest Vet Saber events in the country outside of the Veteran NACs. In addition to East Coast fencers, competitors have included attendees from as far away as Atlanta and Chicago.\r\n\r\nCOVID protocols for Cup events will be at least as strict as the protocols for the Vet NACs in effect at the time of the Cup event. More information may be provided closer to the event at the discretion of the Club.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW WILL THE CUP WINNER DETERMINED?\r\n\r\nIn addition to individual event awards, the Top 3 MS and the Top 3 WS fencers in the 2022-2023 Cup Standings at the end of the season will be recognized. \r\n\r\n2022-2023 Cup Standings will be determined as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Each fencer will get credit for points earned in their three best finishes (as measured by points) at 2022-2023 Cup events\r\n\r\n2. For each 2022-2023 Cup event, fencers will receive points based on their finish and letter ratings of other participants who finish below them:\r\na. Each fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)\r\nb. Fencers will earn points equal to the sum of the point values of all fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points\r\nc. In the case of Vet Mixed Sabre, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) below them\r\n\r\n3. Ties in the Cup Standings will be resolved in favor of the fencer that received the higher number of points at a single Cup event\r\n\r\n\r\n2022-2023 CUP EVENTS (LIST IN DEVELOPMENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 17, 2022)\r\n\r\nSeptember 11, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Atlantic Fencing Academy (NJ)\r\nOctober \/ November \u00e2\u0080\u0093 (to be confirmed)\r\nDecember 4, 2022 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Capital Fencing Academy (MD)\r\nFebruary 5, 2023 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Manhattan Fencing Center (NY)\r\nMarch \/ April 2023 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 (to be confirmed)\r\nJune 11, 2023 \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Infinity Fencing Alliance (NJ)\r\n","venue":{"name":"Capital Fencing Academy","address":"12180 Nebel St","city":"North Bethesda","state":"MD","zip":"20852","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.0515043,"longitude":-77.1104567,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":25,"name":"Capitol","abbrev":"CAP","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":201066,"tournament_id":51640,"tournament":"Capital Fencing - Tri-State Veteran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Saber Cup","full_name":"VetCombined Women's Saber","short_name":"VCmWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":16,"prereg_count":16,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-12-04T11:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":201067,"tournament_id":51640,"tournament":"Capital Fencing - Tri-State Veteran\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Saber Cup","full_name":"VetCombined Mixed Saber","short_name":"VCmMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"VetCombined","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":25,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-12-04T13:30:00-05:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":52153,"name":"Junior Olympic Qualifiers","start_date":"2022-12-04","end_date":"","comments":"Qualifying Events for Junior Olympics.

The objective is to provide youth (y8, y10, y12 and y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in y8, y10, y12 and\/or y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of escrimeur youth cup points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCalculations\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of points (mxpnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge group     mxpnts\r\n  y8\t       50\r\n  y10\t       50\r\n  y12\t      100\r\n  y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of evntxratio:\r\n\r\nEvntxratio = nentrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((nentrs - pl + 1) \/ nentrs) x mxpnts x evntxratio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned points for escrimeur youth cup series will be a sum of all points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net by midnight on sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net starting monday through midnight on saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks, venmo or zelle for payments made at the door.
