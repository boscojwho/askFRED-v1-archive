To expedite the registration process, it is HIGHLY recommended that you obtain it prior to the tournament. \r\nWe cannot guarantee use of a computer for renewal. You may renew on your smartphone or other personal device prior to presenting at registration.\r\nYou need a current USFA membership to preregister on AskFred.\r\n\r\nThe bout committee reserves the option of combining the men's and women's veteran events into mixed events if there are fewer than 6 competitors in one of the single-sex events. If an event is mixed, men and women will still medal separately. \r\n  \r\nUSFA conductive bib rules for foil will be enforced. Rules concerning the conductive bib on the foil mask can be found in the current USFA rulebook t.471.2\r\n\r\nUSFA competitions must strictly enforce the epee wiring rules. Wires may no longer be threaded through the channel in the socket. See http:\/\/www.fencingofficials.org\/blog\/2013\/05\/wiring-epees\/\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n*Transparent masks are NOT permitted in any weapon.\r\n*Masks with exchangeable bibs are allowed. If the inspection mark is placed on the bib, be sure not to change out your inspection mark!\r\n*Anyone participating in a foil or sabre event will need 2 mask cords.\r\n*All gloves will be checked by the armorer for integrity of material. No tears or holes will be permited\r\n(except for those that allow for the body cord).\r\n*For safety and insurance purposes, fencers and coaches must wear mask and glove while participating in drills, lessons, warm-up, with weapon in hand. Failure to comply may result in removal from the venue.\r\n\r\n2015-16 USFA Age Classifications:\r\n\u0095 Youth-14: 2001-2004\r\n\u0095 Junior (U-20): 1996-2002\r\n\u0095 Senior: 2002 or earlier\r\n\u0095 Veteran: 1976 or earlier\r\n\r\n\r\nKSG charges an admission fee for spectators (anyone not competing, officiating or volunteering).

Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/5\/15.

Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/7\/15.

Details can be found in the Rulebook and Athlete Handbook at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695205-manuals\r\n\r\nOn-line tournament results:  Live real-time posting of seeding, pool and strip assignments and results.  Live tournament feed:  http:\/\/    .com. (On Smartphones with BFC free Wi-Fi ).  Note: prior to tournament any posted seeding is preliminary and NOT official.\r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\nSeeding is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter rankings, then by classification year.  Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves. http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0059\/5402\/Regional_Recognition_Initiative_Information_Document_2015-2016_-3.9.15.pdf\r\n\r\nRYC will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USFA in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by organizers from USFA.  This information will be downloaded on Wednesday, August 12, 2015.  Check your current points at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings.   Fencers should verify their ratings prior to the event.  Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USA Fencing.  Only an official e-mail response from USA Fencing will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the bout committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted.  \r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS\r\nSAFETY AND EQUIPMENT POLICY\r\nRYC events are run in accordance with USFA rules and formats.  \r\n\r\nFull fencing uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron, fencing knickers, knee length socks and glove.  Additionally, chest protectors are required for girls.  All USFA uniform requirements apply.  Conductive bibs are required for foil fencers.\r\n\r\nEach fencer is required to have two working electric weapons, and two working body cords.  Foil and saber fencers need two working mask cords and saber fencers must have over-glove conductive sleeves.  \r\n\r\nALL Y10 fencers will be required to use size \u00930\u0094 or size \u00932\u0094 blades (less than 32.5 inches long).  Blades labeled as \u00930\u0094 or \u00932\u0094 but are longer than 32.5 inches are not permitted.\r\n\r\nNames on uniforms are not required for RYC tournaments.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT CHECKS\r\nDuring the initial equipment inspection at check in, lames, masks, gloves, saber overgloves, body and mask cords, as well as any French grip weapons will be tested and marked (Stamp on mask, colored tape or other mark on cords) to show they pass inspection. \r\n\r\nMasks that do not pass the 12 kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is NOT APPROVED FOR USE.  \r\n\r\nEquipment (using weights and shims) and uniforms will be inspected upon reporting to the strip for the pool round and each direct elimination bout to ensure the presence of underarm plastron, second weapon and cords, and weapon control marks.  \r\n\r\nFailure to appear when called and with approved regulation equipment will subject fencer to penalties as defined by USFA rules and regulations.\r\n\r\nNote that vendors and armorers may be available to repair equipment for a fee per basis if time permits; but it is the ultimate responsibility of the fencer to have all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment checks on Saturday and Sunday.  Please plan accordingly.  Equipment may be check on Friday evening anytime after 2:00 p.m.  \r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED\r\nSingle gender events may be combined if there are insufficient fencers within an age category.  There must be FEWER THAN 5 ENTRIES IN ONE GENDER for the event to be combined.  Fencers may only compete in one event per day (extraordinary exceptions require Bout Committee approval.)\r\n\r\nFRIDAY August 14, 2015\r\n(Fri @ 3 pm)\tY10 Women's Epee\r\n(Fri @ 3 pm)\tY10 Men's Epee\r\n(Fri @ 5 pm)\tY12 Women's Saber\r\n(Fri @ 5 pm)\tY12 Men's Saber\r\n\r\nSATURDAY August 15, 2015\r\n(Sat @ 9 am)\tY12 Men's Foil\r\n(Sat @ 11 am)\tY12 Women's Foil\r\n(Sat @ 12 pm)\tY14 Women's Epee\r\n(Sat @ 1 pm)     Y14 Men's Epee\r\n\r\nSUNDAY August 16, 2015\r\n(Sun @ 9 am)\t Y12 Men's Epee\r\n(Sun @ 9 am)\t Y14 Women's Foil\r\n(Sun @ 11 am)\t Y10 Women's Foil\r\n(Sun @ 11 am)\t Y10 Men's Foil\r\n(Sun @ 1 pm)\t Y12 Women's Epee\r\n(Sun @ 1 pm)\t Y14 Men's Foil\r\n(Sun @ 2 pm)\t Y10 Women's Saber\r\n(Sun @ 2 pm)\t Y10 Men's Saber\r\n(Sun @ 2pm)\t Y14 Women's Saber\r\n(Sun @ 2 pm)\t Y14 Men's Saber\r\n\r\nEvent schedule times may be changed depending on entries.  Rely on email communication.  \r\n\r\nIf there are six or fewer fencers in a gender specific competition and there is an opposite gender-specific competition in the same weapon on that day the two may be combined for one mixed competition.  For competitions that have more than six fencers in each gender specific competition, the competitions shall remain separate. \r\n\r\nNOTE THAT ALL TIMES POSTED REPRESENT THE CLOSE OF CHECK-IN for the event. If all fencers for an event have checked in early, that event may start early (given availability of strips, referees, and readiness of the fencers to begin.)\r\n\r\nFencing usually commences approximately 20 minutes after the close of check in.  Start times are subject to change- check ASKFred for details.  It is recommended that fencers arrive at least one hour prior to close of check-in times.  This should provide sufficient time to register and have equipment checked and be properly warmed up. If all fencers for an event have checked in early, the event may start early depending on the availability of strips, referees, and readiness of the fencers to begin.\r\n\r\nBALTIMORE FENCING CENTER New West Learning Center doors open at 8:00 a.m. or one hour prior to close of registration.\r\n\r\nFencers must check in each day they compete within the indicated hours of check-in. Fencers who fail to check in before the published close of check in time will be removed from the event, and there will be NO entry fee refunds issued.  \r\n\r\nAWARDS AND RECOGNITION\r\nAwards\r\nThere will be separate awards for the top 8 places if an event has 8+ fencers.  If an age event is combined because there are fewer than 5 entries of one gender, medals will be awarded without distinction based upon the gender of any fencer- only the final placement in the event. Come prepared with bio information including your top three best fencing results and information for your local newspaper(s).  \r\n\r\nAwards ceremonies will follow the National format.  All award winners report to the awards presentation area immediately after the gold medal final bout for the event, wearing club uniform (warm ups) or fencing whites.  (No shorts, flip flops, spandex, hats are permitted.)  Please use your best judgment as you represent your club and are showing respect to the sport and participants.\r\n\r\nRegional recognition: \r\nAll region 6 athletes shall earn Regional Points based on placement.  Larger fields will award more points for placement.  Please consult the Regional Recognition Initiative document at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources for details.\r\n\r\nSanctioned RYC tournaments serve as a qualifying path for Youth North American Cup and Summer National Championships.  Please refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook for information on Youth Qualifying paths. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook .\r\n\r\nClassification changes will be awarded according to USFA rules.  In applicable age groups, the competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification based on final results.

He was born in Grand Forks, ND on August 2, 1930. Selberg received his Maitre D'Armes from the Federation International D'Escrime in 1967. In addition to being a fencing master, Selberg was also an abstract, post-impressionist painter. He has a painting in the permanent collection at Minnesota State University Moorhead in Moorhead, MN, and also one at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. On the side of the McCormick building in downtown Fargo, ND is a restored version of his infamous sign painting of 'The Cowboy' that he painted originally in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey). Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas. Sign painter, cartoonist and artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952, where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine of Arts degrees from San Francisco State University. Selberg taught art in San Francisco and fell in love with fencing in the early 1950's. Fencing first took root in North Dakota in 1960, when Maestro Selberg moved from San Francisco, where he was the head coach at the San Francisco School of Fencing (run by John McDougall), back to Fargo, ND, where he then founded North Dakota's first fencing school, the Selberg Fencing Academy, which he operated there between 1960 and 1966. The Selberg Fencing Academy (SFA) was located originally at 54 1\/2 North 5th St. in Fargo, but was moved in 1965 to the Fargo Arena building in Island Park in Fargo. Selberg thought that fencing would do well in Fargo because of the long cold winters that forced people indoors for physical activity. Fencing competitions in Fargo during that time (including many dual matches between Minneapolis and Fargo) were held either at the SFA or at Moorhead State University, in their large gym. Between 1960 and 1966, the North Dakota division grew to become the 4th-largest fencing division in the country, and SFA fencers won three Midwest Championships, a Chicagoland Open Championship, and finished in the Top 10 at the U.S. National Championships in Women's Foil two years in a row. In 1966, Selberg returned to San Francisco where he then taught at the Halberstadt Fencer's Club, and began his 16-year career teaching fencing at the University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College). Known affectionately as Mr. Natural among fencers at the University of California at Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, Maestro Selberg was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, his creative ability, and his tremendous sense of humor. The fencing masters that taught Charles formed his most impressive fencing lineage: German-born Eric Funke, followed by American-born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian-born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on Charles\u0092 teaching. In 1970, he was a member of the only U.S. foil team to ever win a gold medal at the World Masters Championships. Named one of the 'Great Fencing Masters in History' by Amarillo College in Texas, Charles was the author of the renowned books 'Foil' (1976) and 'Revised Foil' (1993). After retiring from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1982, Selberg moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the Selberg Fencing Academy and created an extensive series of instructional fencing videos and DVDs (http:\/\/www.selbergfencing.com). Maestro Selberg taught that the greatest benefits that we get from fencing are health and recreation.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Southwest Youth Ice Arena","address":"4404 23 Avenue SW","city":"Fargo","state":"ND","zip":"58104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":46.8434388,"longitude":-96.8585279,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":35,"name":"Minnesota","abbrev":"MN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":118655,"tournament_id":30195,"tournament":"2015 Charles Selberg Memorial Open ","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-08-15T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":26872,"name":"NOFC Back to Work 3W Open","start_date":"2015-08-15","end_date":"","comments":"Doors open at 9am\r\n \r\nAll fencers must have USFA competitive membership  ALL USFA rules appl\r\n\r\nPrepaid is preregistered","prereg_open":"2014-07-31","prereg_close":"2015-08-21","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":false,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":20,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"All USA rules apply\r\nUSFA competitive membership required \r\nSaber will begin as soon as strips are available once Epee DE's start.\r\nWeapon fee's $20 per.  \r\n\r\nPre paid is pre registered\r\nAll fees double at the door.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"First Church","address":"5212 S.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/12\/15. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (cash or check only).\r\n\r\n***Cash is preferred & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n$55 at the door for late registrations (after 8\/12\/15) and walk-ins (cash or check only). \r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

This \u0093social\u0094 get-together will hopefully get me the feedback needed to help us move in that direction.\r\n\r\nThe club is once again a full USA Fencing membership club, using their insurance, etc.  We will be having numerous events including sanctioned tournaments open to all.\r\nWe will be open from 10AM to 4PM.\r\n\r\nThe new facility has 5 strips (currently) and has the latest \u0093tech\u0094 (sorry no wireless yet) with beautifully laid out strips, excellent lighting, bathrooms, observation gallery.\r\n\r\nWhile I do expect the majority of fencers to be foil fencers, I am also inviting any and all Epee and Saber fencers.  Since there will be less of you, I am setting 12 Noon as the designated time for epeeists and 1PM as the designated time for Saber.\r\n\r\nThis event is informal, but all USFA regulations and equipment rules will apply.\r\n\r\nThe cost is a $10.00 per person donation, payable at the door.\r\n\r\nThe two restaurants in the mall have offered plates of their food as appetizers and of course we will have beverages and coffee available.\r\n\r\nHere is a cut and paste from a letter to MSFA members about the new facility\r\n\r\nThe MSFA facility (NOT A MAILING ADDRESS) address is: 6814 W. Brown Deer Rd, Milwaukee WI 53223.\r\n\r\nThe new facility is in a single story strip mall called \u0093Plaza Plaza\u0094.  It has excellent parking in front and behind, in a well-lit lot.  The mall has 2 restaurants; Schlotzsky\u0092s Deli and the Jalisco Charcoal Grill Mexican restaurant.  Additionally, there are many restaurants on Brown Deer Road within \u00bd mile.\r\n\r\nFour blocks away is a Walmart for the majority of your shopping needs and 6 blocks west is a Menard\u0092s, which I\u0092ve heard has an entire section devoted to fencing ;)\r\nGone are the stairs, the special downtown events that snarl traffic and take our parking away.  The new, Well-lit, air-conditioned modern facility, is a noticeable improvement in every way.  Sadly, moving has meant some students are further away.  Happily, moving has made it closer for others.\r\n\r\nPlease pay attention to this:  Brown Deer Road is very heavily patrolled.  It is very rare when I am going to or from the club, not to see a least one vehicle pulled over for some infraction.  The speed limit on BDR changes at least three times coming from I-43.  There are many law enforcement agencies involved as Brown Deer Road goes through Bayside, River Hills, Brown Deer, Milwaukee and Menomonee Falls.  Let\u0092s get to the club safely and without donating to the local \u0093tax\u0094 base.  To be fair, it needs to be heavily patrolled as with 6 lanes it has the feel of an expressway.  There are a lot of people driving way too fast.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\nMixed Foil\r\nMixed Saber\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/04\/2015.\r\nPreregistration closes on 08\/15\/2015.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Milwaukee Sport Fencing Academy","address":"6814 W.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 8\/14\/15.
