Fencers may bring a small tripod to record their bouts or stream to an outside party but placement of the tripod may not be in any place that will cause a safety concern or hinder the running of the event.

The Division, venue,  tournament, etc. will not be responsible for any broken equipment. <\/ul>\r\n<ul>- No congregating or gathering in any doorways, hallways, or walkways.<\/ul>\r\n<ul>- Fencers to refrain from shouting or screaming after scoring a touch.<\/ul>\r\n<ul>- When you have finished fencing in your event, please gather up your belongings quickly and leave the building immediately.

If you are listed as an incomplete registrant on FRED\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list, you WILL be charged the walk-in event fee.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Format:<\/b>\r\n\r\nThese events will have one round of pools, with 100% promotion into a direct elimination table. Pools for Cadet events will fence, followed by pools for Junior Events. Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. *Please note that Women's epee is the one exception, during which Junior events will come first, followed by Cadet events!*\r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division. To become a member or renew your membership, please visit <a>http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx<\/a> Please note that all memberships expire on July 31st, so if you have not renewed since July 31st you are not a current member.

Your USFA membership card will be checked during check-in, so please make sure you have it with you!\r\n\r\nFencers must follow the age restrictions set forth by the USFA. These restrictions can be found on page 22 of the Athlete Handbook or here: <a>https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/age-classification-eligibility<\/a>\r\n\r\nThe Bout Committee must use the current rating information found on the USFA website for seeding purposes. Please verify that your rating is correct with the USFA and contact the National Office to resolve any discrepancies prior to the tournament. Current ratings can be verified here:  <a>https:\/\/member.usafencing.org\/search\/members<\/a>\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies BEFORE the close of check-in for the event. (I.e. wrong club, wrong rating, misspelled name, etc.) As this information is verified directly from the USFA, fencers should make sure their USFA profiles are up-to-date!\r\n\r\n<b>Uniform Requirements:<\/b>\r\n\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. This includes the mandatory use of knickers, long socks, and underarm protectors. Names are NOT required to be on the uniform. \r\n\r\nThe Armory Equipment Check will test the mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords.

Please be sure to register early, and let us know if you will not be able to attend after registering. Refunds will be available for Registration and Event fees prior to the close of regular registration. After the close of regular registration, Registration fees will no longer be refunded, just event fees. At the close of Late Registration, no refunds will be awarded.\r\nFencers need to arrive prior to the close of check in. Due to the pandemic and the necessity to start our events on time, we will not be able to hold an event for any fencer or allow late entries. Any fencer that has not checked in prior to the posted time of the close of check in will be disqualified from that event. \r\nRegistration will be through the AskFRED.net website and all funds will be collected at that time.\r\n\r\nSchedule\r\n\r\nThe schedule for the DYCS is subject to change. Scheduling for future events will be based on the turnout in previous events and early registration. The final schedule will be set AT LEAST 2 WEEKS BEFORE THE EVENT START DATE. We will also email all effected participants with any schedule changes, so please be sure that an updated and accurate email address is attached to your AskFRED profile.\r\n\r\nEquipment Check:\r\nAt each event, please be prepared to present the following equipment at equipment check for inspection:\r\nMask\r\nGlove\r\n2 Body Cords\r\n2 Mask Cords (Foil\/Saber)\r\nLame (Foil\/Saber)\r\n\r\nUniform:\r\nAll fencers must be in USA Fencing Compliant Uniforms. Full fencing attire is required, including conductive foil bibs, fencing pants and socks that meet the knee, plastron (half jacket) and chest protector with appropriate FIE cover. If you show up without the required equipment you will not be permitted to fence!\r\n\r\nUSA FENCING GUIDELINES FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY:\r\n\r\nMask Mandate\r\n\r\nAll attendees at USA Fencing sanctioned tournaments will be required to wear a mask at all times, including athletes during competition. Face coverings must be two-layer cloth masks or surgical face coverings. Single-layer gaiters, bandannas, masks with vents and the Leon Paul Facemask Shields or similar face coverings are NOT permitted. Athletes who do not comply with this policy will not be allowed to compete. Other individuals, including spectators and coaches, who do not wear a mask or face covering will be assessed a Group 3 penalty for \u00e2\u0080\u009cany person not on strip disturbing order\u00e2\u0080\u009d which includes a yellow card warning for the first infraction and a black card resulting in expulsion from the venue for a second infraction. There will be no exceptions, for athletes or any other tournament attendee, to the mask mandate. We cannot accommodate those with conditions that would preclude wearing a mask, so anyone unable to wear a mask should stay home.\r\n\r\nScreaming\r\n\r\nResearch has shown that virus transmission occurs at higher rates when individuals scream or yell due to the increased propulsion of droplets through the air. Accordingly, yelling after a touch, or at any time during a bout, will be prohibited. As this is a significant change to a habit for many fencers, referees are advised to verbally warn fencers rather than issuing an immediate penalty. If, after warnings, the referee determines an athlete is deliberately violating the reminder not to scream, the referee can award a Group 1 penalty for refusal to obey the referee resulting in a yellow card for the first infraction and red cards for subsequent infractions. The referee also has the authority to award a Group 3 penalty for disturbing order on the strip which results in a red card for the first infraction and a black card and exclusion from the tournament for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nFor coaches\/spectators screaming a Group 3 penalty \"Any person not on strip disturbing order\" with a yellow card for the first infraction and a black card for subsequent infractions.\r\n\r\nHandshakes\r\n\r\nAthletes are to salute at the conclusion of a bout in lieu of shaking hands with each other, the referee or coaches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 04\/01\/2021.\r\nLate Registration Begins 05\/17\/2021\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/21\/2021.","venue":{"name":"Winter Garden Fencing Academy","address":"44 S.

Each event will run independently and there is a possibility that you may be called to strip for a bout in more than one event at the same time. Fencers MUST report to the strip when called. A word of caution: If a fencer starts one event and decides to withdraw from that event to fence in the other event, the fencer will be given a Black Card and disqualified from the first event. Additionally, the specified breaks in between bouts are for that event only. If you fence in more than one event, it may be possible for you to have to finish one DE bout and then immediately fence another (in the other event) without a break in between.\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify! \r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility Information:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFencers competing must be current competitive members of the US Fencing Association, registered with the USFA as a member of the Long Island Division.

We have developed a comprehensive, state of the art plan for everyone participating in the Orlando Challenge to follow and are committed to keeping you informed of the steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to keep you safe. Without question, we want to provide our fencers with incredible and inspirational experiences; but we also want you safe when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here. This tournament is subject to Florida state laws and orders regarding COVID-19. We will adhere to such laws as they apply with changing circumstances. To such a purpose we are taking every step to keep everyone safe and have developed some Covid-19 guidelines, requirements and protocols. We ask that you read these carefully.\r\n\r\nHealth Measures\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Challenge venue counts with several touch-less hand sanitizer stations throughout the complex for your convenience.\r\nAthletic trainer on site during all events.\r\nWhen anyone arrives at the Orlando Challenge, they must undergo and pass temperature screening using the CDC temperature recommendation.\r\nFencers must wear appropriate attire that their fencing uniform can be put on over in public areas. Changing completely in the venue, including restrooms is not permitted.\r\nFencers are not allowed to touch the scoring machine, weights, ships, remote or scoresheets.\r\nFencers must refrain from shaking hands after bouts or making any intentional physical contact.\r\nFencers must refrain from shouting or screaming, including after scoring a touch. Referees will warn fencers, but subsequent violations can result in penalties.\r\nFencers are not required to sign the score sheet or DE slips. They can check the results at www.fencingtimelive.com instead and report any error to the Bout Committee.\r\nOnce a fencer is eliminated from their event, they must pack their equipment up and leave the venue immediately, unless they are in the top 8. Individuals may not stay and socialize, watch remaining bouts or to observe the medal ceremony.\r\nIn order to avoid crowds, we will not have screens with results at the venue, but live tournament results and tournament progress will be posted on Fencing Time Live.\r\nFace Coverings\r\n\r\nAnyone inside the venue must wear face coverings at all times.\r\nFace masks will be sold at the venue for anyone who may have forgotten theirs.\r\nPhysical Distancing\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Challenge is fortunate enough to have partnered with a remarkable venue, the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center, this top of the line, enormous and luxurious venue exceeds all expectation for safety and guidelines. Our enormous venue is more than 110,000 square feet to provide proper social distancing.\r\nWe have spaced the event schedules to have 4 hours in between each block of events, we did this to ensure that no large crows gather at any moment (Not to mention to ensure that all events start and finish right on time).\r\nTo promote proper physical distancing during the tournament, we have signage and markings in the hallways to identify appropriate physical distancing.\r\nSeating areas, in our amazing venue, will be modified to maintain physical distancing while still providing a great view of the tournament.

No additional family members or spectators are allowed on the floor, The pass must be worn visible and around the neck at all times. Anybody without a pass will be escorted out. The number of accompanying adults permitted inside the venue will depend on the situation at the particular time, if the current health situation changes by the time the event happens, and more spectators are allowed to come, we will promptly notify all the registrants.\r\nOnly one coach\/parent is allowed to assist a fencer on strip during bouts. Coach\/parent will stand in a clearly designated area at the end of the strip and will be instructed not to step out of this area until the bout ends. Violators will be escorted out of the venue.

Everybody present in the venue must remain orderly and not disturb the smooth running of competition.  No one is allowed in the strip enclosure during pool round.   During the DE round each fencer may have 1 person inside the enclosure, and this person (coach, parent, teammate, etc) must remain at the back of the strip, and all other spectators outside the draped rail.  \r\n\r\nAt no time is anyone allowed to criticize the Officials or their decisions, to insult them or to attempt to influence them in any way.  Coaches and spectators are allowed to give advice to fencers, but must not disturb the order of the bout.  The Referee and\/or the Bout Committee on their own authority, or at the request of an official, can decide to expel from the venue, with or without a warning, any person who by gesture, attitude or language disturbs the good order or smooth running of the event.  \r\n\r\n<b>==================================================================================================================================================================<\/b>\r\n\r\n<i>WHERE SHOULD I GO FIRST?<\/i>\r\nStop at the bag station to obtain a bag for your equipment to be checked by the armory.  Place bag in designated area and then retrieve it once inside the venue at some point before your event.  Armorers will test foil and saber lame, masks, 2 body cords, 2 saber mask cords, saber cuff.   Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \u00e2\u0080\u009cnot approved for use.\u00e2\u0080\u009d  Have your lame right side out and zipped up.   Untangle and straighten body cords and mask cords, and remove any tape from previous tournaments.  \r\n\r\nScan USA Fencing membership card with barcode at the contactless self-check-in station. Print membership card on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership.  If you wish to take advantage of the age verification process, see the staff member at check-in and provide a copy of passport, birth certificate or other government-issued identification.  \r\n\r\nAfter checking in, verify your seeding information at fencingtimelive.com and report any discrepancies to the Bout Committee (BC) before close of check-in time for your event.   No changes will be made after check-in closes.\r\n\r\nPresent your signed waiver.  Only one waiver is needed per household.\r\n\r\nOnce in the venue find a location for your fencing bag (do not block doors, aisles, walking areas, or fire exits).  Tentative Pod assignments will be posted noting the location of your pool round, so you can place your fencing bag near your pool location.    Final pool strip assignments cannot be posted until close of check-in.  \r\n\r\n<i>CHECK-IN<\/i>\r\nAll times are close of check-in. We strongly encourage you to arrive at the venue at least 1 hour before close of your event registration. Venue opens at 6:30 a.m. Fencers failing to check-in by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be issued.  Fencers must check-in each day they fence. \r\n\r\n<I>WHEN WILL I START FENCING?   <\/i>\r\nEach event consists of 2 rounds (pools and then direct elimination (DE)).  Typically pools begin approximately 15 minutes after close of check-in, tournament conditions permitting.  Occasionally there will be unforeseen delays, and if this should occur we appreciate your understanding.   To avoid delays resulting from incorrect seeding of pools, it is vital you verify all information after you check in and report errors (misspelled name, wrong club, wrong rating\/ranking) to the BC before close of check-in time for your event.   \r\n\r\n<i>HOW DO I FIND OUT WHERE I WILL BE FENCING?  <\/i>\r\nListen for announcements, and shortly after check-in closes pool strip assignments will be posted on-line at  https:\/\/fencingtimelive.com. There is no wi-fi in the venue; internet access is through your cell phone or other provider.   Take spare weapons and body cords with you when reporting to the strip for your bouts.  USA Fencing Rules apply (https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book).\r\n\r\n<i>WHAT DO I DO AFTER MY POOL IS FINISHED?   <\/i>\r\nAfter finishing all your pool bouts the referee will show you the pool score sheet.  You must check scores for accuracy, then sign the pool sheet and thank the referee.   If there are any errors, do not sign until the error is corrected.  Once the pool sheet with fencer signatures is submitted there will be no changes made.   Do not leave the venue.   When <b>ALL<\/b> pools for your event are completed the results for the entire field are ordered by best to poorest (highest ratio of victories vs. bouts fenced, touches scored vs. touches received), and the DE round is seeded from these results.  \r\n\r\nOnce pool round results are posted you must again check these for accuracy and report errors immediately to the BC.  Do not leave the venue after the pool round, as there is 100% promotion to the DE round.  The DE tableau will be posted and you then report to the strip(s) indicated for your event and listen for the referee to call you.  \r\n\r\nNotify the referee if you need to leave the strip area for any reason.   You are allowed 2 calls to the strip, then if not present at the 3rd and final call you will be scratched.   \r\n\r\nThe DE round continues as winners advance until the final bout.  Medals will be awarded to Top 8 finishers.   Once you are done competing you must exit the venue quickly.  Be sure you have all your belongings and equipment, as anything left behind at the end of the day will be thrown away.  Medals for the Top 8 finishers can be picked up at the Medal table when exiting the venue.\r\n\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\/RULES\r\n<b>====================================<\/b>\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 USA Fencing rules apply.  https:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/usa-fencing-rule-book\r\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Equipment check required (mask, lame (as appropriate), sabre cuffs, head cords, and body cords). 800N Saber Glove is Mandatory.

If time and the weather allows, the best 8 female fencers from the open event will fence off for a women's award.\r\n\r\nCovid safety measures:\r\n-Event is capped at 60 competitors\r\n-Entire event will take place on the Kings Garden lawns (i.e. no finals in the more crowded parade ground this year)\r\n-All participants will wear face masks when not safely distanced from other households, including during all actual fencing bouts.  If you are not willing to fence with a face covering securely over your mouth and nose, please do not sign up for this.  Even fully vaccinated competitors must wear masks, to protect our youngest fencers, who may not yet have had the chance to get the vaccine.\r\n\r\nPlease register by May 24, to secure your place in this tournament and receive an admission pass to the Fort.   \r\n\r\nEntry fee is $15, payable at the event (so we don't have to return money if it is rained out).

No drop in fencers allowed. The event starts on 5\/30\/2021 at 9 AM.\r\n\r\nThis will be a standard format tournament with pools and direct eliminations (DEs). We will have a maximum of 24 fencers (4 pools of 6). Seeding will be done by national rank (regardless of age group), letter ranking, then randomized. Fencers will be split into pools which will be posted on fencingtimelive.com the day before the event. Everyone will fence everyone else within their pool to determine placements for direct elimination bouts. Direct elimination bouts will go to 15 touches or three 3-minute periods (whichever one comes first) unless either fencer is 10 years old or younger (Y10) in which case the elimination bout ends at 10 touches or only two 3-minute periods (whichever one comes first).\r\n\r\nAfter each direct elimination round is finished, the fencers will take turns choosing their dessert to take home starting with the last place fencer and ending with the first place fencer. \r\n\r\nThis is a non-sanctioned event so you will not earn a rating even if you are the most awesome fencing monster. But you will take home yum.\r\n\r\nAs you fence, think hard about your strategy -- do you want to get the last dessert?\r\n\r\nVERY IMPORTANT ENTRY FEE INFORMATION\r\n$20 AND a store-bought dessert (it does not have to be expensive) to go to the prize pool.  \r\n$40 if you forget your dessert and you come empty handed.\r\nYou will be billed on your Jackrabbit account. This is a fundraiser for the MTFC scholarship fund so it goes to a good cause. Please no homemade desserts due to COVID-19.\r\n\r\nCOVID-19 INFORMATION\r\nOnly current MTFC members allowed due to COVID-19 restrictions provided that Pierce County does not go back to phase 1 in which case this event will need to be cancelled and everyone can eat their own desserts. \r\n\r\nCOVID protocols will be strictly enforced. Only fencers, referees, and coaches will be allowed inside the building.\r\n\r\nAll fencers must register upon arrival and certify that they and their guest (if present) answer negative to the COVID-19 screening questions. Fencers and their family will have their temperature screened upon arrival. Any fencer or guest who has been exposed to COVID-19, has recently lost their sense of smell, or is feeling ill should stay home.\r\n\r\nFencers should bring pre-filled water bottles for the tournament. There will not be water bottle filling stations. There will be no eating inside the tournament area (indoors or outdoors) and masks may be removed for water breaks only when stationary and maintaining 6 feet of distancing.\r\n\r\nCome dressed to compete. There will be no changing area. Gear bags will remain in the waiting areas with fencers bringing only their back up blades and water bottles with them inside. If you are borrowing gear\/uniforms (plastron, chest protector, jacket, lame, gloves and mask, body and mask cord) from the club for the tournament please check with your coach before the tournament to make arrangements to check out these items ahead of time. If you are borrowing blades for the tournament then the club will have those waiting for you at the strips the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe awards ceremony will be brief and held outdoors for safety.\r\n\r\nFamily must wait and observe from outside. While waiting to be called to fence there will be designated areas for each pool. Fencers who do not keep their nose and mouth covered with a face mask during a bout will first get a warning, followed by any combination of penalties including \"clothing\/equipment not conforming,\" \"delaying the bout,\" \"refusal to obey the referee,\" and \"fencer disturbing order on the strip\" which can culminate in a black card and exclusion from the event.\r\n\r\nPlease keep your face mask on. It is only right for everyone around you.

We have developed a comprehensive, state of the art plan for everyone participating in the Orlando Challenge to follow and are committed to keeping you informed of the steps we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re taking to keep you safe. Without question, we want to provide our fencers with incredible and inspirational experiences; but we also want you safe when you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here. This tournament is subject to Florida state laws and orders regarding COVID-19. We will adhere to such laws as they apply with changing circumstances. To such a purpose we are taking every step to keep everyone safe and have developed some Covid-19 guidelines, requirements and protocols. We ask that you read these carefully.\r\n\r\nHealth Measures\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Challenge venue counts with dozens of touch-less hand sanitizer stations throughout the complex for your convenience.\r\nTemperature Screening\r\nWhen anyone arrives at the Orlando Challenge, they must undergo and pass temperature screening using the CDC temperature recommendation.\r\nFace Coverings\r\n\r\nAnyone inside the venue must wear face coverings at all times. Attendees are not required to wear them while eating and drinking, or outside the venue.\r\nFace masks will be sold at the venue for anyone who may have forgotten theirs.\r\nPhysical Distancing\r\n\r\nThe Orlando Challenge is fortunate enough to have partnered with a remarkable venue, the Gaylord Palms Resort & Convention Center, this top of the line, enormous and luxurious venue exceeds all expectation for safety and guidelines.\r\nTo promote proper physical distancing during the tournament, we have signage and markings in the hallways to identify appropriate physical distancing.\r\nSeating areas, in our amazing venue, will be modified to maintain physical distancing while still providing a great view of the tournament.\r\nBeing a youth 8 event, fencers may be accompanied by up to two individuals on strip (a parent\/guardian and\/or a coach) who will receive a special wristband per event. No additional family members or spectators are allowed on the floor, we invite them to watch from the designated viewing areas. The number of accompanying adults permitted inside the venue will depend on the situation at the particular time and the number of people in the venue. If the current health situation changes by the time the event happens, and more spectators are allowed to come, we will promptly notify all the registrants.\r\nWe ask that coaches and parents refrain from shouting or screaming at fencers in order to avoid the spread of any droplets or particles.\r\nCleaning & Sanitation To protect the health and safety of our guests sanitization of the building is cleaned and sanitized every day. The entire building, chairs, backboards, and common areas have been disinfected.

We're only allowing quarter capacity for most events instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when. We are taking and logging temperature.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14.
