Cadet DEs will take place after the Junior pools have completed, with the Junior DEs beginning as appropriate thereafter. \r\n\r\nAge-eligible fencers are STRONGLY recommended to fence in both Cadet and Junior events. If you are fencing only in Cadets, you will need to wait for Junior pools to finish before you can fence your DEs, so it makes sense to fence. Also, by fencing in Juniors you have a second opportunity to qualify for the Cadet event. (If you qualify in Junior and are age-eligible, you are qualified for Cadet as well!)\r\n\r\nThe more people that fence, the more that qualify!

Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Membership.aspx\r\n \r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event.
