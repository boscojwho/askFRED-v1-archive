We've worked through it, but please read all of the below.  Google Boatwright Rd. and College Rd., Richmond, VA 23229.  It will bring you about 100 yards from the entrance of the Weinstein Center main parking lot.  We believe there are two routes that will take you to the Weinstein Center.  If your directions have you on Boatwright, then College Road, the facility is on your left immediately past the football stadium.  If your directions say River Road to College Road, stay on College for a bit.  Facility is on your right.  If you get to the stadium, you've gone too far.\r\n\r\nREFEREES:\r\nAlways strong.

A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still\r\nparticipating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we\r\nwill show you). US Fencing Association (USFA) membership is not required as these are not sanctioned\r\nevents. These events are not rated and you cannot get a classification change from this event.\r\n\r\nEntry Fee\r\n\r\nThe basic entry fee is $5 per fencer per event. Electric equipment rental is $10 per event.\r\n\r\nElectric Equipment\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to\r\narrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you\r\nwill need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through\r\nan electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing.\r\n\r\nTournament Format\r\n\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with a round of pools and 100% promotion to direct eliminations. The\r\nrounds will be self-directed. Because this will be a mixed tournament with combined youth and adult\r\nfencers, direct elimination will be a standard 15 point, 3 period format unless either of the fencers in\r\na direct elimination bout is 12 years old or younger in which case the format will be best 2 out of 3, 5\r\npoint bouts as is standard for all 12 and under events. \r\n\r\nAdditional information\r\n\r\nDue to space and time constraints the tournament will be limited to the first 24 fencers registered.\r\nIf you cannot attend please remove your preregistration so other members of the club may participate.\r\n\r\nPlease check the club website for weather related closures for this tournament and in general at\r\nwww.tacomafencing.com.
