Come out, fence, support Barbara Lynch and the NOCC. \r\n\r\nBarbara Lynch is well known in New Jersey fencing and in the National fencing arena.  She has given tirelessly to the sport and is well known as an advocate for youth fencers.  She has been involved in NJ Fencing for over 30 years.  She is a former president of the NJ Division and has been coach at Morris Hills High School for many years.  She has been involved at the National level with USFA Bout Committee.   Barbara was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and underwent treatment which led to remission, but now is undergoing further treatment.  This RYC honors her and thanks her for her work on behalf of young fencers.\r\n\r\nThis RYC fulfills the qualifying path for Y10\/12 fencers to compete at Summer Nationals or April Youth NAC. Attending a RYC will qualify that individual in the respective event and age category fenced. \r\n\r\nRatings can be awarded, however youth events do not use the E1 or D1 classifications; these events are NR until they reach C1 level or higher.  \r\n\r\n**<b>Double NJFA Youth Cup points<\/b> will be awarded toward 2008-09 NJFA Youth Cup Series prizes.  All youth events held at NJFA from September 2008 through June 2009 are eligible for Youth Cup series prizes.  Points are awarded for first 5 places in each event (there is no fence-off for third at this RYC so third place points will be awarded to both 3rd place fencers).  Cup points are cumulative and prizes will be awarded to top 3 point finishers in each event at the last tournament of the series (more info at njfencingalliance.com)\r\n\r\n<b>FEES<\/b>\r\nWalk-in\/late fees have been waived!!

ABSOLUTELY READ THESE FOUR BULLETS BEFORE REGISTERING !!!<\/div>\r\n<ul><li>You absolutely, positively, must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in these qualifying events. You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing). If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively, will not let you compete. Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter. Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers. If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\n<li>You must both register and complete online payment to be registered for any of these events. After you complete both, confirm that your name appears under the correct events in the \"Whose Pre-registered\" list in AskFRED. On-site registration for those who didn't register or complete online payment will include an additional $10 late registration fee PER EVENT.<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\n<li>You must show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration. BE THERE and BE ON TIME.<br>&nbsp;<br>\r\n<li>If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com). As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\n<b>FAQ for Pre-Registration Policy<\/b>\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.
