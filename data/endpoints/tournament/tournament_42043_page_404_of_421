Great question! A Novice Tournament is an event we run for new fencers and parents who have never participated in a fencing tournament. The goal of the event is to introduce both parents and students to competition, and walk everyone through how fencing competitions work. This is meant to be a learning experience exclusively for our own students! We will be teaching parents and athletes:\r\n\r\nWhen to arrive\r\nWhat to do when you arrive at a tournament\r\nWhat to bring\r\nFormat of the competition\r\nHow to keep score\r\nBasic rules and common terminology\r\n\r\nWhen to arrive?\r\nTypically, you should arrive 60 minutes prior to the close of check-in.  This gives the fencer time to check in, warm up, stretch, and get some practice bouts in before the competition starts. Unclear about which event(s) your athlete should fence? Ask your coach.\r\n\r\nWhat to bring?\r\nAll fencers should bring their own glove, mask, weapon, knickers, jacket, under arm protector, and chest protector (required for girls, optional for boys). Fencers should be wearing knee socks with knickers. If you don't have your own yet, please speak to your coach ahead of time about borrowing equipment for the event. You should also bring a water bottle, snacks, and lunch. You want to make sure your fencer stays hydrated and has fuel to continue to fence!\r\n\r\nCan parents come in and watch?\r\nYes, absolutely! However, for this event we are limiting it to two spectators per fencer.\r\n\r\nHow long will the tournament last?\r\nThis depends on how many people sign up and how far your child goes. At a minimum, you should expect to be at the event for 2-3 hours.\r\n\r\nWhere is the event?\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Central, 3851 Warren St, Philadelphia, PA 19104\r\n\r\nThis tournament is meant to be a fun learning experience for both children and parents! At the Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, we take a skills-based development approach to training fencers, NOT a results-based approach. We do not care where your child finishes at any one event; we're looking to see them execute the skills they learn at practice in a competition environment. As students successfully execute what they learn in practice, the results will come naturally.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia Central","address":"3851 Warren St","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19143","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9609899,"longitude":-75.1994738,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":202262,"tournament_id":52011,"tournament":"FAP-Central Novice Y10, Y12,Y14, Junior Foil","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-11-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":202263,"tournament_id":52011,"tournament":"FAP-Central Novice Y10, Y12,Y14, Junior Foil","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-11-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":202264,"tournament_id":52011,"tournament":"FAP-Central Novice Y10, Y12,Y14, Junior Foil","full_name":"Unsanctioned Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-11-13T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":52029,"name":"Fantasia","start_date":"2022-11-13","end_date":"","comments":"Open Foil, Open Epee, and Open Saber - Attached to the Referee Clinic","prereg_open":"2022-10-22","prereg_close":"2022-11-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Open Foil, Open Epee, and Open Saber - Attached to the Referee Clinic\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed EpeeSenior Mixed FoilSenior Mixed Saber\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/22\/2022.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/12\/2022.\r\n\r\nEvents are pay at the door - cost is $20 per event.","venue":{"name":"FL","address":"360 N State Road 434","city":"Altamonte Springs","state":"FL","zip":"32714","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.6667501,"longitude":-81.4198828,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":202332,"tournament_id":52029,"tournament":"Fantasia","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-11-13T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":202333,"tournament_id":52029,"tournament":"Fantasia","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":8,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-11-13T14:45:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":202334,"tournament_id":52029,"tournament":"Fantasia","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2022-11-13T15:45:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":51022,"name":"Manhattan Fencing Center Saber Liberty Cup","start_date":"2022-11-13","end_date":"","comments":"Join MFC for a saber Liberty Cup in Y8,10,12,14 and E and Below events!

The objective is to provide youth (y8, y10, y12 and y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in y8, y10, y12 and\/or y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of escrimeur youth cup points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCalculations\r\n\r\nThe maximum number of points (mxpnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge group     mxpnts\r\n  y8\t       50\r\n  y10\t       50\r\n  y12\t      100\r\n  y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of evntxratio:\r\n\r\nEvntxratio = nentrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((nentrs - pl + 1) \/ nentrs) x mxpnts x evntxratio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nExamples\r\n\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned points for escrimeur youth cup series will be a sum of all points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nFees\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net by midnight on sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered and paid through askfred.net starting monday through midnight on saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks, venmo or zelle for payments made at the door.
