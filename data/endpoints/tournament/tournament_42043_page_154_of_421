Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase. You may join the USFA or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $10 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y10 foil event must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2001-2004\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 1999-2002\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 1997-2000\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=18688\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/01\/2012\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

It is for beginners to get a taste of tournament competition. To be eligible for the novice a fencer must have been fencing less than one year! A fencer who has fenced and\/or competed in epee or sabre for some time but only recently picked up a foil is not a novice. This is for fencers who have very little tournament experience and for their parents.\r\n \r\nUSFA membership is not required for the novice event.\r\n \r\nBefore registration in the novice competition begins, there will be an introductory talk with the fencers and parents to walk them through various aspects of tournament fencing.\r\n \r\nThe novice event may be broken into separate events based upon age and size. The novice event(s) format will be round robin pools with 100% advancement to direct elimination.\r\n\r\n<b>Other Events:<\/b>\r\nOther events occurring in Galveston, for your diversion when done with fencing, include:\r\n\r\nThe 26th Annual AIA Sandcastle Competition\r\nhttp:\/\/www.aiasandcastle.com\/\r\n\r\nArt Walk\r\nhttp:\/\/www.galveston.com\/artwalk\/\r\n\r\nThe Plankowner's Syndicate Party & Auction\r\nhttps:\/\/ghf.destinationnext.com\/plankowners.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Accommodations:<\/b>\r\nHotels depend upon what you want. Being a tourist town, Galveston hotels run the gamut. Of really nice hotels close to the venue there are two that jump out:\r\n \r\nThe Tremont House \r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSTH\/main.wnt?cid=14807\r\n \r\nThe Hotel Galvez\r\nhttp:\/\/www.wyndham.com\/hotels\/GLSHG\/main.wnt?cid=14749\r\n \r\nBoth are \"historic\" hotels operated by Wyndham. Tremont is in the Historic Strand District. The Galvez is on the beach. Neither is quite five minutes from the venue.\r\n \r\nFurther down Seawall Blvd, facing the Gulf of Mexico are three hotels, side by side, offering different price points, as they say. All three face the sea. Most of your drive to the venue would be along Seawall Blvd. from either of these three. It can be a bit busy on a weekend, but you do have the Gulf of Mexico on the right side pretty much 90%\r\nof the way, which can make up for it. In \"high traffic times\" allow fifteen minutes to reach the venue.\r\n \r\nThe San Luis http:\/\/www.sanluisresort.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Hilton http:\/\/www.galvestonhilton.com\/\r\n \r\nThe Holiday Inn\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ichotelsgroup.com\/holidayinnresorts\/hotels\/us\/en\/galveston\/glssb\/hoteldetail\r\n \r\nOne other option that is different but might be fun is Harbor House,which is located along the Galveston Waterfront (near the cruise ship terminals and the waterfront restaurants).\r\nhttp:\/\/www.harborhousepier21.com\/ \r\n \r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/28\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 05\/31\/2012.","venue":{"name":"O'Connell College Preparatory School Gym","address":"1320 Tremont Street","city":"Galveston","state":"TX","zip":"77550-4599","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":29.2966644,"longitude":-94.7905802,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":67770,"tournament_id":15945,"tournament":"Jean Laffite Classic ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-06-02T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":67771,"tournament_id":15945,"tournament":"Jean Laffite Classic ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"U-SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-06-02T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":67772,"tournament_id":15945,"tournament":"Jean Laffite Classic ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"U-SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-06-02T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":67773,"tournament_id":15945,"tournament":"Jean Laffite Classic ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"U-SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-06-02T12:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":67774,"tournament_id":15945,"tournament":"Jean Laffite Classic ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Women's Foil","short_name":"U-SrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":2,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-06-02T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":67775,"tournament_id":15945,"tournament":"Jean Laffite Classic ","full_name":"Unrated Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":6,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-06-02T14:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15187,"name":"2012 Mr Ma Cup","start_date":"2012-06-02","end_date":"2012-06-03","comments":"FULLY AIR-CONDITIONED\r\n\r\nThe 19th Annual Mr Ma Cup,\r\nBurlington Township Middle School at Springdale 1600 Burlington Bypass\r\nONLINE REGISTRATION IS NOW OPEN\r\nWe now into walkin registration $120 + $105 entry fee per","prereg_open":"2012-01-10","prereg_close":"2012-05-30","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":120,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"FULLY AIR-CONDITIONED\r\n\r\nEvents scheduled\r\nSaturday,June 2nd, 2012\r\n9:00AM\r\nY12 Women's Epee\r\nY12 Men's Epee\r\nY12 Women's Saber\r\nY12 Men's Saber\r\nY14 Women's Foil\r\nY14 Men's Foil\r\n\r\n11:00AM\r\nY10 Mixed Epee\r\nY10 Mixed Foil\r\n\r\n12:00PM\r\nY14 Women's Saber\r\nY14 Men's Saber\r\n\r\n2:00PM\r\nY10 Mixed Saber\r\nY12 Women's Foil\r\nY12 Men's Foil\r\nY14 Women's Epee\r\nY14 Men's Epee\r\n\r\nSunday, June 3rd, 2012\r\n9:00AM\r\nSenior Women's Epee\r\nSenior Women's Saber\r\nSenior Men's Epee\r\nSenior Men's Saber\r\n\r\n12:30PM\r\nSenior Women's Foil\r\nSenior Men's Foil\r\n\t\r\nEntry Fees\r\nApplication and Deadline -

Fence-A-Thon is the only tournament of the year where you can earn domestic ranking points, eat delicious goulash (goulash may be subject to availability) and fence the mystical event known only as \"flepeebre\".\r\n\r\nAs ever, registration fees are $20 per person; fencers may only register in one event due to time constraints.  Awesome prizes are awarded to the fencers who raise the most funds for the BC Cancer Foundation and to the event winners.  Pledge forms will be posted soon; the previous fundraising record is $500.\r\n\r\nWhere: St. Andrew's Regional High School, 880 McKenzie Ave. Please note, this is a different location from our regular practice space.  If you are downtown, you are at the wrong gym.\r\nWhen: 7:00pm Saturday, June 2 to 7:00am Sunday, June 3.\r\nCost: $20 per registrant, plus donations\r\nWho: Fencers of all ability! Fence-A-Thon is an excellent opportunity for competitive fencers to earn points on the Domestic Rankings, as well as a fantastic venue for newer fencers to gain experience.\r\n\r\nFor more
