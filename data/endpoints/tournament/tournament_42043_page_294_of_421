The Summer National Championships are held this year in Salt Lake City, UT July 1 - 10. \r\n\r\nDoors open at 8:00 AM and registration and equipment check opens at 8:30 AM. Times listed are \"close of registration.\" That being said, we encourage everyone (especially beginners to the sport) to be at the venue AT LEAST one half hour before the CLOSE of your event, to make sure you can sign in and get your equipment checked and approved BEFORE the close of registration for your event. \r\n\r\nFencers who wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2016-2017) competitive members of the USFA and must be members of the Oregon Division; fencers from other divisions are not eligible to compete. Y14 fencers must fall in that age bracket OR the athlete must be on the national rolling point standings in the next younger age bracket.\r\n\r\nPermanent residents who have not represented another country in the last three years may participate. If we need you to fence in order to qualify more fencers (i.e. bring the event size to 13 or 17 fencers), and you are already auto-qualified for the SN, fees are waived for you. Otherwise, we discourage auto-qualified fencers from fencing in the qualifier.\r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD! All fencers must be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership. Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nIn each event, the top 25% (minimum of 3, rounded up) who were not previously qualified (i.e. through a ROC) will qualify for SNQ. If 3 or fewer fencers show up for an event, the event will not be fenced, and all will qualify. Fencers that earn qualification at the DIV II events will automatically qualify for the corresponding DIV III events event (if rating-eligible.)\r\n\r\nPre-registration and pre-payment (the latter is a new requirement) on FRED is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Tuesday, March 21. If you sign up and pay on-line by that time, your discounted registration fees are $30 per fencer, plus $20 per event (i.e., a total of $50 for one event). You can sign-up and pay on-line after that time, but your fees will increase to double registration fee and double event fee (through March 31, 11:59pm). Starting April 1, you may fence with a fee of triple registration fee and triple event fee (this is the only circumstance in which you will be allowed to pay at the door \u0096 please bring cash or a check, made out to the Oregon Division, credit cards not accepted). \r\n\r\nIn the case that you pre-pay, and then must withdraw, the following is the Division refund policy:\r\n\u0095 By the close of on-time pre-registration \u0096 Full refund minus $5 because the Division is liable for the AskFred % fee.\r\n\u0095 Up to 11:59pm the Thursday before the event \u0096 Event fee refund only (must be a request via email to the board.)\r\n\u0095 Day of Event \u0096 Event fee refund only upon a verifiable medical withdrawal before event start.\r\n\u0095 No refunds after the fact.\r\n\r\nFull USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or saber, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. Foil events require conductive foil masks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Names on the uniform are not required for the qualifier. Weapons are checked on the strip. \r\n\r\nWe anticipate that we will offer an opportunity to get your equipment tested the night before the event, depending on Sunday morning numbers, and will confirm that fact through AskFred. Please make sure that AskFred has your current email address. \r\n\r\nHere are additional important notes:\r\nHealthy, fencer-friendly snacks are sold through a self-serve concession area. \r\n\r\nOur qualifier is entirely staffed (with the exception of the referees) by volunteers, without whom this event would not take place, so please contact the tournament organizers at Board@usfa-or.org if you can help a shift. \r\n\r\nAs a last note, in 2013, the USFA Board of Directors adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines new requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOregon Division members are invited to qualify for Summer Nationals.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 12:00 PM <b>(NOON)<\/b> check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well.

This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible. 100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender. \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n\r\nThere may be new fencers and parents at this event. We would like to recommend that you review the following guides prior to this tournament. We believe that they will provide assistance in understanding some likely fencing terms and give you a general understanding as to what to expect at a tournament.

Refer to the age\/classification exception chart in Chapter 2 of the Athlete Handbook for more information.\r\nUSA Fencing requires age verification for ALL participants (domestic and foreign).  USA Fencing is working towards an age verification process. \r\nWe suggest PRIOR TO THIS EVENT, that if the membership card does not indicate \u0093Birth Year Verified \u0096Y\u0094 that you submit a copy of the fencer\u0092s birth certificate or passport to the USA Fencing National Office via mail, in a timely manner so they may verify the Date of Birth (DOB) and provide an updated membership card (\u0093Birth Year Verified \u0096 Y\u0094)\r\n\r\nThis season, parents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nYou will not be allowed to fence, no matter what events you participated in last season, without proof of USFA competitive membership and age verification.\r\n\r\nAt this time, askfred will not let you register and pay for an event for which you are not age eligible. If you are eligible to fence in an event by virtue of being on the NRPS in a lower age category, please register for an additional event in a different category that you ARE age eligible to participate in, and then email the organizers with the name of the athlete, and the events that need to be switched around. Please verify your eligibility via NRPS BEFORE doing this! No refunds will be given for ineligible fencers who mistakenly enter.\r\n\r\nWAIVER OF LIABILITY:\r\nA completed waiver form signed by a parent or legal guardian is required. To help speed up the registration process, please DOWNLOAD the waiver form, print it, read it, sign it, and bring it to the table with you.

Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\n\r\nSEEDING: Seeding for Youth Events shall be based on the following order:\r\n1. Current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon. This filters down the entire list, not just the top 32 as done in a NAC.\r\n2. Letter ranking with year classification\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nSeeding for Regional Cadet Events will be posted when the Tournament Committee designates how these events will be seeded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT:\r\nAll RYC events will be one round of pools with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 (whenever possible; however, equal pools sizes should be used per RYC guidelines) with 100% of the fencers promoted to a DE tableau. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations.\r\nNo fence off for 3rd place.\r\nFor Y10 direct elimination bouts are 10 touch bouts (2 three minute periods with 1 minute break in between). During the 1 minute break, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nFor Y12, Y14, Cadet, Junior events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nAll events serve as qualifying paths to national tournaments; therefore, no events may be combined regardless of number of entrants.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS:\r\nPlease see the Athlete Handbook for the latest details on points for Regional Youth Circuit events, as well as qualifications to National Events.\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the scoring of touches is used. The competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classification. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\nPoints, classifications and qualification are not finalized until complete results, membership forms and program service fee are received by the National Office. Fencers who earn a new classification on Saturday or Sunday of the tournament may not use that classification for subsequent events on Sunday or Monday of this tournament.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents

Coming north, we are just past Dunkin\u0092 Donuts. Entrances and parking can be found both in front of and in back of the building: keep going all the way around.\r\n\r\nWe take pride in running events as close to schedule as possible. If you are having trouble finding us, or if you are delayed en-route and are not sure about being on time for check-in, please call the club at 267-482-9597 or Bout Committee at 215-450-7546.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISED NO-SHOW POLICY effective 8\/2015\r\nIn order that we can continue to hire sufficient professional referees, Liberty Fencing Club is enforcing a new no-show policy for the 2015-16 season. If a fencer fails to check in for a tournament he or she is preregistered for, or if the preregistration is cancelled less than 48 hours before close of check-in, it is considered a no-show. If a fencer no-shows more than once in a season or calendar year, he or she will not be permitted to register for subsequent tournaments without prepaying, and prepaid fees will be forfeited if the fencer no-shows again. If three or more different fencers from a club no-show during the year, LFC reserves the right to require prepayment from all other fencers from that club.\r\n\r\nPAYMENT POLICY\r\nPre-payment of tournament fees is not required except as per the no-show policy above. Prepaid fees will not be refunded in the event of a no-show or late scratch. If the fencer cancels registration more than 48 hours before the tournament, pre-paid fees may be applied to a future LFC tournament. Pre-paid fees (excluding FRED charges) will be refunded if events are cancelled.\r\nDue to the need to accurately hire referees, we are sorry, but there can be no refunds for prepayments.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Liberty Fencing Club","address":"366 Easton Road","city":"Warrington","state":"PA","zip":"18976","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2228766,"longitude":-75.140676,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":143272,"tournament_id":36146,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-29T11:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":143273,"tournament_id":36146,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-29T12:30:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"},{"id":143274,"tournament_id":36146,"tournament":"Liberty Youth Saber","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-29T14:00:00-04:00","fee":"20.00"}]},{"id":36402,"name":"NHS Spring Invitational","start_date":"2017-04-29","end_date":"","comments":"Noblesville High School Fencing Club is hosting an unsanctioned saber competition on Saturday, April 29.

Qualification occurs by \"competing\" in a DIV II\/DIV III event for the weapon you would be interested in fencing for VET's at Summer Nationals. Qualification is limited to DIV II\/DIV III eligible fencers rated C and Below. Qualification for VET events is not dependent on your placement in the DIV II\/III qualifier (and is therefore automatic based solely on participation). However, any placement within the top 25% would additionally qualify you to compete in a DIV II\/DIV III event as allowed by your placement and classification. Therefore, a separate VET qualifier is not necessary, and will not be fenced. \r\n\r\nFinal results, if applicable, and ALL qualifying notices with instructions for registering for Summer Nationals with USA Fencing will be sent to qualifying fencers NLT Sunday, April, 30, 2017.\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, you may contact me, if by email at larry@indianafencing.org or by phone at 317-344-9088.\r\n\r\nThank you and good luck,\r\n\r\nLarry Shipp\r\n\r\nLarry Shipp\r\nChair, Indiana Division USA Fencing \r\n\r\nPreregistration closed on 04\/26\/2017.\r\n\r\nThe following events will NOT BE FENCED:\r\n\r\nMen Y14 Epee\r\nMen Y14 Foil\r\nMen Y14 Sabre\r\nWomen Y14 Epee\r\nWomen Y14 Foil\r\nWomen Y14 Sabre\r\nDIV II\/III Men's Foil\r\nDIV II\/III Women's Epee\r\nDIV II\/III Women's Foil\r\nDIV II\/III Women's Sabre\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Indianapolis Fencing Club","address":"7606 E 82nd Street","city":"Indianapolis","state":"IN","zip":"46256","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9059342,"longitude":-86.033889,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":19,"name":"Indiana","abbrev":"IN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":145281,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Women's DIV II\/III Foil","short_name":"Dv2WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145283,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Men's DIV II\/III Epee","short_name":"Dv2ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145284,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Men's DIV II\/III Foil","short_name":"Dv2MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145285,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Men's DIV II\/III Saber","short_name":"Dv2MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":5,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145286,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Women's Saber","short_name":"Y14WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145287,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145328,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y14ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145329,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Y14 Men's Saber","short_name":"Y14MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":145333,"tournament_id":36706,"tournament":"Indiana Division Summer National Qualifier","full_name":"Div2 Women's DIV II\/III Epee","short_name":"Dv2WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":1,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"DIV II\/III","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":36707,"name":"Firebird Cup","start_date":"2017-04-29","end_date":"","comments":"Join us this spring for the 6th annual Firebird Cup at Indianapolis Fencing Club's fencing facility in Indianapolis.
