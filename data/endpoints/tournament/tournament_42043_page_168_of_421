Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available. Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 36 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82494,"tournament_id":20015,"tournament":"FAP Y-14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":10,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-12-09T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20304,"name":"NYFA Youth Challenge #2 Foil Y8\/10 Epee Y10\/12","start_date":"2012-12-09","end_date":"","comments":"NYFA Youth Challenge. $35 for fencers pre-registered through AskFRED; $50 walk-ins at the door.","prereg_open":"2012-10-03","prereg_close":"2012-12-08","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Foil Y8,Y10 and Epee Y10,Y12 mixed events. $35 for fencers pre-registered through AskFRED; $50 walk-ins at the door.\r\n\r\nLocation and directions:\r\n\r\nNYFA is located on the second floor at 2896 West 12th Street, between Neptune Avenue and Surf Avenue in Coney Island, Brooklyn.

The season consists of three individual event dates in the traditional USFA format: a pool round for seeding followed by a direct elimination table which will result in a 1st place, a 2nd place and two 3rd place winners.  Pool bouts are fenced to 5 points, while in the direct elimination round, the athletes will fence best two out of three 5 touch bouts.  Rules are patiently spelled out for a novice child fencer.   Points will be awarded for the top 32 competitors in each event.  Individuals who register for the San Diego Scholastic Fencing Conference will have their results tracked and tabulated for overall SDSFC individual with awards given at an end of the year banquet.  Medals are awarded at each tournament, and results tracked and tabulated for overall SDSFC individual awards given at an end of the year banquet.  The more competitions a child goes to, and the higher their finish, the more points they earn toward the big trophy at the end of the season.  At this age group, we combine foil equipment and epee rules for a friendly, fast event.  We\u0092ve found this combination is perfect for the young fencing student who wants to try their hand at a beginner-friendly tournament.  The matches are fenced with electric foils and foil body cords, but without lam\u00e9s.  This configuration produces a light on the scoring machine for a touch anywhere on the body just like epee, without the need for epee equipment.  No right-of-way rules are enforced, so every touch is rewarded with a point, and it\u0092s possible for two fencers to score at the same time.  The kids have great fun while being introduced to the USFA system of running tournaments based on pools and direct elimination. Registration fees for each individual tournament is $25.00\r\n\r\nMiddle School:\r\nGRADES 5 \u0096 8: MIXED GENDER, TEAM NCAA ROUND ROBIN FORMAT,\r\nTHREE STARTERS AND AT LEAST ONE ALTERNATE PER TEAM, USFA MEMBERSHIP REQUIRED\r\n\r\nFencers compete on teams formed around school affiliations which are club based (e.g. LionHeart Fencing Academy).   If an athlete attends a school with a team, he or she must compete for that team throughout the season.  If an athlete does not have a school team, they will be assigned to a composite team comprised of other \u0093orphans\u0094 from their club.  The season consists of a complete round robin in which all teams rotate to fence the others.  This includes the very first match of the year \u0096 when teammates fence one another.  There are no medals awarded at the meets.  Instead, at the end of the year, awards are given to the top three teams, as well as to the top three men and women in each weapon.  \r\nWhen one team meets another, there are nine 5 touch bouts.  The first team to reach five bout victories claims the team match.  All nine bouts are fenced regardless of the team match score, because the statistics for every individual are tracked for Individual awards. Most of the coaches try to fence all \u0093competition ready\u0094 kids in a match, but that is at the coach\u0092s discretion and is not always possible nor is it guaranteed.  Please realize that when a coach takes an athlete out of competition, or an athlete takes themselves out by not fencing a bout for any reason, they lose a chance at a victory which could affect both their team and individual standing.  It is possible that an athlete could place first as an individual while being on a team that finishes last, or vice versa.  Coaches with outstanding individuals may choose NOT to substitute the athlete, because doing so will jeopardize their chance at an individual medal.  Historically, the top athletes in the conference have the ability to finish the season undefeated, or with only one loss. The conference is non-profit, and charges a one-time seasonal $225.00 registration fee per team.  This fee covers the cost of facility rentals, referee fees, and awards given at the end of the year.  It does not cover the awards banquet, which will be billed separately at $10.00 per person, or $40.00 per family (your choice).   USFA membership is required, for insurance reasons.  The USFA charges $60.00 per year, and membership can be completed on the day of the first event, or online at usfencing.org.  Registration with the USFA and the seasonal conference fees are due on or before the first event.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 11\/08\/2012.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/17\/2012.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Lion Heart Fencing Academy\/TTFC (sabre only)","address":"8380 Center Drive","city":"La Mesa","state":"CA","zip":"91942","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":32.775606,"longitude":-117.016608,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":9,"name":"San Diego","abbrev":"SND","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":84957,"tournament_id":20639,"tournament":"SD Scholastic Fencing- Middle\/Elementary","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Beginners only please Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"Beginners only please","close_of_reg":"2012-12-15T15:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84958,"tournament_id":20639,"tournament":"SD Scholastic Fencing- Middle\/Elementary","full_name":"Mixed Middle Schoolers Grades 5-8 Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"Middle Schoolers Grades 5-8","close_of_reg":"2012-12-15T14:45:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":84959,"tournament_id":20639,"tournament":"SD Scholastic Fencing- Middle\/Elementary","full_name":"Mixed Middle Schoolers Grades 5-8 Team Foil","short_name":"MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"Middle Schoolers Grades 5-8","close_of_reg":"2012-12-15T09:00:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":20895,"name":"FAD Scholastic Novice Youth Tournament","start_date":"2012-12-15","end_date":"","comments":"This tournament is designed for novice youth fencers ages 7 to 18.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":82495,"tournament_id":20016,"tournament":"FAP Open Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2012-12-16T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":19520,"name":"Holiday Sabre","start_date":"2012-12-16","end_date":"","comments":"Nellya Youth Circuit Event ","prereg_open":"2012-08-21","prereg_close":"2012-12-15","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is a Nellya Circuit Event.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nY10 Mixed Saber\r\nY12 Mixed Saber\r\nY14 Mixed Saber\r\n\r\nThe times listed are the CLOSE of registration; fencing will begin approximately 30 minutes later.
