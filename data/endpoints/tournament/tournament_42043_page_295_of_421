Additionally it is a qualifying path for Summer Nationals. The top 40% of finishers in D1A and D2\/3 will receive points. Any fencer who accumulates points over the course of the season will qualify. If a fencer qualifies via points for Div1A and is rating eligible, they will also qualify for Div 2\/3.Fencers who qualify for Div 2 and meet classification requirements for Div 3 will also qualify for Div 3. Foreign fencers with a current FIE license can participate but foreign fencers are not eligible to compete in USFA national championships.\r\n\r\nThe Athlete\u0092s Handbook:(http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0103\/2516\/2016-2017_Athlete_Handbook_12.16.16.pdf) contains detailed information on qualifying pathways for summer nationals and should be used as the appropriate reference document. \r\nThis particular ROC is in honor of Coach Jeff Wolfe. This event is proudly held in his memory. Jeff Wolfe, a longtime coach at Brentwood High School, fenced at New York University. After graduating he became a teacher at Brentwood High School where he began both a Boys' Team and a Girls' Team. The Girls' Team was the first girls' varsity program on Long Island. During his tenure (1971- 1998) the Girls' Team had 18 undefeated seasons, 19 League Championships and 18 Sectional Championships. The team set a N. Y. State record winning 98 consecutive dual meets. Jeff Wolfe's W-L record at Brentwood was 388-14. Eight of his fencers became collegiate All- Americans. Four represented the United States in international competition. In 1987, he was the first recipient of the NFCAA Regional Coach Of the Year Award. In 1988 he was named to coach the US Cadet Team at the Continental Cadet Championships and the World Cadet Championships. Coach Wolfe was a highly respected member of the fencing community, and is greatly missed by all those who knew him.\r\n\r\nCost Information:\r\n\r\nRegistration is through askFRED.net.

San Francisco high school coaches would like to invite your school district to participate in the California All-State Invitational High School Fencing Tournament.\r\n\r\nTournament Format:\r\n\r\nEach participating school district will field one \u0093All Star\u0094 boys team and one \u0093All Star\u0094 girls team of three to twelve eligible high school fencers each, chosen from all of that school district\u0092s high school fencers.  This team will be headed by one or two coaches, chosen from all of that school district\u0092s coaches.  Normally there is a participation limit of one girls team and one boys team per school district, but this year we are waiving this rule in order to field as many teams possible.  Therefore each school district may enter as many teams and fencers as they wish for the All-State tournament.  \r\n\r\nAs an example of how we in the San Francisco High School District choose our All-State team.  We select our team members at our S.F. All-City Tournament, which is held at the end of the fencing season at an individual boys and girls event.  For the boy\u0092s team, up to an additional four boys are voted by all coaches as the All-City Team.  At the end of the All-City Meet, a boy\u0092s team and girl\u0092s team plus coaches are selected from all of our high schools to represent San Francisco in the All-State Tournament.\r\n\r\nThe All-State tournament this year will host girls and boys individual events.  We encourage each district to field any number of girls they wish in a girl\u0092s individual tournament.  The format for both the boys and girls events will be pools, followed by direct eliminations with fence-off for third, where points will be earned by the final placing.  The total points for the top three placing girls or boys from each district will be added together to determine the first place school districts in the girls and boys teams event.  \r\nThe first place team trophy for boys and the first place team trophy for girls are perpetual trophies, which have been in the school systems for years.\r\n\r\nTo enter a team, a letter requesting a seat in the All-State tournament is needed from each school district wishing to participate. \r\nThis letter is requested, along with $30.00 (to cover the costs of prizes and gym rental).  Please make out the check to Pannonia Athletic Club, and bring both to the tournament.\r\n\r\nThe prizes are as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst place boys team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\nFirst place girls team\u0097perpetual trophy.\r\n\r\nThere will also be 24 medals awarded for:\r\n\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place teams (boys and girls, 3 medals per team)\r\nFirst, Second, and Third place individual(boys and girls)\r\n\r\nNO USFA membership is required, no ratings will be awarded. \r\nAll other USFA rules and regulations apply.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Academy HS","address":"555 Portola Dr","city":"San Francisco","state":"CA","zip":"94131","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":37.7454156,"longitude":-122.4486465,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":6,"name":"Northern California","abbrev":"NORCAL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":144675,"tournament_id":36514,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Women's Foil","short_name":"JrWF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":9,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-29T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":144676,"tournament_id":36514,"tournament":"California High School All-State Invitational","full_name":"Junior Men's Foil","short_name":"JrMF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Junior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":14,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-29T09:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":36775,"name":"Mountain View Open Foil 2017","start_date":"2017-04-29","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for fun practice tournament with the Kona Silver Swords.\r\n","prereg_open":"2017-04-07","prereg_close":"2017-04-29","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"Mountain View Gym","address":"18-1345A Volcano Rd","city":"Mountain View","state":"HI","zip":"96771","country":"USA","timezone":"Pacific\/Honolulu","latitude":19.5485237,"longitude":-155.1079677,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":15,"name":"Hawaii","abbrev":"HI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":145541,"tournament_id":36775,"tournament":"Mountain View Open Foil 2017","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":11,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-29T10:45:00-10:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":36520,"name":"Alaska Division Summer National Qualifiers, Saber","start_date":"2017-04-29","end_date":"","comments":"This is for Men's and Women's saber qualifiers for Summer Nationals.","prereg_open":"2017-03-06","prereg_close":"2017-04-27","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"This is for Men's and Women's saber qualifiers for Summer Nationals.\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Women's Saber\r\nSenior Men's Saber\r\n\r\nFees:\r\n$20 registration \r\n$10 for the first weapon\r\n$5  for additional weapons\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Pacific Northern Academy Gym","address":"9251 Lake Otis Parkway","city":"Anchorage","state":"AK","zip":"99507","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Anchorage","latitude":61.137087,"longitude":-149.832859,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":13,"name":"Alaska","abbrev":"AK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":144696,"tournament_id":36520,"tournament":"Alaska Division Summer National Qualifiers, Saber","full_name":"Div2 Senior Men's Saber","short_name":"Dv2SrMS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2017-04-29T09:30:00-08:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":36776,"name":"Mountain View Youth Foil 2017","start_date":"2017-04-29","end_date":"","comments":"Join us for a fun practice Tournament with the Kona Silver Swords!\r\n\r\nWe are hoping to run a youth Tournament if we can get the participants.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

For 'Walk and Roll', events, 'Walkers' bouting each other will use strips as usual for pools and DEs.  Bouts with 'Rollers' will be fenced seated.  If you haven't done this before, you will quickly learn that not being able to run away or dance around forces one to get really good with blade-work. Sort of like being backed up to the end of the strip. Like to get better at not dying at the end of the strip?  Do 'Walk and Roll'.   Try it - you'll like it!  The Saturday 'Walk and Roll' saber event is schedule between the youth and senior events so that youth can stay after and fence seated and seniors can come early and warm up fencing seated.  Because this event is open to all ages, you will understand that some bouts will be teaching or learning opportunities and some will be serious training opportunities.

A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\nSPECTATORS:\r\n\r\nEverybody taking part in or present at a fencing competition must remain orderly and must not disturb the smooth running of the competition.

Those wishing to opt out of media coverage must inform the Bout Committee.**\r\n\r\nNJFA is a member of the NJ Division of the USFA http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org\/\r\n\r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n\r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n\r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n\r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n\r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n\r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS\r\nClassifications (ratings) can be awarded, however youth events must exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in classifications. Please refer to the USFA Classification Chart at: http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/Events\/About-Tournaments\/Classification-Chart.aspx\r\n\r\nClassifications are not finalized until the complete results and membership forms are received by the National Office. \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n\r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.

Current ratings can be verified here:  http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-member-list Current points standings can be verified here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n\r\nSeeding will be determined by the following criteria, in this order:\r\n1. Current National Rolling Point Standings according to age group and weapon. \r\n2. Letter Classification with year.\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nLive tournament seeding and results can be found at http:\/\/missionfencingcenter.com\/results during the event. \r\n\r\nIt is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any registration discrepancies before the close of check-in for the event.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs \u0096 Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $35 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.
