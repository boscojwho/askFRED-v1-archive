If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94046,"tournament_id":23330,"tournament":"FAP Div III Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":11,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-20T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":98430,"tournament_id":23330,"tournament":"FAP Div III Sabre","full_name":"Div3 Senior Women's Saber","short_name":"Dv3SrWS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"","entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24112,"name":"FCC Foil Tournament","start_date":"2013-10-20","end_date":"","comments":"1st official FCC tournament of the fall!

You acknowledge you are entering this tournament at your own risk and release USA Fencing and its sponsors, BCAF, and referees from any liability. With entry you give consent to BCAF to obtain medical care from any licensed physician, hospital, or clinic for any injury or illness that may arise during activities associated with this tournament. **\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n$30\/event PAYABLE AT THE DOOR (cash or check only). $40\/event for walk-ins. \r\nA's fence for free!\r\n\r\n***Cash & exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2013-2014 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-West Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event. Events may be combined by unanimous vote if there are 6 - 14 fencers in either event.\r\n\r\nSnacks & beverages available for purchase.

Masks can be decorated behind the line of sight provided that nothing can come loose and cause a risk of injury. Bring hydration and snacks.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nYou must be an active member of Metro Tacoma Fencing Club (MTFC) and have either completed\r\nfencing 1 (adults) or progressed beyond the introduction stage with Coach Andy for a youth fencer\r\n(more than 1 month fencing). A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still\r\nparticipating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we\r\nwill show you). US Fencing Association (USFA) competitive membership is not required as these are not\r\nsanctioned events. You will still need at least a non-competitive membership to the USFA. This\r\nevent is not rated and you cannot get a classification change from this event. Top 4 finishers will earn medals.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE\r\n\r\nThe basic entry fee is $5 per fencer. Electric equipment rental is $10 per event. The equipment rental is separate from the membership dues which cover general open fencing.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to\r\narrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you\r\nwill need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through\r\nan electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nWe will conduct our tournament with a round of pools and 100% promotion to direct eliminations. The\r\nrounds will be self-directed. Because this will be a mixed tournament with combined youth and adult\r\nfencers, direct elimination will determined by the age of the fencers involved. If either fencer is\r\nyoung (Y10 or those born 2003 or later) or veteran (those born 1973 or earlier)--the format will\r\nbe up to 10 points or a total of two 3 minute periods with a one minute break. If both fencers are 11-39 years old the direct elimination bout goes to 15 points as is standard for senior events and current youth age scoring.\r\n\r\nThe directors will help and explain the format if there are any questions.\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\r\n\r\nDue to space and time constraints the tournament will be limited to the first 24 fencers registered.\r\nIf you cannot attend please remove your preregistration so other members of the club may participate.\r\n\r\nA rule by Coach Toby the Enforcer is that anyone who signs up for the event and does not make it\r\nbut does not remove himself or herself from AskFRED may be accidentally removed from our next in-house\r\nevent pre-registration list.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Foil\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/25\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/24\/2013.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club (MTFC)","address":"1106 South 15th Street","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","zip":"98405","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.2478596,"longitude":-122.4508758,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":97475,"tournament_id":24335,"tournament":"MTFC In-House Masquerade Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":15,"prereg_count":17,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-25T18:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":24352,"name":"FIT Friday Night Fights (Foil \"C\" and Under)","start_date":"2013-10-25","end_date":"","comments":"Fencers must be competitive members of US Fencing and have a signed waiver to participate.","prereg_open":"2013-09-26","prereg_close":"2013-10-24","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"FRED Announces the FIT Friday Night Fights (Foil \"C\" and Under)\r\n\r\nFencers must be competitive members of US Fencing and have a signed waiver to participate.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: FIT Friday Night Fights (Foil \"C\" and Under)\r\nDate(s): 10\/25\/2013\r\nLocation: Fencing Institute of Texas, Inc.\r\n11482 Luna Road, Suite 100\r\nFarmers Branch, TX 75234\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nC & Under Senior Mixed Foil  | Fri 10\/25 | 6:00 PM\r\n\r\nAll US Fencing rules will be followed.

Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nThe Y10\/Y12 event is for fencers born in 2001 or later. All other events are for fencers born in 2000 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. The Div III event is for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2013-2014) competitive members of the USFA or CFF. All fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $30+tax per team. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=23848\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/25\/2013\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

This is a USA Fencing Senior sanctioned event through the Western PA Division of USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nThis is a USFA sanctioned event, and all USFA rules will be followed for the competition.  Appropriate attire is required (Jacket, Kickers, Mask, Plastron, Socks and glove all in good repair and working order).  \r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: The FOIL MASK rules implemented in 2012 requiring the bottom of the foil bib to be conductive will be in effect! If you have not yet gotten a new foil mask with conductive bib or a conductive bib conversion kit NOW IS THE TIME TO DO IT! We will NOT have a vendor on site so if you  don't have one, you will not be permitted to fence foil.  \r\n\r\nEpee fencers will NOT be allowed to use a foil mask with a conductive bib in epee, as this can block valid touches to that area of the bib.  \r\n\r\nMasks, weapons and body cords will be tested at check-in. Please ensure that each competitor has two working body cords, and that no single individual brings more than 5 cords to the armorers table to be tested at a time.  Zink Hall has men's and women's locker rooms with shower facilities.  Local foods available are Subway, Dominos Pizza, The Commonplace Coffeehouse and Roastery (great Coffee), and Arbys are all within walking distance. Additionally, the club will be selling snacks, water and sports  drinks.  \r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE!!!! We are still looking for qualified referees with their (mandatory) USA Fencing Professional\u0094 membership for this tournament. \r\n\r\nFor questions or for people wishing to referee the competition, please email Ashly Youngkin at: a.r.youngkin@iup.edu\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: IUP \"Spooktacular\" Open Foil and Epee\r\nDate(s): 10\/26\/2013\r\nLocation: Zink Hall Gyms A and B\r\n\r\n\r\nEvent        |     Date    |   Registration Closes\r\nSenior Mixed Epee  | Sun 10\/30 | 1:00 PM\r\nSenior Mixed Foil  | Sun 10\/30 | 9:00 AM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=24186\r\nPreregistration via AskFred closes on 10\/25\/2013 After that date, people wanting to participate will need to contact the club president for permission to pre-register.\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Initial seeding, seeding after pools and final placements will be posted in the venue. Fencers are responsible for verifying the posted lists, and signing their pool and DE sheets. Reseeds due to information that it was the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of (NRPS standing, club representation, etc) will result in a $25 fine, payable in cash.

Age status will be checked against USFA membership data - bring proof of age if there are discrepancies. While fencers are encouraged to get memberships directly through the USFA prior to the competition, completed USFA membership forms will be accepted at the door. If you do not have proof of membership, you will be required to complete and pay for a membership. Payment for memberships is made directly to the USFA (NO CASH!); bring separate check or credit card number (preferred) for membership. Fencers under 18 years old are reminded they need the signature of a parent or guardian (not a coach) on BOTH the membership and waiver forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiver of Liability\r\nThe Louisiana Division Waiver of Liability is required to be filled out and signed.

Please see separate details for the novice event below:\r\n\r\nFor the USFA competitions, all USFA rules will apply. Masks, bodycords and lames will be checked at the armory before competition.\r\n\r\n<b>NOTE ON NOVICE COMPETITIONS<\/b>\r\nThis is a non-USFA event. It is for beginners to get a taste of tournament competition. To be eligible for the novice a fencer must have been fencing less than one year! For example: A fencer who has fenced and\/or competed in epee or sabre for a couple of years but only recently picked up a foil is not a novice. This is for fencers who have very little tournament experience and for their parents.\r\n\r\nCompetitive USFA membership is not required for the novice event. We do require the $5.00 non-competitive membership for the Novice events. Those memberships may be taken at the door.\r\n\r\nThe conductive foil bib is not required for novice foil.\r\n\r\nBefore registration in the novice competition begins, there will be an introductory talk with the fencers and parents to walk them through various aspects of tournament fencing.\r\n\r\nThe novice event may be broken into separate events based upon age and size, at the discretion of the tournament organizers, at the time of the tournament. The novice event format will be determined by the tournament organizers at the time of the competition. Novice events may be round-robin pools only or pools plus direct elimination.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>Waiver:<\/b>\r\nAll competitors must submit a copy of the Gulf Coast Division waiver of liability and consent to treat form. Copies will be available at the venue. You can also download and print your own: https:\/\/app.box.com\/s\/j8a12ltuhjrckczgj8bk\r\n\r\nFencers under age 18 must have a <b><i>parent's signature<\/i><\/b> on this form.\r\n\r\n<b>USFA\/US Fencing Membership:<\/b>\r\nCurrent competitive membership of the USFA required (except for Novice events). Membership forms will be available at the venue. If your membership is not pre-validated, you must be prepared to show proof of USFA membership, or at the door, fill out a membership form and pay at that time.\r\n\r\nPersons under age 18 MUST have a parent's signature on the USFA form.\r\n \r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/10\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/24\/2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Clear Lake City Recreational

Participation qualifies fencers for the Y10 or Y12 competitions at North American Cups (as age appropriate), while the winners of the Y-14 events are qualified for Summer Nationals. Events may be combined to provide a larger field of competition if there are fewer than 5 entries of one gender. In the Y14 event, because only the winner secures qualification to the Y14 National Championships, we will run non-mixed events.\r\n\r\nFencers that wish to fence in two events on the same day must report to the strip when called or they may be scratched from the event. We will try to accommodate people as best we can, but we will not delay events if a fencer is still fencing in another event.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT: Note: At least 2 athletes must compete (have fenced) in a given RYC age\/weapon event to fulfill eligibility requirements for the Y10 and\/or Y12 NAC or for a first place finish to result in qualification to the Y14 Summer National Championships. Event results submitted with only 1 participant listed will not result in the athlete fulfilling qualification requirement. i.e. Y14 events will need to have at least two athletes of the same gender to be a qualifying event.\r\n\r\nBRING YOUR MEMBERSHIP CARD! All fencers must be current USFA members and be able to provide proof of membership. You may complete the application at the door, however the division STRONGLY encourages you to apply on-line at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org before the event and print out the receipt to show as proof of membership. Members without proof of membership will need to pay for another membership at the door. One-day memberships are not valid for this tournament.\r\n\r\nFull USFA uniform is mandatory, including mask, jacket, plastron (underarm protector), fencing knickers, knee-length socks, lame, and glove. Each fencer will be required to have two working electric weapons (foil, epee, or sabre, as appropriate), and two working body\/head cords as needed. All Y10 fencers will be required to use size \"0\" or size \"2\" blades (i.e., less than 32.5 inches long). Foil events require conductive foil masks.\r\n\r\nEffective August 1, 2013, the DE format for Y10 and Y12 events has changed. Y10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 hits or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. Y12 direct elimination bouts are for 15 hits or end when 3 periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period have passed. \r\n\r\nEquipment checks will be conducted. Please make sure your mask, body cords, weapons, and lames are in good working order prior to the event. Limited types of replacement equipment are available at SCF (Salem). Because there are only a few people signed up for the Sat am events, we will not be holding a Friday equipment check. However, we encourage people for later events to check equipment early.  If you are fencing Sunday, please come by on Saturday to get your stuff checked and approved, and help us reduce lines the day of your event. Thanks!\r\n\r\nAge Requirements (2013-2014 Season only):\r\nY10: Birth years of 2003 - 2006\r\nY12: Birth years of 2001 - 2004\r\nY14: Birth years of 1999 - 2002\r\n\r\nPre-registration on AskFred is REQUIRED by 11:59pm on Wednesday Oct. 23, 2013 (i.e. THREE days before the event) If you are pre-registered by the deadline, pay just $15 per fencer registration fee and $10 per event at the door (i.e. $25 for one event and $35 for two events.) After the close of regular pre-registration time to 9pm of the day prior to the tournament, fencers are welcome at triple registration fee and double event fee (i.e. $45 to register and $20 per event), if board notified prior to 9pm Friday. The day of the event you may fence with a walk-in fee of double triple (i.e. $90 per fencer and $60 per event.) However, we don\u0092t want that, so please just register on time and save yourself some money.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that we only accept cash or checks at Division events. CREDIT CARDS ARE NOT ACCEPTED. Please make checks out to the Oregon Division\/USFA. \r\n\r\nThanks to parent volunteers, we anticipate offering an affordable lunch, similar to those offered during our previous RYCs. \r\n\r\nOn July 17th, the USFA Board of Directors adopted the USFA SafeSport policy, which outlines new requirements for all individuals who have frequent contact with minors. This includes coaches, referees, division officers, bout committee members, etc. Everyone is encouraged to familiarize themselves with the policy, which can be found here: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/892379-safe-sport. Certain aspects of the SafeSport policy may be modified by the USFA Board of Directors in September. We will provide updates as we get more information. Feel free to contact any of the Division Officers if you have questions.\r\n\r\nCome support our kids, families, and sport and eat with us! And thank you for signing up for this event!\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salem Classical Fencing","address":"2455 McGilchrist Street SE","city":"Salem","state":"OR","zip":"97302","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":44.9168229,"longitude":-123.0119382,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":11,"name":"Oregon","abbrev":"OR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":95557,"tournament_id":23747,"tournament":"Cherry City Oregon Division RYC #

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":94047,"tournament_id":23331,"tournament":"FAP Y14 Unclassified Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":2,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-10-27T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]}]}
