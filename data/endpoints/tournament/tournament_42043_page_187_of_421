Along with registering with the Powerade State Games, athletes need to go to the website AskFRED.net to place themselves on the event listings. This website assists in the logistics of administering the fencing events, as it tracks fencer\u0092s ratings and other pertinent information.  For those who are unable to register online using a credit card, please contact the Powerade State Games office to learn more about alternative entry options.\r\n \r\nRULES: USFA rules (www.usfencing.org) will govern competition. Look under rules, charts, and handbooks for the 2012-2013 Athlete Handbook for details.\r\n \r\nELIGIBILITY: Senior mixed events are USFA sanctioned events. All participants in these events must be USFA members (memberships will be available for purchase on-site). USFA one-day memberships will be allowed at this event. Please visit www.usfencing.org to become a member before the tournament. Every participant in these events will be required to show their USFA membership card at registration prior to competition. All participants must be amateurs, and must be at least 13 years old as of December 31 of the current fencing season (2012\/2013), to compete in the open fencing events. For Y12 events athlete must be between ages of 9 and 12 years as of December 31 of the fencing season (2012\/2013). The Y12 events are USFA sanctioned events, and the participants have to be USFA members. All participants must conform to the USFA rules concerning equipment.\r\n\r\nParticipants must be residents or attending schools in North Carolina, OR residents of contiguous states with no State Games of their own, OR residents of states with reciprocating rights to enter with the Powerade State Games.\r\n \r\nCOMPETITION FORMAT: Fencers will compete in pools of approximately 5-8 athletes, and then the results from pool bouts will be used to place competitors into the direct elimination brackets. There will be 80% advancement into the direct elimination brackets for events with 30 or more competitors.  There will be 100% advancement for events with 29 or fewer competitors. Direct elimination bouts will continue through the finals to determine overall placement.\r\n \r\nAWARDS: The top three finishers overall in each event (Open and Y12) will receive gold, silver and bronze medals. There will be no fence off for third place, thus there will be two bronze medals awarded. Also Awards for the top 3 Women, top 3 Veteran, top 3 Cadet, and top 3 Junior fencers will be presented, if participation of these groups is large enough.\r\n\r\nMeadlists from this and the 2012 Powerade State Games Fencing competition are eligible to compete in the State Games of America on August 3-4, in Harrisburg, PA.\r\n \r\n*For the Women, Veteran, Cadet, and Junior fencers there may be a separate event if there are 8 or more participants that qualify. The final determination will be made based off of the entries received and athlete requests. If a separate event is held for any of these categories, then the awards will be given to the top three finishers with two bronze medals awarded just as with the Open and Y12 events. The separate events will be held concurrent with the open events, with the open events taking precedence. Direct any questions to the competition manager listed below.\r\n \r\nRobert Thomas - 910-409-7011 or blueline167@msn.com\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 01\/17\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/21\/2013.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Lake Norman Charter Middle School gym","address":"12435 Old Statesville Road","city":"Huntersville","state":"NC","zip":"28078","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":35.3702277,"longitude":-80.8313996,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":59,"name":"North Carolina","abbrev":"NC","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":86960,"tournament_id":21205,"tournament":"Powerade State Games of North Carolina","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":36,"prereg_count":52,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-22T13:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":86961,"tournament_id":21205,"tournament":"Powerade State Games of North Carolina","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-22T08:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":86962,"tournament_id":21205,"tournament":"Powerade State Games of North Carolina","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":5,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-22T08:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":86963,"tournament_id":21205,"tournament":"Powerade State Games of North Carolina","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y12MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-22T08:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":86964,"tournament_id":21205,"tournament":"Powerade State Games of North Carolina","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"A2","rating_prediction":"A2","entries":36,"prereg_count":38,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-22T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":86965,"tournament_id":21205,"tournament":"Powerade State Games of North Carolina","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B2","rating_prediction":"B2","entries":31,"prereg_count":35,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-22T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22741,"name":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC ","start_date":"2013-06-22","end_date":"","comments":"See \"More Info\" for eligibility, format, and fee details.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 8 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you're not sure how to do that, click on the Email the Tournament Organizer\u009d link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why do this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00a6 it's not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  That's the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence.   \r\n\r\n \r\nPre-registration closes 24 hours prior to the event.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":91759,"tournament_id":22741,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC ","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":8,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-06-22T16:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":22233,"name":"LFA OPEN Men's Sabre Pre-Nationals Tune-up","start_date":"2013-06-22","end_date":"","comments":"USFA sanctioned event.

Participants must follow all orders and instructions from these safety officers or they will be black carded and asked to leave.\r\n\r\nWe will try to do the fencing portion of the competition first before it gets too hot. The order of the rifle and archery competitions are not yet determined.\r\n\r\nRiflery:\r\n- Shooting will be with .22 caliber rifles only.\r\n- You may bring your own .22 rifle or you can use the range rifle.\r\n- Bullets will be supplied by MVC-BSA.\r\n- Target distance is 50 feet.\r\n- You will be allowed to shoot 5 practice shots at a practice target before the scored target shooting takes place.\r\n- You will shoot 10 shots into a target with 10 concentric rings. The outer ring is worth 1 point. The inner ring is worth 10 points. A shot that 'breaks' the line between two rings will be scored at the higher level.

If there is no hole that arrow will be scored a zero.\r\n- A misfire may be re-shot ONLY if the arrow falls within the reach of the competitor. If the competitor would have to leave the firing line to reach the arrow that shot will be scored as zero.\r\n- You will have a maximum of 10 minutes to shoot the scored target.\r\n\r\nFoil:\r\n- Foil fencing will be electric scored.\r\n- Format is normal USFA rules. One round of pools followed by Direct Elimination round.\r\n- 3rd place tie WILL be fenced off.\r\n- Points awarded based upon finish position. The number of points per place will be determined once we know how many competitors enter. First place is worth 100 points. If we have 10 competitors, tenth place will be worth 10 points. If we have 5 competitors, fifth place will be worth 20 points. If we have 20 competitors, twentieth place will be worth 5 points.\r\n- You must bring your own gear.\r\n- We are fencing outside in the grass.\r\n- WEAR SHOES WITH GOOD TREAD - FENCING SHOES ARE TOO SLIPPERY!\r\n\r\nVictory and tie break formula:\r\n- The highest point total across the three weapons is the winner.\r\n- It is possible a competitor might not finish first in any of the three individual competitions and yet still win the overall.\r\n- In case of a points total tie, the winner will be determined using the touch indicator values from the foil fencing portion of the competition.\r\n\r\nNot USFA.
