You can pay by paypal for a single month, for all three months, or subscribe to pay monthly for three months.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to come for open bouting any night we are having bouting. Since we're offering at least two nights per week for each weapon this can save you money over the floor fee.\r\n\r\nSo if you're looking to get some bouting in, whether your club is available or not, we wanted to make this option available to people in the community, to get good bouting with cool people from various clubs in a nice setting.\r\n\r\nLinks are included for the floor fee, or the discounted associate membership option.\r\n\r\nAssociate Single Month Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DKRMZMFHQD232\r\n\r\nAssociate Three Months Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PT5P6H55MFWPN\r\n\r\nAssociate Member 3 Month Subscription Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZTSKC3QUDBRFQ\r\n\r\nFloor Fee Single Night\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RCKLX79XB7C2L\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Limit 13 fencers Foil\r\n\r\nSafety Measures\r\n\r\n1.

Masks are not required during fencing activity. I have worn my mask while giving some lessons but not for bouting, and wearing it during the activity was fine. So if fencers are more comfortable wearing a mask while drilling and doing physical activity that is an option they can elect.\r\n\r\n6.       Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.  \r\n\r\n7.       We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11.   We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway.

We understand a lot of clubs aren't active during COVID re-opening, and people are going from place to place. We have an associate membership for people who want to fence here while retaining a primary membership elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNormally it's $60 per month if you're committed to 12 months.\r\n\r\nFor August, September and October we're discounting it to $45. You can pay by paypal for a single month, for all three months, or subscribe to pay monthly for three months.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to come for open bouting any night we are having bouting. Since we're offering at least two nights per week for each weapon this can save you money over the floor fee.\r\n\r\nSo if you're looking to get some bouting in, whether your club is available or not, we wanted to make this option available to people in the community, to get good bouting with cool people from various clubs in a nice setting.\r\n\r\nLinks are included for the floor fee, or the discounted associate membership option.\r\n\r\nAssociate Single Month Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DKRMZMFHQD232\r\n\r\nAssociate Three Months Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PT5P6H55MFWPN\r\n\r\nAssociate Member 3 Month Subscription Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZTSKC3QUDBRFQ\r\n\r\nFloor Fee Single Night\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RCKLX79XB7C2L\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\n\r\nSafety Measures\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for the summer camp instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks are not required during fencing activity. I have worn my mask while giving some lessons but not for bouting, and wearing it during the activity was fine. So if fencers are more comfortable wearing a mask while drilling and doing physical activity that is an option they can elect.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14. We will limit capacity in changing rooms to also maintain social distancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/17\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 07\/20\/2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Palasz","address":"1120 N Rolling Rd","city":"Catonsville","state":"MD","zip":"21228","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.2881568,"longitude":-76.7533178,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184325,"tournament_id":46881,"tournament":"Friday Open Epee Bouting","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-09-18T20:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":46923,"name":"Atlantic - Youth Saber Series #1 OUTDOOR","start_date":"2020-09-18","end_date":"","comments":"This saber series is specially designed to help young fencers to better understand  tournaments, and get comfortable competing.

All COVID Safety Measures required\r\n\r\nFencers must create teams of 3 fencers, they may optionally include 1 alternate.\r\n\r\nFor pools fencers assign their strongest fencer to their A spot, their mid fencer to their B spot, and their weakest to their C spot. \r\n\r\nAll A spot fencers fence in a pool, B slot fencers in a pool, and C slot fencers in a pool. The number of bout victories each team has from pools will seed the DE bracket. \r\n\r\nThe top 2 A pool fencers, top B pool fencer, and top C pool fencer will also advance to an individual championship round. \r\n\r\nDEs will be fenced in the bracket using a best of 9 five-touch bout format. Example, Team 1 versus Team 4, each fencer fences a five touch bout against each fencer on the other team. The first team to win 5 bouts wins and advances to the next round. \r\n\r\nIf an alternate is present the alternate must be subbed in permanently in the pool round. No fencer may fence in more than one slot (A,B,C). Any substitution eliminates both the substituted fencer and the substitute from the individual championship round. \r\n\r\nSubstitutions may be in and out in the DE round so long as no fencer fences the same person twice. Substitutions must be announced at least one bout before the bout where the substitution will occur.\r\n\r\nDuring DEs each team is allowed 1 time out of 30 seconds per bout. Time outs may be called between \"halt\" and \"fence\" but not during fencing action. \r\n\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Team Epee Mixed Team Foil Mixed Team Saber\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/07\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/19\/2020.\r\n\r\nSafety Measures  \r\n\r\nBaltimore County is now requiring masks for all indoor activities therefore masks will be worn throughout practice. We have the Leon Paul fencing mask inserts (compatible with all masks) available on site for $2.\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for the summer camp instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks ARE required during fencing activity. I have worn my mask while giving some lessons and wearing it during the activity was fine. \r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14. We will limit capacity in changing rooms to also maintain social distancing.

We understand a lot of clubs aren't active during COVID re-opening, and people are going from place to place. We have an associate membership for people who want to fence here while retaining a primary membership elsewhere.\r\n\r\nNormally it's $60 per month if you're committed to 12 months.\r\n\r\nFor August, September and October we're discounting it to $45. You can pay by paypal for a single month, for all three months, or subscribe to pay monthly for three months.\r\n\r\nThis allows you to come for open bouting any night we are having bouting. Since we're offering at least two nights per week for each weapon this can save you money over the floor fee.\r\n\r\nSo if you're looking to get some bouting in, whether your club is available or not, we wanted to make this option available to people in the community, to get good bouting with cool people from various clubs in a nice setting.\r\n\r\nLinks are included for the floor fee, or the discounted associate membership option.\r\n\r\nAssociate Single Month Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=DKRMZMFHQD232\r\n\r\nAssociate Three Months Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=PT5P6H55MFWPN\r\n\r\nAssociate Member 3 Month Subscription Discounted\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=ZTSKC3QUDBRFQ\r\n\r\nFloor Fee Single Night\r\nhttps:\/\/www.paypal.com\/cgi-bin\/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=RCKLX79XB7C2L\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\n\r\nSafety Measures\r\n\r\n1. We're only allowing quarter capacity for the summer camp instead of the recommended half capacity.\r\n\r\n2. We have a germicidal fogger to clean the club.\r\n\r\n3. We have bulk industrial size bottles of hand sanitizer spread throughout the club.\r\n\r\n4. Touchless antibacterial soap dispensers and touchless paper towel dispensers are in the bathrooms. There are now four bathrooms available instead of just the one.\r\n\r\n5. We are requiring masks as people enter the club, and when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re leaving the club. Masks are not required during fencing activity. I have worn my mask while giving some lessons but not for bouting, and wearing it during the activity was fine. So if fencers are more comfortable wearing a mask while drilling and doing physical activity that is an option they can elect.\r\n\r\n6. Social distancing will be encouraged and maintained outside of drill activities and fencing. We will avoid drills and games with high contact components.\r\n\r\n7. We are not permitting spectators or visitors during club activities in order to keep the number of people in the space low. Parents are encouraged to drop off fencers for activities rather than to remain at the club.\r\n\r\n\r\n11. We have set up a system at entry to avoid people congregating in the entryway. It directs people to hand sanitizer and a sign in log when they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re entering the club.\r\n\r\n12. We are maintaining a sign in log to track who is at the club when.\r\n\r\n13. We have two water bottle filling stations so fencers can safely get water without using the traditional water fountain.\r\n\r\n14. We will limit capacity in changing rooms to also maintain social distancing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 07\/17\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 07\/20\/2020.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Salle Palasz","address":"1120 N Rolling Rd","city":"Catonsville","state":"MD","zip":"21228","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.2881568,"longitude":-76.7533178,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":28,"name":"Maryland","abbrev":"MD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184624,"tournament_id":46988,"tournament":"Friday Open Epee Bouting","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-10-02T20:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47004,"name":"Ivan Lee's Sabre Round Robin","start_date":"2020-10-02","end_date":"","comments":"Sabre Round Robin\r\n- admission capped at 25 fencers\r\n- $30, members and A rated fencers fence free of charge\r\n- must register for entry, no walk-ins accepted","prereg_open":"2020-09-26","prereg_close":"2020-10-02","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Sabre Round Robin\r\n- admission capped at 25 fencers\r\n- $30, members and A rated fencers fence free of charge\r\n- must register for entry, no walk-ins accepted\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Saber\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/26\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/02\/2020 by 5pm.","venue":{"name":"Long Island Fencing Center","address":"1 Old Country Rd # LL08","city":"Carle Place","state":"NY","zip":"11514","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7427857,"longitude":-73.6216962,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":41,"name":"Long Island","abbrev":"LI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184655,"tournament_id":47004,"tournament":"Ivan Lee's Sabre Round Robin","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":8,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-10-02T18:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":47005,"name":"LIFC Epee Round Robin","start_date":"2020-10-02","end_date":"","comments":"Epee Round Robin\r\n- admission capped at 30 fencers\r\n- $30, members and A rated fencers fence free of charge\r\n- must register for entry, no walk-ins accepted","prereg_open":"2020-09-26","prereg_close":"2020-10-02","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Epee Round Robin\r\n- admission capped at 30 fencers\r\n- $30, members and A rated fencers fence free of charge\r\n- must register for entry, no walk-ins accepted\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nMixed Epee\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/26\/2020.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/02\/2020 by 4pm","venue":{"name":"Long Island Fencing Center","address":"1 Old Country Road #LL08","city":"Carle Place","state":"NY","zip":"11514","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.7427857,"longitude":-73.6216962,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":41,"name":"Long Island","abbrev":"LI","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":184656,"tournament_id":47005,"tournament":"LIFC Epee Round Robin","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":17,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-10-02T18:30:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":46936,"name":"Apex Novice Cup - Youth & Senior Foil\/Epee","start_date":"2020-10-03","end_date":"2020-10-04","comments":"This tournament has been modified due to Covid restrictions, please read INFO page. \r\n \r\nPre-registration for AFA fencers closes 9\/27\/20.\r\n\r\nRegistration for non AFA fencers opens 9\/28\/20 and closes 9\/30\/20\r\n","prereg_open":"2020-09-14","prereg_close":"2020-09-30","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Special Tournament conditions due to Covid19\r\n\r\nIn order to allow us to follow the Covid safety guidelines and keep our fencers and families safe during the tournament, we will need to make some changes to how we run these events.
