Open to fencers born 2005 or earlier. Medals and classifications will be awarded.\r\n\r\nOn August 6th, 2016, the Bucks County Academy of Fencing suffered the sudden and unexpected loss of one of the longest established members of our coaching staff, Mitch Davis. After starting fencing in high school, Mitch joined the BCAF as a student in the mid 1980's and had been a member of the BCAF coaching staff for over 25 years.  He was a kind and caring man who inspired his students with his infectious enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mitch was an avid Revolutionary War historian and re-enactor.  His passion for both fencing and history touched many lives in both communities and sparked a life-long interest in many young people.  \r\n \r\nWith this competition, we honor his memory.\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

Free wireless internet!\r\n\r\n10 minute walk on scenic tow path to historic Lambertville full of shops & dining!\r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO KEEP ACCEPTING ENTRY FEES AT THE DOOR AND TO HELP KEEP THE NUMBER OF NO-SHOWS TO A MINIMUM, BCAF WILL BE INSTITUTING THE FOLLOWING POLICY FOR THE 2018-2019 SEASON:\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF-Lambertville Pre-registration Policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 3\/13\/17. BALANCE DUE AT DOOR (CASH ONLY).<\/b>\r\n\r\n***Exact change is always appreciated***\r\n\r\nUse the link in your confirmation e-mail or write to the organizers to delete your pre-registration if you do not plan to attend this event.\r\n\r\n<b>$50 at the door for late registrations (after 3\/13\/17) and walk-ins (CASH ONLY). <\/b>\r\n\r\nA-rated fencers get a $10 discount!\r\n\r\nMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nWOMEN'S FOIL: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nDirections can be found at: http:\/\/www.bcaf.com\/contact_lambertville.html \r\n\r\n<b>** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of USA Fencing and other applicable rules instituted by BCAF.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.

If there are at least 5 girls and 5 boys, we will separate the event by gender. Medals will be given to the top 4 boys and top 4 girls in each event.\r\n\r\nThis is part of a series of beginner youth tournaments meant to be used to teach athletes and PARENTS about the format for tournaments and how to help your fencers be successful.  Future dates are April 27 and May 11.\r\n\r\nFencers must be competitive members of the USFA and have a properly signed North Texas Division waiver (attached) to participate. All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is a limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome!

There are no national points awarded at Regional Youth competitions. These competitions are one of the possible qualification paths for Youth 10 and Youth 12 events at both the March NAC and the Y10, Y12 and Y14 USA Fencing National Championships.\r\n\r\nA Regional Ranking Point System (RRPS) is in place to recognize participation and accomplishment of developing athletes at the regional level and will serve as a qualification path to the Summer National Championships. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes who have fenced at an RYC will earn points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement. At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 youth regions will be recognized by the YDC and US Fencing. For more details on this initiative, refer to the Regional Youth Recognition Initiative document here: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6318\/Regional_Youth_Recognition_Initiative__1_.pdf\r\n\r\nNAC\/Nationals Qualification through the RYC points list:\r\n\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as a qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth NAC and for Y10, Y12 and Y14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\n\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament prior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be considered eligible to compete.

There are a number of food options near our club.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION CLOSES promptly at 11AM. Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED.  $25 at the door.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $20 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\nThis is a fully sanctioned USFA event. All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2018-2019 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership. Go to http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership to join.\r\n\r\nFull USFA regulation uniform is required including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. A foil mask with conductive bib and mask cord are required. Foil fencers who wear a hard plastic chest protector must use the new FIE-approved padded protector. Chest protectors are still required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.  Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.\r\n\r\nAGE ELIGIBILITY: This tournament is open to fencers born in 2005 or earlier\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"8629 S Tacoma Way","city":"Lakewood","state":"WA","zip":"98499","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.1787504,"longitude":-122.4830092,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":171512,"tournament_id":43197,"tournament":"MTFC Senior Mixed Epee","full_name":"Senior Mixed Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":9,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2019-03-23T11:00:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":42433,"name":"Utah Cup #3 (Youth and High School)","start_date":"2019-03-23","end_date":"","comments":"Entry fees: $65 for league membership or $20 per cup.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss <b>ONCE<\/b> without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\n<b>Starting with the 2018-2019 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.<\/b>\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n \r\nYou may compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nMIXED \"U\" FOIL:  10:00 AM close of check-in\r\nMIXED \"U\" EPEE:  1:00 PM close of check-in\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. <b>You MUST show your USA Fencing card at the door.<\/b> Print your card when you join\/renew your membership.

USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usafencing.org. Use your credit card number on the renewal form for your USA Fencing membership payment. Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper. \r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\n<b>PLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2018, all foil fencers who wear a rigid chest protector (some men, and ALL women) will need to wear the new padded design. The chest protector will also need to be worn UNDER the plastron.<\/b>\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.
