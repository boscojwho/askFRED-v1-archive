A $10.00 late fee will be charged if you register at the door. Must be a current USFA member. Proper fencing attire is required.\r\n\r\n--- Format Details --- For Open Events ---\r\n\r\n1st round of pools, seeded normally. 100% promotion from the 1st round. The top 6-7 after the 1st round of pools are placed into a \"Shark\" pool.\r\n\r\n2nd round of pools seeded based on the results of the 1st round, with the \"sharks\" removed. \r\n\r\nDEs are a tableau of 12\/16\/24, depending on event size. \"Sharks\" are guaranteed the top 1-7 seeds in the DE table. The remaining spots are filled by fencers from the \"minnows\" pools.\r\n\r\nAdvantages: More fencing for everybody! Top fencers get more quality bouts. Developmental fencers have to earn the opportunity to fence DEs, but do it against their peers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=9897\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/21\/2009\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $4.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc [at] gmail [dot] com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.268185,"longitude":-123.249992,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":41038,"tournament_id":9437,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2009","full_name":"Senior Women's Epee","short_name":"SrWE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":9,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-10-24T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":41041,"tournament_id":9437,"tournament":"Halloween Slash and Stab 2009","full_name":"Senior Men's Epee","short_name":"SrME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":19,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-10-24T10:30:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9187,"name":"Clinton Fencing Dirty Rat Foil Open","start_date":"2009-10-24","end_date":"","comments":"Events Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSenior Mixed Foil Open 1:30PM\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/18\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/23\/2009.\r\n\r\n","prereg_open":"2009-08-18","prereg_close":"2009-10-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Dirty Rat Foil Open\r\nSaturday, October 24th 2009\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Mixed Foil 1:30PM\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/18\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/23\/2009.\r\n\r\nPre-registration with payment - $35.\r\nPre-registration and pay at the door - $40.\r\nRegister at door (subject to space available) - $45\r\nNo refunds after 10\/17\/09\r\n\r\nMixed Foil - 1:30pm (limited to first 40 fencers).
