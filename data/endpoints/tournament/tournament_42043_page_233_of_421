How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $65 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! As long as there are at least 4 athletes the event will run.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\nThis is an official USFA-sanctioned event. Current USFA membership and full regulation uniform required.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking on street (just not Lancaster).  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. \r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3851  Warren  Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9608254,"longitude":-75.1995622,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113931,"tournament_id":28765,"tournament":"FAP Y12 Novice Foil NON-ELECTRIC","full_name":"Unrated Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":1,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T16:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":29021,"name":"MTFC 'E' and Under Foil","start_date":"2015-01-31","end_date":"","comments":"MTFC is pleased to announce this open foil event; space is limited register early.

The event fee ($15) is refundable for no-shows and withdrawals.\r\n\r\nNo late registrations or event entries will be accepted at the door!  All payments must be made by midnight January 23, 2015.  Fencers listed as incomplete for any event on AskFRED.net at that time will not be allowed to fence in the event(s) indicated.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT CHECK-IN (Per USFA RYC guideline revisions \u0096 September 19, 2014)\r\n\r\nYouth fencers must check-in with their USFA membership card or a letter of good standing, showing current competitive membership.  Athletes without proof of membership must fill out all appropriate forms to pay for membership.  Payment will be returned if membership can be verified. \r\n\r\nParents should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age needs verification for eligibility purposes: \r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included \r\n2. A copy of birth certificate \r\n3. Passport \r\n\r\nNote: Once date of birth is verified by the USFA National Office, it is indicated on permanent and temporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nIf you (the fencer) join the USFA at the venue, and are not listed on their official list, you will compete as an unrated fencer to avoid the risk of invalidating your event.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCHEDULE POLICY\r\n\r\nNote that the posted time for each event is the close of check-in for that event.  If all fencers for an event have checked in early, that event may start early (given availability of strips, referees, and readiness of the fencers to begin).  \r\n\r\nThe listed mixed events will be split by gender as needed on the day of the tournament.  Per USFA RYC guidelines, events must be split by gender into separate male and female events if 5 or more males and 5 or more females are entered for the same weapon by age-group.  \r\n\r\nPer the Athlete's Handbook, at least 2 participants must compete in an event.  There is no auto-qualify for a single entry.  There will be 100% promotion to direct elimination.  Per USFA RYC guidelines, all events must have both a pool round for seeding and direct elimination.  Thus, in the case of just 2 competitors in an event, the competitors would fence each other twice to determine the final results.\r\n\r\nAWARDS\r\n\r\nIf 10 or more fencers compete in an event, medals will be awarded to all 8 finalists; otherwise, medals will be awarded for first through third places (with no fence-off required for third place).  \r\n\r\nFor mixed events, no distinction will be made in medal awards based upon the gender of any fencer - only the final placement in the event. \r\n\r\n\r\nCONDUCT POLICY\r\n\r\nZERO TOLERANCE FOR POOR CONDUCT. This applies to every person in the venue. Staff members deserve respect and appreciation for doing a tough job for which few volunteer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFETY AND EQUIPMENT POLICY\r\n\r\nFull fencing attire is required, as specified in the paragraph 2.6 (page 31) of the USFA Athlete Handbook (which can be accessed and downloaded at the USFA link under \u0093Other Sites.\u0094  Select \u0093Athlete Handbook,\u0094 under \u0093Manuals,\u0094 under the \u0093About\u0094 tab at the USFA link ).  Thus, for Y10 events, the maximum blade length permitted is 32.5 inches.  Names on uniforms are not required for RYC competitions.  \r\n\r\nDuring the initial equipment inspection at check-in, masks, body cords, and head cords will be tested and marked (stamp on mask, colored tape or other mark on cords) to show they pass inspection. Other equipment and uniforms will be inspected upon reporting to the strip for the round of pools and again for each direct elimination bout.  \r\n\r\nLack of the tournament inspection mark will result in an immediate penalty touch (Group 2 RED card) for that bout.  This applies, even if the inspection mark applied falls off of a previously inspected and marked body or head cord.  It is the fencer\u0092s responsibility to ensure the inspection mark remains affixed to the cords throughout the tournament, and this lack of mark cannot be argued with the referee.  If the inspection mark falls off, before reporting to the strip for the pool or for each direct elimination bout, the fencer must either switch to use the required back-up cord or return to the armorer to have the cord in question be re-tested and marked anew without delaying the start of the bout.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Dunedin Fencing Club","address":"1920 Pinehurst Road","city":"Dunedin","state":"FL","zip":"34698","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.0370796,"longitude":-82.7726464,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113222,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y10MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":113223,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":113224,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y12MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":12,"prereg_count":12,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":113225,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y12 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y12MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":9,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T12:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":113228,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":18,"prereg_count":18,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T12:00:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":113229,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y14 Men's Foil","short_name":"Y14MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":16,"prereg_count":21,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":113230,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-31T08:30:00-05:00","fee":"15.00"},{"id":115180,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y14 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y14WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":115181,"tournament_id":28575,"tournament":"Region 6 Central Florida RYC","full_name":"Y12 Women's Foil","short_name":"Y12WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":11,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27811,"name":"Saturday Senior Open Epee & Sabre","start_date":"2015-01-31","end_date":"","comments":"FAD will be hosting Mixed Open Epee & Sabre events; We will try to make this an \"A\" tournament.

Check or cash only.\r\n\r\nPre registration opens on 12\/11\/14.\r\nPre registration closes on 01\/30\/2015.\r\n\r\nFYI: Team Events:\r\nTeam competition involves teams of three fencers. A fourth fencer can be allowed on the team as an alternate, but as soon as the fourth has been subbed in, they cannot leave and must fence to the completion of the event. The opposing team must be alerted of this substitution at least one round before it happens.\r\n\r\nThe modern team competition is similar to the pool round of the individual competition. The fencers from opposing teams will each fence each other once, making for a total of nine matches. At the beginning of the team match, each team fills out one side of a score sheet with the order they will fence in. Teams are not aware of the order their opponents will be fencing in, although the sheet is designed so that no two athletes will fence each other twice.\r\n\r\nMatches (or bouts) between teams are three minutes long, or to 5 points, as in the pools. There are important differences, however: each match the score carries over, and the maximum score for each match is increased by 5. For example, lets imagine that Fencer A from Team 1 and Fencer X from Team 2 finish their first bout at 5-3. Next, Fencer B and Fencer Y step on the piste. They will be fencing to 10 points, but Fencer B starts at 5, and Fencer Y starts at 3, right where their team-mates left them. This means that Fencer Y can still pull ahead, if she scores 7 points before Fencer B scores 5.\r\n\r\nImagine, however, things go slowly, and after three minutes the total score is 8-6. Although neither fencer reached the limit of 10 total points for this match, the next pair to fence will still be able to go as high as 15. In other words, the maximum score for each round continues increasing by 5 regardless of how many points were scored in the previous match.\r\n\r\nSince there are 9 matches, the highest score possible is 45 points. However, the winner is simply the team with the highest score at the end of the ninth match, even if it is less than 45. While sabre almost inevitably goes to 45, it is not unusual to see an \u00e9p\u00e9e score in the mid to low thirties. If there is a tie at the end of the ninth match, then the usual tie-breaking rules apply, and it is the same two fencers who will do the tie-breaker match.\r\n\r\nTeam tournaments sometimes use pools and elimination rounds, although this is not so common, and they usually begin in a direct elimination format. The seeding of the teams in this case can be random, or based on the performance of the individual members (if it is a tournament with both), or even based on the results of the same team at other tournaments (for example if it is a national team). \r\n\r\nFor more info, read Chapter 6 of the USFA Rule Book.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Lebanon YMCA Fencing Club","address":"","city":"Lebanon","state":"PA","zip":"17042","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.2927633,"longitude":-76.3868797,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":27,"name":"Harrisburg","abbrev":"HARR","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":113505,"tournament_id":28650,"tournament":"Lebanon Y Unsanctioned Epee Team Event","full_name":"Unsanctioned Senior Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"SrMxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":9,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2015-01-24T09:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28911,"name":"Ohio HS OPEN Scrimmage","start_date":"2015-01-31","end_date":"","comments":"This team scrimmage is open to all U19 fencers from the states of OH, IN, MI, KY, PA, and IL.  \r\n","prereg_open":"2015-01-11","prereg_close":"2015-01-29","authority":"NONE","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Ohio High School Invitational team scrimmage is open to all U19 fencers from the states of OH, IN, MI, KY, PA, and IL.  \r\n\r\nPREPARE TO FENCE A LOT! \r\n\r\nParticipants will be seeded based on their USFA Classification and level of experience, and assigned to a team.

If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for ZFA events for the next calendar year.

If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair.

In exceptional cases, the tournament organizers may waive this limitation.  Please contact egrass@me.com or dsapery@gmail.com with any questions.\r\n\r\nCHECK-IN REQUIREMENTS FOR THE DAY OF EACH EVENT\r\nThe competition portion of the venue will open for fencers at 7:00am each day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nFencers must check in each day that they compete, within the indicated hours of check-in, or they will be withdrawn from that event. \r\n\r\nIN ORDER TO COMPETE YOU MUST CHECK-IN AT THE COMPETITION FLOOR OF THE VENUE BEFORE THE LISTED DEADLINE WITH THE FOLLOWING IN HAND:\r\n1) the fencer is required to show a USA Fencing membership card (valid for the current competitive season); AND\r\n2) the fencer is required to provide a fully-completed waiver form that has been signed by a parent or legal guardian; AND\r\n3) the fencer is required to show a birth-certificate (copy acceptable) or other government-issued identification showing a birth date <B>UNLESS THEIR MEMBERSHIP CARD INDICATES THAT THE BIRTHYEAR IS VERIFIED<\/B>.\r\n\r\nTo help us speed registration, please download the waiver form, print it, read it, sign it, and bring it to the table with you. This is especially critical if the fencer does not have a parent\/guardian at check-in.  No one will be allowed to fence without a signed waiver form.\r\n\r\nWaiver Form .PDF --> http:\/\/goo.gl\/lmSwGb\r\n\r\nNew USA Fencing memberships and new or replacement USA Fencing cards should be obtained through the USA Fencing website before the tournament. http:\/\/goo.gl\/of17o\r\n\r\nAthletes arriving without proof of USA Fencing membership must fill out all appropriate forms and pay for membership at registration even if already a member.  Refund requests can later be made with USA Fencing as appropriate. \r\n\r\nFencers who fail to register by the published deadline will be removed from the event and refunds will not be made.\r\n\r\nNote that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded.  Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nUNIFORMS REQUIREMENTS\r\nAll USA Fencing uniform requirements apply. NAMES ARE NOT REQUIRED ON THE UNIFORM. Conductive bibs are required in all foil events.\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT REQUIREMENTS AND INSPECTIONS\r\nY10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches. Parents and fencers are advised that blades marketed as \"#0\" or \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however blades labeled as #0 or #2 but are longer than 32.5 inches, are not permitted.\r\n\r\nEquipment check will be open each day of the competition at 7:00 am. Equipment check will test the mask, lame jacket and foil mask bib, gloves and body cords, as well as any French grip weapons. Items that have passed inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\" All events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary check will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE bout to ensure the presence of: Underarm plastron, 2nd weapon and body cord, weapon check control marks.  Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met.\r\n\r\nWeapons with grips other than French will not be inspected or marked in advance. Regardless, failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nParents and fencers should expect significant lines for equipment check between 7-8am on Saturday and Sunday. Please plan accordingly.  Those fencing Saturday or Sunday can have their equipment checked Friday anytime after 10am.\r\n\r\nNote that Absolute Fencing will be on site to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order. \r\n\r\nPOINTS, RATINGS AND SEEDING\r\n\r\nSeeding for the Youth events is based on current national rolling point standings according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking within year classification. Seeding for the Cadet events follows USA Fencing standard practice in which top 16 ranked fencers are seeded first, then by Cadet ranking within each letter classification, then by classification year. Fencers with equal classification will be randomized among themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Capitol Clash will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. You can check your USA Fencing rating by downloading and searching for your name here -- http:\/\/goo.gl\/uWUML. You can check your points here -- http:\/\/goo.gl\/FfQ1D\r\n\r\nThis information will be obtained from USA Fencing on Friday, January 30. Any discrepancies regarding classifications or points earned must be resolved by this date.\r\n\r\nEach event's tentative seeding will be posted at the venue prior to the close of check-in. It will also be posted at http:\/\/live.capitolclash.com.\r\n\r\nIt is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies before the close of check-in and before pools are posted.\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION INFORMATION HIGHLIGHTS\r\n\r\nFailure to report to a strip timely for the start of a bout subjects the fencer to disqualification according to USA Fencing rules.\r\n\r\nNo flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. Be advised that we expect to have press and other media at this event and to have video, photography, and sound recordings being made.  The waiver form includes a release regarding this.\r\n\r\nREGISTRATION INFORMATION, DEADLINES, COSTS:\r\n\r\nRegistration fees (including all convenience fees and costs to register online and pay with a credit card) follow, with listed deadlines:\r\n\r\nRegular online registration period runs through January 11, 2015\r\n$40 Registration plus $30 per event\r\n\r\nFrom January 12, 2015 through February 1, 2015\r\nTRIPLE FEES\r\n$120 registration plus $90 per event\r\n\r\nRegistration will close at midnight after January 11 but will re-open on January 12 for late registrations.\r\n\r\nAfter February 1, no registration can be done through AskFRED.

For more information, contact DESF at desfcg@aol.com or 207-974-8461. \r\n\r\nDESF Practice Tournaments: These practice events may be conducted non-electrically with judges, or with electric equipment depending on availability.

These fees only apply to DESF hosted tournaments.

All volunteer donations to the referee fund are welcome and highly appreciated to help pay or discount the entry fees of those who volunteer to referee. When appropriate, incentives (i.e., discounted entry fees) will be offered to encourage additional participation in low turnout events to increase fencing opportunities. The tournament manager reserves the right to determine the type and amount of these incentives on an individual event basis.\r\n\r\nAwards:\r\nMedals for the top three finishers will be given for each event. Any classifications in USFA Events will be awarded according to USFA tournament rules and conditions.\r\n\r\nVenue:\r\nJewett School & Community Center Gymnasium\r\n66 Bridge Street\r\nBucksport, Maine 04416\r\nMap: http:\/\/g.co\/maps\/rwaff\r\nParking is behind and across street from school.

Teams will schedule their own matches with each other, and will have until <b>May 2nd<\/b> to compete matches and report results. In the event of 12 or more teams registering, the league coordinator will place the teams into two different geographically-based divisions (the ruling of the league coordinator in this instance is final and not subject to appeal). If Divisions are used, then each team will fence each team in each division as a \"Home\" and \"Visiting\" team, and will fence each other team in the other division once, with the league coordinator designating which matches will be \"Home\" and \"Visiting.\" Home teams are responsible for arranging for and payment of referees for all hosted matches.
