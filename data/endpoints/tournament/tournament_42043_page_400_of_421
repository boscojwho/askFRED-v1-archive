These are among the largest Vet Saber events in the country outside of the Veteran NACs. In addition to East Coast fencers, competitors have included attendees from as far away as Atlanta and Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis event is being held in conjunction with our <b>Pre-Season Vet Sabre Clinic with David Sierra.<\/b> The Theme of the Pre-Season Clinic will be <b>\"Problem Solving on Strip.\"<\/b> We will work on common scenarios that present themselves and how to overcome them including: dealing with highly offensive opponents, dealing with highly defensive opponents, opponents with a loud coach, referees that are making confusing calls, and internal mental breakdowns. There will be theoretical and role-playing scenarios, along with \"real world\" practical exercises and situations.

Each fencer will get credit for points earned at up to three 2022-2023 Cup events\r\n\r\n2. For each 2022-2023 Cup event, fencers will receive points based on their finish and letter ratings of other participants who finish below them:\r\na. Each fencer will be assigned a value based on their rating (A=7, B=6, C=5, D=4, E=3, U=2)\r\nb. Fencers will earn points equal to the sum of the point values of all fencers who finish below them, plus 2 points\r\nc. In the case of Vet XS, MS will earn points for all MS finishers below them; WS will earn points for all fencers (MS or WS) below them\r\n\r\n3.

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $50 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $60 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $75 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks, Venmo or Zelle for payments made at the door.

He was well-known in the sport of fencing, was a fencing master, and had a tremendous influence on fencing in New York, where he was years ahead of everyone else in the colored uniform trend.  He was a member of the 1948 Olympic saber squad, and in 1952, 1956, and 1960 the Olympic foil squads.   He coached at Salle Santelli, in Westchester high schools, and at CCNY. Among his former students were Tom Ciccarone, Craig Cummings, and Uriah Jones. In 2001 he was inducted into the US Fencing Hall of Fame.","venue":{"name":"Floyd Little Athletic Center","address":"480 Sherman Pkwy","city":"New Haven","state":"CT","zip":"06511","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.322996,"longitude":-72.9395228,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":39,"name":"Connecticut","abbrev":"CT","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":197443,"tournament_id":50676,"tournament":"Neil Lazar ROC (Div1A, Div2, Vet)","full_name":"Men's Foil","short_name":"MF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197778,"tournament_id":50676,"tournament":"Neil Lazar ROC (Div1A, Div2, Vet)","full_name":"Women's Foil","short_name":"WF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197779,"tournament_id":50676,"tournament":"Neil Lazar ROC (Div1A, Div2, Vet)","full_name":"Men's Epee","short_name":"ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197780,"tournament_id":50676,"tournament":"Neil Lazar ROC (Div1A, Div2, Vet)","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197781,"tournament_id":50676,"tournament":"Neil Lazar ROC (Div1A, Div2, Vet)","full_name":"Men's Saber","short_name":"MS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":197782,"tournament_id":50676,"tournament":"Neil Lazar ROC (Div1A, Div2, Vet)","full_name":"Women's Saber","short_name":"WS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":51459,"name":"Halberstadt Y10 Boys, Y10 Girls Foil","start_date":"2022-09-25","end_date":"","comments":"","prereg_open":"2022-08-31","prereg_close":"2022-09-23","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":true,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":true,"fee":0,"fee_currency":"USD","more_info":"Events Scheduled:\r\n\r\nDoors Open: 8am\r\nY10 Men's Foil: 9am\r\nY10 Women's Foil: 12pm\r\n\r\nEvent Fee: $40\r\nRegistration at the Door:$60\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 08\/31\/2022.\r\nPreregistration closes on 09\/23\/2022.","venue":{"name":"Halberstadt Fencers' Club","address":"621 S.
