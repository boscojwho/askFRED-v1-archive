If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords. All sanctioned foil events will require this equipment.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event.

minute periods.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and Junior event DE's will be a 15 point bout with three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events ail use #0 weapons.\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, Cadet and

entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\nTournament Rules:\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't have knickers, but NO baggy jeans or shorts allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\nFencing Equipment:\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\nWaivers:\r\nA Waiver of Liability Form must be signed by all participants or their legal guardians prior to the competition.\r\nWaiver Forms will be available at the registration table on the day of the tournament.\r\nFencers who are under the age of 18 will need to have their parent or legal guardian complete the form at the time of registration.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Queen of All Saints Elementary School

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. Fencers will be pulled in from the wait list in the order that their requests have been received. The current wait list for each event is at the bottom of the page. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for ZFA events for the next calendar year. This means that you won\u0092t be able to pre-register via AskFRED and you will have to compete as a walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nIf you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. \r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\nSenior Men's foil \u0096 9:00 am\r\nSenior Women's foil \u0096 12:00 pm\r\n\r\nPreregistration closes on 06\/07\/2015.\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Zeljkovic Fencing Academy.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nMIXED EPEE: 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required. You MUST show your USA Fencing card or have proof that payment has been made. You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have a separate check made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment. Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. \r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT will be at the discretion of the meet manager and announced prior to the start of the event. If separate men's and women's events are scheduled, they may be combined if there are fewer than six fencers in either event.
