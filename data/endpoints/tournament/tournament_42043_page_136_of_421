If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70492,"tournament_id":16654,"tournament":"Div. 3 Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":6,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-13T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":16697,"name":"F.F.A.

To help promote the pre-payment option, we have reduced our rate to $20 if you use the pre-payment method.  Please note, pre-payment is NON-REFUNDABLE and AskFred charges an extra $0.99 fee.  \r\n*For those who pre-register, please UN-REGISTER yourself or email\/call us if you cannot attend our events. Repeat offenders who no-call\/no-show will have a \"3 strikes\" policy per season. After the 3rd infringement, your registration will need pre-approval, and an additional fee of $10 will be collected and DONATED to the American Red Cross upon check-in.  \r\n\r\ne: hello[at]redstarfencing.com    \"@\" replaces [at]\r\np: +1 773 349 3074\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/21\/2011.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/11\/2011 at 11:59PM CDT.\r\n","venue":{"name":"REDSTAR FENCING CLUB","address":"3735 W BELMONT AVE","city":"CHICAGO","state":"IL","zip":"60618","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":41.9391015,"longitude":-87.7212411,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":33,"name":"Illinois","abbrev":"IL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":69442,"tournament_id":16357,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-13T08:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":69443,"tournament_id":16357,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Y12 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y12MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y12","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-13T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":69445,"tournament_id":16357,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":13,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-13T11:30:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"},{"id":69446,"tournament_id":16357,"tournament":"RedStar Fencing: Y10F, Y12F, Y14F, MxF & MxSabre","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":4,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-13T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"10.00"}]},{"id":15605,"name":"Orange Coast Division 3 Weapon Open","start_date":"2011-11-13","end_date":"","comments":"Everyone is invited to this three-weapon mixed open tournament.","prereg_open":"2011-09-19","prereg_close":"2011-11-12","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"The entry fee is $10.00 for each event payable at the door.\r\nWe are accepting pre-registration for this tournament, but not required.\r\n\r\nComplete division information, including maps and directions to venues, can be found on the Orange Coast Division's website at:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ocfencing.org\/directions.htm\r\n\r\n 9:00 am - Open Mixed Foil\r\n12:00 pm - Open Mixed Epee\r\n 2:00 pm - Open Mixed Sabre\r\n\r\n1.

Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.

Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that you can no longer pre-register.  Thats the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"3519 Lancaster Ave.","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.958543,"longitude":-75.192976,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":70666,"tournament_id":16702,"tournament":"Y10 Novice Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2011-11-19T15:30:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":15682,"name":"CMHS Midwest HS Invitational","start_date":"2011-11-19","end_date":"","comments":"Open to high school students, grades 9-12 only.
