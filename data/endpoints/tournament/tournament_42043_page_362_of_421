Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/current-point-standings\r\n\r\nRJCC - Current National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification, then classification and year.  If athlete has neither National Points nor a weapon classification they are seeded on a random basis with the other athletes in the same situation.\r\n\r\n* Each event consists of two rounds (pools and DE (direct elimination). \r\nPools: One preliminary round of 5 and 6 or 6 and 7 person pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to direct elimination round. \r\n\r\nDirect Elimination: DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. \r\nY10 DE format: 10-touch bouts (two 3-minuteperiods with a 1 minute break  between). The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nY12\/Y14 DE format:  15-touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break between) During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nCadet\/Junior DE format: 15-touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a 1 minute break between) During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\n* No fence-off for third place; Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n* Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal: \r\n* Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n* Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>QUALIFICATION PATHS <\/b>\r\n\r\nREGIONAL YOUTH CIRCUIT\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/ryc-resources\r\n\r\nREGIONAL JUNIOR\/CADET CIRCUIT\r\nhttps:\/\/www.usafencing.org\/rjcc-resources\r\n\r\n<b>NEARBY HOTELS<\/b>\r\nCrowne Plaza Suffern- Mahwah (1.8 miles)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.cpsuffernhotel.com\/\r\n3 Executive Blvd\r\n Suffern, NY 10901\r\n(845) 357-4800\r\n\r\nHampton Inn and Suites-Mahwah (4.7 miles)\r\nhttp:\/\/hamptoninn3.hilton.com\/en\/hotels\/new-jersey\/hampton-inn-and-suites-mahwah-MAHWHHX\/index.html\r\n290 Route 17 & Corporate Dr.\r\nMahwah, New Jersey, 07430\r\n(201) 828-2031\r\n\r\nFairfield Inn and Suites by Marriott-Mahwah (4.7 miles)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.marriott.com\/hotels\/travel\/ewrfm-fairfield-inn-and-suites-mahwah\/\r\n225 Ramapo Valley Road  \r\nMahwah,  New Jersey  07430  \r\n(201) 529-4000\r\n\r\nHampton Inn - Nanuet (4.0 miles)\r\nhttp:\/\/hamptoninn3.hilton.com\/en\/hotels\/new-york\/hampton-inn-nanuet-HPNNUHX\/index.html\r\n260 NY-59\r\nNanuet, NY 10954\r\n(845) 623-0900\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Rockland Community College","address":"145 College Rd","city":"Suffern","state":"NY","zip":"10901","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":41.1322451,"longitude":-74.0872476,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":44,"name":"Westchester-Rockland","abbrev":"WST-RCK","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":173465,"tournament_id":43828,"tournament":"Thrust Winter RYC\/RJCC","full_name":"Y10 Men's Epee","short_name":"Y10ME","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Men","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":"","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2020-02-09T08:00:00-05:00","fee":"100.00"}]},{"id":44600,"name":"BFC Choco Therapy","start_date":"2020-02-08","end_date":"2020-02-09","comments":"Proof of current 2019\/20 USA Fencing competitive membership required.

All events will be fenced using electric equipment. There is limited availability of equipment at FIT; fencers are allowed to share equipment as this is a BEGINNER tournament.\r\n\r\nThese tournaments are intended to be a child's first introduction to a fencing tournament environment, and are meant to prepare athletes for participation in the Regional Youth Circuit (RYC) and Super Youth Circuit (SYC) events. They are also a training ground for PARENTS and REFEREES. Parents are expected to ask questions throughout the tournament so you will be better prepared to help your child at a larger event.\r\n\r\nBeginning referees are welcome!

2003 or later\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Structure:<\/b>\r\nAll times are close of registration, fencing to commence immediately afterward.\r\nFencers may compete in only one event per session.\r\nY8 and Y10 event DE's will be a 10 point bout, of two 3 minute periods, with a 1 minute break at 5 hits (whichever comes first).\r\nY12, Y14, and Cadet event DE's will be a 15 point bout of three 3 minute periods.\r\nY8 events will use #0 weapons (TFA has some of these available).\r\nY10 events will use #2 weapons.\r\nY12, Y14, and Cadet events will use #5 weapons.\r\nY14 and Cadet events will require foil masks with bibs, head-wires and legal weapons.\r\nEvents require a minimum of 4 fencers to be run.\r\nEvents may be combined to fence mixed (boys and girls together) if there are not a minimum number of fencers of each gender.\r\n\r\n<b>Non-TFA Fencers:<\/b>\r\nThese tournaments are part of TFA's training programs.\r\nNon-TFA fencers should email the organizer to request registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\nRegistered members of TFA's training programs pay a $20 entry fee per event.\r\nFencers from other clubs pay a $25 entry fee per event at registration.\r\n\r\n<b>Tournament Rules:<\/b>\r\nSome of the items mentioned below may seem obvious, but since we are dealing with kids at a public venue, safety is utmost.\r\nAll fencers will be required to:\r\n* wear a fencing jacket, fencing pants with long socks, plastron, chest protector (must for girls), mask and a glove in good condition.\r\n* wear sweats or track pants if they don't yet have proper fencing knickers, but NO JEANS OR SHORTS allowed.\r\n* wear decent, well fitting NON-MARKING runners.\r\n* wear proper-sized, tucked-in t-shirts to insure that there isn't any skin showing between jacket edges and pants.\r\n* use well-maintained weapons in good operating condition.\r\n\r\n<b>CFF Licenses:<\/b>\r\nAll participating fencers in Y12 and above events will be required to have their CFF license (or foreign equivalent) for liability reasons.\r\nLicenses can be purchased at:  http:\/\/fencing.ca\/purchase-a-cff-licence\/\r\n\r\n<b>Fencing Equipment:<\/b>\r\nIf kids have their own basic gear or can borrow some from their club, that's great.\r\nWe will have some basic equipment available to borrow like: masks, jackets, chest protectors, plastrons and gloves.\r\nIf kids do not have their own equipment we can lend gear for their use during the day, but there is no guarantee that they won't have to share sweaty stuff between them.\r\nElectrical gear is always an issue, so anything that can be brought from other clubs will be great.\r\nWe will have some electrical gear available to borrow: foils, head-wires, body-wires and lames.\r\n\r\n<b>Questions:<\/b>\r\nContact Brad Kelly at 604-506-1356 or brad@tri-cityfencing.com","venue":{"name":"Pitt Meadows Heritage Hall","address":"12460 Harris Road","city":"Pitt

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>$60 for fencers pre-registered on askFRED by 11\/6.

This is a two-weapon tournament, in which fencers fight in the round, using any epee-bladed weapon and any reasonable off-hand weapon.\r\n\r\nPlease see the links below for rules and pre-registration! The rules for this tournament are rather different from other tournaments in which you may have fenced, so please be sure to read them thoroughly. Also, pre-registration allows us more time to fence, so please sign up ahead of time if at all possible!\r\n\r\nTo anticipate some of the more common questions:\r\n\r\nEach day is a separate competition, so you may fence on Saturday, Sunday, or both.\r\n\r\nThe registration fee is $15 per day, and includes two complimentary tickets to the Festival.\r\n\r\nThis is a dry tournament - no electric equipment needed!\r\n\r\nSome examples of off-hand weapons that have been used in the past include: Dagger, cloak, buckler, hat, and (non-breakable!) mug. You are not limited to these, however! If you have an idea for a second weapon you want to use, present it to the tournament director for approval on the day of the tournament.\r\n\r\nPointes-d'arret are acceptable, but not required.\r\n\r\nAfter the tournament is over, we have the space for open fencing, so stick around! This is a great opportunity to fence people you might not ordinarily come in contact with, and play with different styles and varieties of swordplay.\r\n\r\n\r\nRules: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/document\/d\/1s9WSMnWt-Hh9H91wltNP39fWg6YlOmeDU-Y14OpG4uQ\/edit?fbclid=IwAR35IvihRB0JZwCbxHeO0Wx9TDkvJ3uClAt1ELNf1UULsTjfSgsbDx6mYTQ\r\n\r\nRegistration form: https:\/\/docs.google.com\/forms\/d\/e\/1FAIpQLSdx7gs3hxvQocbKjDwD-1WVzKnHrd3SEmZoyDnZbUexXyOkjA\/viewform?fbclid=IwAR1r0LHZUq4U3CAGtYmoebob3bkpONXER7DYB9tuwB1BMgjN6bQU92ZclBA","venue":{"name":"Bay Area Renaissance Festival","address":"11315 N 46th St, Tampa, Florida 33617","city":"Tampa","state":"FL","zip":"33617","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":28.051485,"longitude":-82.408605,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":55,"name":"Central Florida","abbrev":"CTRFL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":181028,"tournament_id":45777,"tournament":"12th Imperial Fencing Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dagger and Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":13,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"Dagger and","close_of_reg":"2020-02-15T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":181029,"tournament_id":45777,"tournament":"12th Imperial Fencing Tournament","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Dagger and Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":5,"is_team":false,"description":"Dagger and","close_of_reg":"2020-02-16T11:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":46093,"name":"Candlewood Youth, Unrated, and E & Under","start_date":"2020-02-16","end_date":"","comments":"PRE-REGISTRATION EXTENDED TO 2\/14 AT MIDNIGHT!!!

The objective is to provide youth (Y8, Y10, Y12 and Y14) fencers with a measured competitive fencing experience in a series of USFA-sanctioned tournaments with participants from a variety of fencing clubs and of various skill levels.\r\n\r\nFencers will fence in Y8, Y10, Y12 and\/or Y14 age groups of mixed or gender-separate event arrangements. Each participant will earn a certain number of Escrimeur Youth Cup Points at each event throughout the series.\r\n\r\nCALCULATIONS\r\nThe maximum number of points (MxPnts) awarded per event will be based on the age group bracket and the size of event with 10 or more fencers: \r\n\r\nAge Group     MxPnts\r\n  Y8\t       50\r\n  Y10\t       50\r\n  Y12\t      100\r\n  Y14\t      200\r\n\r\nPoints are prorated for events with fewer than 10 fencers by a factor of EvntXRatio:\r\n\r\nEvntXRatio = NEntrs \/ 10\r\n\r\nPoints earned at each event will be calculated as follows:\r\n\r\n((NEntrs - Pl + 1) \/ NEntrs) x MxPnts x EvntXRatio\r\n\r\nThus, 1st place earns the maximum number of Points, while all consecutive places will earn the corresponding number of Points calculated using the formula above. Results with decimal points will be rounded up.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\nY10 event with 10 fencers:\r\n  1 =  50 x 10\/10 = 50\r\n  2 =  45\r\n  3 =  40\r\n     ...\r\n10 =   5\r\n\r\nY12 event with 8 fencers:\r\n  1 = 100 x 8\/10 = 80\r\n  2 =   71\r\n  3 =   60\r\n     ...\r\n  8 =   11\r\n\r\nTotal number of earned Points for Escrimeur Youth Cup Series will be a sum of all Points earned in each competition, bracketed by specific age group and weapon for those fencers who competed in multiple events within a tournament.\r\n\r\nFEES\r\n\r\n- $45 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net by midnight on Sunday the week prior to the tournament;\r\n- $55 per event if registered AND paid through AskFred.net starting Monday through midnight on Saturday the week of the tournament;\r\n- $70 per event for walk-ins and fencers with unpaid online pre-registrations.\r\n\r\nWe accept cash, checks and major credit cards for payments made at the door. 3% processing fee will apply to all credit card transactions.\r\n\r\nREFUND POLICY\r\n\r\nAll payments are non-refundable.
