The arena has plenty of bleacher seating available, along with full restroom\/changing\/shower rooms.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that some of the events are overlapping, it may be difficult or impossible for a fencer to compete in two events at 12pm or 9am. This was unavoidable, given the fact that we have 5 events, and only one day. We discourage fencers from competing in two events at 9am or 12pm. If you choose to compete in two events during these time slots, it is entirely your responsibility to insure that you report to the strip, ready to fence, in each competition, when you are called (even of you are fencing in a bout for the other competition.) Keep in mind the USFA's rulers regarding reporting to the strip when called, and the possibility of being removed from that competition if you fail to so so. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\nFee for each competition is $25.","venue":{"name":"Darlington School","address":"1014 Cave Spring Rd SW","city":"Rome","state":"GA","zip":"30161","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":34.2263652,"longitude":-85.1821928,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":57,"name":"Georgia","abbrev":"GA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87375,"tournament_id":21334,"tournament":"Darlington Tiger Open ","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":10,"prereg_count":11,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-16T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":87377,"tournament_id":21334,"tournament":"Darlington Tiger Open ","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C1","entries":22,"prereg_count":20,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-16T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":88751,"tournament_id":21334,"tournament":"Darlington Tiger Open ","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Y14MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-16T15:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":88752,"tournament_id":21334,"tournament":"Darlington Tiger Open ","full_name":"Div2 Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv2MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":14,"prereg_count":13,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-16T09:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":89045,"tournament_id":21334,"tournament":"Darlington Tiger Open ","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":3,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-16T12:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21598,"name":"South Denver Fencing Academy In-House Tournament","start_date":"2013-03-16","end_date":"","comments":"Tournament is open to all current SDFA class members.

Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus. 7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 42 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ. Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA. Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can't show up, which is why we allow you to miss once. Really, though, its not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Just that you can no longer pre-register. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia, Inc.","address":"3519 Lancaster Avenue","city":"Philadelphia","state":"PA","zip":"19104","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":39.9584448,"longitude":-75.1931571,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":87617,"tournament_id":21413,"tournament":"FAP Open Foil","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"B1","rating_prediction":"A1","entries":18,"prereg_count":24,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-03-17T10:00:00-04:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21165,"name":"Fencers Club Senior Men's & Women's Sabre Open","start_date":"2013-03-17","end_date":"","comments":"Open Men's and Women's Sabre events. $40 if pre-registered through AskFRED, $50 at the door.

The theme is Tropical Jungle Animal. We hope all members of MTFC and their families join us for the potluck. Those who are 18 years old or younger and want to participate in the super-fun team foil event should sign up here. Even if you have never participated in a tournament this is a great way to get started. You should sign up individually and team captains will form equal strength teams before the event. Maximum of 24 fencers who can be part of the tournament so sign up early! \r\n\r\nAll active members of Metro Tacoma Fencing Club (MTFC) are invited to the fencing event and potluck! If you do not want to compete please still come to the potluck! Everyone is encouraged to dress up in tropical wear or as a tropical jungle aninal. Sign-up sheets for the potluck and for volunteers will be available at the club.\r\n\r\nGENERAL REQUIREMENTS\r\n\r\nYou must be an active member of Metro Tacoma Fencing Club (MTFC) and progressed beyond the introduction stage with Coach Andy for a youth fencer to participate in the tournament (more than 1 month fencing). A responsible adult is expected to stay as long as a child is still participating in the tournament and is encouraged to help getting the child on and off the strip (we are happy to show you). US Fencing Association (USFA) competitive membership is not required as these are not sanctioned events. You will still need at least a non-competitive membership to the USFA. This event is not rated and you cannot get a classification change from this event.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE\r\n\r\nThe basic entry fee is $5 per fencer for the fencing tournament. Electric equipment rental is $10 per event. There is no charge for the social potluck and the sign-up sheet for food will be at the club. The equipment rental is separate from the membership dues which cover general open fencing.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIf you do not have electric equipment you are welcome to rent gear for $10 for the event, but plan to\r\narrive 15 minutes before closing of registration to get fitted. If we are short on electric equipment you\r\nwill need to share with other fencers who also rent electric equipment. A youth fencer must go through\r\nan electric equipment introduction with a responsible adult and one of the coaches prior to competing if you have never fenced electric.\r\n\r\nFENCING TOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\n\r\nAll teams will be formed by captains before the event so they can coordinate a team name and any team costumes. Each team will consist of 3 fencers with a total of 8 teams. There with be a total of two rounds for every participant. A third short round will be conducted to determine the winning team fenced only by the top two teams after the initial two rounds.\r\n\r\nThe teams will compete during the first two rounds in a team relay format as is standard for Olympic team fencing events. Since there are 3 fencers per team there are a total of 9 encounters, each up to 3 minutes (each fencer in each team fences every fencer on the other team). Each encounter ends when one of the two teams reaches the next multiple of 5 points or if time runs out. The team that scores 45 points or is ahead when time expires wins.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each round teams that fence each other will be selected randomly. The two teams that have the most victories followed by the best indicators (touches scored by the fencers minus the touches received) will fence each other in an exciting and abbreviated finals round. Because we will all be very tired and up past our bedtimes, the finals will be conducted as a one-touch style relay format going only up to 9 points. \r\n\r\nEVENTS SCHEDULED\r\n\r\nU18 & Below Mixed Foil -- close of registration 6:30 PM\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 02\/11\/2013.\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/21\/2013.\r\n\r\nIf the event fills to the maximum of 24 fencers we will have a waiting list at the club in case anyone cannot attend at the last minute.\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Metro Tacoma Fencing Club","address":"1106 South 15th Street","city":"Tacoma","state":"WA","zip":"98405","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Los_Angeles","latitude":47.2478591,"longitude":-122.4508754,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":1,"name":"Western Washington","abbrev":"WWD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":89868,"tournament_id":21549,"tournament":"MTFC In-House 18 and Under Team Foil and Potluck","full_name":"U19Below Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"U19-MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"U19Below","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":8,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21823,"name":"Win a Blade!!!
