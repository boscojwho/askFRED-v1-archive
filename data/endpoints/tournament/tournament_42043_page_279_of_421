Membership\r\nexceptions for foreign fencers do apply. Athletes without proof of membership must complete\r\ncompetitive membership registration prior to competing.\r\nParents\/guardians should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age\r\nneeds verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to\r\ninformation@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nTo avoid bringing this documentation, USA Fencing has an age verification process.\r\nCurrent Verification Process:\r\nAn athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via\r\nemail (information@usfencing.org), mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the\r\ndatabase. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and\r\ntemporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nSeeding:\r\n Seeding shall be based on the following order:\r\n1. Current national rolling point standings regardless of classification.\r\n2. Classification and year\r\n3. Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the\r\nathletes who are seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\nPoints:\r\nSYC Competitions award national ranking points to the top 40% of the field up to 64\r\nfencers regardless of where the cut off occurs, within a pool round of a direct elimination\r\nbracket. The % is rounded up to the nearest whole number. For example, if there are 17\r\nfencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8. Therefore, the top 7 finishers earn points.\r\nOnly one\/the highest SYC result in a given category is counted towards an athlete\u0092s\r\nNational Ranking. SYC points are awarded at a 0.8 scale of the Youth NAC points\r\ntable. (New 2015-2016)\r\nAny participant, regardless of region, may earn NRPS at an SYC.\r\n\r\nQualification:\r\nThe SYC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the\r\nYouth NAC and for Y10\/12 and 14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\nAthletes finishing in the top 40% of their event at an SYC earn National Ranking points\r\nin that category. In Y12 and Y14 this qualifies athletes to compete at the Summer\r\nNational Championships for the season in which they earned national points.

A percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National Championships for Y12 and Y14. Currently, 100% of Y10 fencers on the Regional Points Standings and National Points Standings gain qualification to the Summer National Championships.   There are NO National Points earned at RYC events.  Y10 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC during the current season to be eligible for the Y10 Summer National Championships.  All athletes whose USA Fencing's membership division is in the region in which the RYC is held will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their region will not earn regional points.  Larger fields will award more points for placement. A percentage of athletes will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website under Rankings, Current Rankings, and then Regional. These rankings are regional only and ARE NOT RELATED IN ANY WAY TO THE NATIONAL ROLLING POINT STANDINGS. All athletes residing in the region in which the tournament is held earn regional points based on placement. Larger fields will award more points for placement.   Best 3 results from RYCs within the athlete's region count toward Regional point totals on a seasonal point basis.  At the end of the season, ranking winners of each age group and gender in each of the 6 regions will be recognized by the Youth Development Committee, Tournament Committee and US Fencing. \r\n\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Youth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12 regional points do NOT trickle down to Y10). \r\n\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well.  For more information on youth qualification paths refer to the Athlete's Handbook: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook \r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y10\/Y12 to March NAC: <\/i>Fencers must fence in at least one Regional (RYC) or SYC in the current season, OR be on Y10 or Y12 points list to be eligible to enter the same category and weapon at the NAC\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path to Y14 NAC<\/i>:  Be age eligible\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y10 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y10 NRPS, OR Be on your Y10 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in the Top 65% of your region's Y12 Regional Youth point standings.\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y12 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y12 NRPS, OR Be in Top 8 of Y10 NRPS, OR Be n the Top 65% of your region's Y12 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in Top 30% of your region's Y14 Regional point standings, OR Be in Top 25% of our Division's Y14 Qualifier\r\n\r\n<i>Qualification Path for Y14 to Summer Nationals:: <\/i> Be on Y14 NRPS, OR Be in Top 16 of Y12 NRPS, OR Be n the Top 30% of your region's Y14 Regional Youth point standings, OR Be in Top 25% of your Division's Y14 Qualifier\r\n\r\nClassification Changes - For classifications to be awarded for a youth tournament, the event must meet the criteria of a Group C1 or better.

Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. <\/i>\r\n\r\n<b>FORMAT:<\/b>\r\n\r\nFormat for all events is one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. \r\nPools: All events will use pools of six or seven whenever possible. In events with fewer than 11 entrants, the BC may elect to have two rounds of pools followed by 100% promoted to a DE (direct elimination) tableau. There is no fence-off for third place. One preliminary round of pools is comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes. 100% then advance to DE round. DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. \r\n<i>Y10 DE format: <\/i>10-touch bouts (two periods of 3 minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period). The first period ends either at the expiration of 3 minutes or when the score reaches 5 touches on one side, whichever comes first. During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n<i>Y12 DE format: <\/i>15-touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute rest between each period). During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n<i>Y14 DE format: (<\/i>15 touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute break between). During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\r\nSeeding for RYC pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification. Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. No classification or affiliation changes will be made at the event. Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\n\r\nThere is no fence-off for third place.\r\nMedals awarded to Top 8. \r\n\r\nFencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc. Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made. Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\nPhotography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\n<b>WITHDRAWAL DURING TOURNAMENT:<\/b>\r\nWithdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<b>SPECTATORS:<\/b>\r\nEverybody taking part in or present at a fencing competition must remain orderly and must not disturb the smooth running of the competition.     At no time is anyone allowed to criticize the Officials or their decisions, to insult them or to attempt to influence them in any way.   Coaches and spectators are allowed to give advice to fencers, but in all situations, coaches and spectators must not disturb the order of the bout.   The referee and\/or the Bout Committee can decide to expel from the competition venue, with or without warning, any person who by gesture, attitude or language disturbs the good order or smooth running of the tournament.  \r\n\r\n<b>===================NEARBY HOTELS<\/b>\r\n\r\nHilton Hasbrouck Heights Meadowlands\r\n650 Terrace Avenue\r\nHasbrouck Heights, NJ  07604\r\n201-288-6100\r\nGroup Rate: $119 Two Double Beds + tax\r\nShuttle Available\r\n\r\nHoliday Inn Hasbrouck Heights-Meadowlands\r\n283 Route 17 South\r\nHasbrouck Heights, NJ  07604\r\n201-288-9600\r\n\r\n\r\nSaddle Brook Marriott\r\n138 New Pehle Avenue\r\nSaddle Brook, NJ  07663\r\n201-843-9500\r\nhttp:\/\/www.marriott.com\/hotels\/travel\/ewrsb-saddle-brook-marriott\r\n\r\nHoliday Inn Express Meadowlands\r\n100 Paterson Plank Road\r\nCarlstadt, NJ  07072\r\nhttp:\/\/www.ihg.com\/holidayinnexpress\/hotels\/us\/en\/carlstadt\/cstnj\/hoteldetail\r\n\r\n<b>================================ABOUT DURKAN FENCING ACADEMY =================================<\/b>\r\nhttp:\/\/www.durkanfencing.com\r\n\r\nOur fencing gym features custom 9-layer Fencing Floor; 18 FIE Grounded Strips; 5 Olympic Strips; Full HVAC (heating\/cooling).

Awards given to the best performing team and the top four performing individuals (regardless of team).

Pools will be fenced as usual and all fencers will be seeded into a direct elimination tableau. Direct elimination bouts will be fenced as per usual open standards. After the first round of D.E.s is complete all of the winners will be reseeded by their initial pool results into a new set of pools. Similarly, the losers of the first set of D.Es will be seeded into their own set of pools.\r\n\r\nPools will be fenced a second time this time divided into two groups determined by results of the first set of D.E.s. After the second round of pools is complete each group of fencers will be seeded into new direct elimination tableau and proceed to fence off all D.E.s until all final placements are set. Awards will be given to the top four participants (first through third) from each of the two tableaus.\r\n\r\nThis event will be sanctioned by US Fencing and ratings will be earned by the individuals who won the first round of D.E.s based on the total initial number of participants and the ratings and placement of the top eight finishers. Participants who lost in the first round of D.E.s will be awarded ratings based on the number of participants starting in their second round of pools and the placement and ratings of fencers in the top eight placement of this event.\r\n<br><\/br>\r\n\r\nHere is the format (See here for a visual example):http:\/\/bit.ly\/2dsjeKZ\r\n\r\nIn our example assume no fencer \"Upsets\" in D.E.s. The higher seeded fencer always advances (of course this is variable in the actual fencing of the D.E.).\r\n\r\nPhase 1:\r\n\r\nAll entering fencers are seeded into pools which follow the normal rules. In our example assume Fencers 1 and 2 are rated as B, 3 and 4 are rated C, and 5 and 6 are rated D. Everyone else, 7-24 are unrated. Assuming both Bs and both Cs finish in the top eight this will be a B1 Event with 24 athletes.\r\n\r\nPools are fenced and a DE Table is seeded from the results.\r\n\r\nPhase 2:\r\nFencers fence their first round D.E.s according to the table determined in Phase 1. Those with a high enough seed receive a Bye as usual (In our example this is 1-8, and the first round is a \"Round of 32\").\r\n\r\nPhase 3:\r\nThis is where the event gets unusual:\r\n\r\nAfter Phase 2 is complete all fencers are reseeded in to new pools determined by their previous D.E. results (See Phase 3 in the attachment). Those fencers that would advance to the next round of the Phase 2 D.E. Table (1-16) fence in one set of pools. These pools will not effect the Phase 2 D.E. Table and are being fenced purely for the fun of more fencing against a wider breadth of the top fencers in the top portion of the event. The results of these pools will not effect the D.E. table already determined by the results of the previous phase, e.g. Fencer 1 will fence Fencer 16 regardless of their Phase 3 Pool results.\r\n\r\nThose fencers eliminated from the Phase 2 D.E.table will similarly be seeded into their own pools. These pools represent the start of a new event where the pool results matter. This event would be between Fencers 17-24 and would be an E1.\r\n\r\nPhase 4:\r\nFencers from the advancing pools resume their D.E.s from Phase 2 and fence out to completion. This event has been fenced through a standard event format with an inter-missionary pool in Phase 3. Upon completion of this part of the event fencers finishing first will be awarded a B16, fencers finishing 2nd-4th will receive C16, 5th-8th a D16, and 9-12 receive an E16.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, those fencers eliminated in the first round of D.E.s (in Phase two), use their Phase 3 Pool results to determine a new D.E. Table then fence out a new event. This event has 8 fencers all of whom are Unrated, making this an E1 event. As such the fencer who wins this portion of the tournament (Fencer 17 in our example) would be awarded an E16.\r\n\r\nStart time: Doors open 7:30, Close of Registration 8:30, Commence fencing 9:00, Event end ~5:00.\r\n\r\n<div><\/div>\r\n\r\nYoung Squire Youth Team Tournament:\r\nAll entrants will be randomly seeded into balanced teams of three to four participants forming four teams. Each team will fence each other team in serial until all possible team matches have occurred.\r\n\r\nEncounters between teams will be fenced in NCAA Team Tournament format. Each fencer on a given team will systematically fence each member of the opposing team in a regulation five touch Pool Style bout. Team victory will go to the team who wins five of the nine encounters. All nine encounters will be fenced, even in the case that a team wins five bouts before the resolution of all nine bouts.\r\n\r\nTeam placement will be determined in order of Team victories, Individual victories within a match, Team Indicator, Team touches scored, team touches received. Awards will be given to all member of the winning team.\r\n\r\nAfter the team event is resolved the top four best performing individuals from any team (even if drawn from the same team) will be seeded according to their team event performance and will fence off for 1st through 4rd place in standard 15pt D.E.\r\n\r\nThis event is non- US Fencing Sanctioned, but will follow all regulations mandated by US Fencing.\r\n\r\nEach team will be assigned a Volunteer Support who will help the children get on and off the strip, help with equipment issues, and facilitate the flow of the event as directed by the Referees and Bout Committee. This event is capped at 16 participants with preferential entry given first to DMFC participants.\r\n\r\nStart time: Doors open 7:30, Close of Registration 8:30, Commence fencing 9:00 event end ~2:30.\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficials:\r\n\r\nDMFC will need at least seven Foil Referees and three Bout Committee members to successfully present this tournament. We will be attempting to fill these requirements internally to the extent possible. If we are unable to fill our staffing requirements we may need to self-direct bouts from the competitors, or cancel as determined by the DMFC Staff, and Board of Directors.\r\n\r\nHowever if you are able to provide services as an official please contact Coach Alex Harms at alexmharms@gmail.com.\r\n\r\nOfficials will be compensated as below:\r\nBout committee members and referees will be compensated at $50.00 for the day + one even share of 20% of Net income generated by the tournament. Bout Committee members, Referees, and official Youth Support Volunteers will be provided with a lunch (Estimated cost $10.00 per person).","venue":{"name":"Indian Hills Junior High School","address":"9401 Indian Hills Drive","city":"Clive","state":"IA","zip":"50325-6321","country":"USA","timezone":null,"latitude":41.6033716,"longitude":-93.7479639,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":34,"name":"Iowa","abbrev":"IA","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":137370,"tournament_id":34721,"tournament":"Champion Forge Foil Tournament (DMFC 2016)","full_name":"Youth Mixed Non-USFA, NCAA Team Format Foil","short_name":"YMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Youth","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":10,"is_team":false,"description":"Non-USFA, NCAA Team Format","close_of_reg":"2016-10-15T08:45:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":137371,"tournament_id":34721,"tournament":"Champion Forge Foil Tournament (DMFC 2016)","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":7,"prereg_count":7,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2016-10-15T08:45:00-07:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":139871,"tournament_id":34721,"tournament":"Champion Forge Foil Tournament (DMFC 2016)","full_name":"Senior Mixed   - Auxillary Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":3,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"  - Auxillary","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":34977,"name":"6th Annual Peter Folgner Memorial Sabre Tournament","start_date":"2016-10-15","end_date":"","comments":"Senior Mixed Sabre, sanctioned.\r\n$30 entry fee.\r\n\r\nMust be a current USFA member when pre-registering on AskFred.\r\nA minimum of 6 fencers needed to hold event.\r\nThe new sabre enguarde line rule will be observed.","prereg_open":"2016-09-15","prereg_close":"2016-10-14","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"Senior Mixed Sabre (ages 13+, sanctioned.\r\n \r\nEvent must have a minimum of 6 fencers to be held.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. Our space is now limited and we are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that we are required to limit how many people can participate. We also are required to hire referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via askFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n**$35 for fencers registering on askFRED by 10\/12\/16.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nQ. Why are you instituting this policy?\r\nA. We are committed to running smooth, efficient tournaments, which means that sometimes we need to limit how many people can participate. Some events also require hired referees and they have to be paid whether or not the registered number of fencers show up. Also, if you pre-register and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn't fair. We do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nQ. What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I've done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA. Well, just that. You can no longer pre-register via AskFRED. That's the only penalty. You are still welcome to fence the events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won't be able to fence. If an event is not full, you can email the organizer, who may be able to add you at their discretion. NO guarantees though!\r\n\r\nFOIL: Y-10 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-12 - 1:00  PM check-in (closes)\r\nFOIL: Y-14 - 10:00 AM check-in (closes)\r\n\r\nYou many only compete in two events in one day IF the check-in times are staggered.\r\n\r\nCurrent valid USA Fencing membership is required.

You may join\/renew at the door, however please arrive with a completed membership form (parent signature required for fencers under age 18). USA Fencing membership forms can be downloaded at usfencing.org or plan to come early to complete required paperwork. Please have separate checks made out to USA Fencing or use your credit card for your USA Fencing membership payment.  Bear in mind, USA Fencing now charges a $10 fee to renew your membership by mail\/paper.  Membership can be renewed online, as well. If you renew online, please print out your new card or payment receipt to show at the registration desk.\r\n\r\nAll fencers are expected to wear the required fencing attire and bring at least two weapons and body cords that meet USA Fencing requirements. There are no exceptions to the attire and equipment rules. <b>Y-10 fencers NEED (2) #2 blades to fence in a Y-10 event.<\/b>\r\n\r\nPLEASE NOTE: As of Aug 1, 2012, all foil fencers will need to wear the new lame bib and come with (2) mask cords.

A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n<I>SPECTATORS:<\/I>\r\n\r\nEverybody taking part in or present at a fencing competition must remain orderly and must not disturb the smooth running of the competition.     At no time is anyone allowed to criticize the Officials or their decisions, to insult them or to attempt to influence them in any way.   Coaches and spectators are allowed to give advice to fencers, but in all situations, coaches and spectators must not disturb the order of the bout.   The referee and\/or the Bout Committee can decide to expel from the competition venue, with or without warning, any person who by gesture, attitude or language disturbs the good order or smooth running of the tournament.  \r\n\r\n\r\n<b>==============================<\/b>\r\n<b>EQUIPMENT CHECK<\/b>\r\n<b>==============================<\/b>\r\n\r\nArrive early to allow time for equipment check.

The parking lot directly across the street. This lot always fills up first and on Friday afternoon it will have only a few spaces. If you park in this lot make sure you are not blocking anyone else from leaving.\r\n\r\n2.       You can park nose in to the cyclone fence between Grove St. and Marin Blvd on 16th Street. However, DO NOT PARK IN FRONT OF THE SLIDING GATE which is in operation during the weekend and is clearly marked. Any car parking there will be towed. This gate will be marked off with colored cones.\r\n\r\n3.       When the above spaces are full, drop your fencer off at the building so that they can go up and check themselves in. Proceed north on Grove Street to the light at 18th Street\r\n\r\nTurn left and go about 200 yards. On the left across the street from the Tiger Mart you will see a bright yellow post. Turn left into the large lot and find parking to the right in two large parking lots or up against the truck bays. After you park walk back around the block to the building entrance.\r\n\r\n*IMPORTANT NOTE- the small parking lot at the southwest corner of Grove and 18th St is no longer available for Cobra Events. Do not park in this lot even if there are empty spaces.\r\n\r\n<b>NEAREST AIRPORT:<\/b> Newark Liberty International (12 miles away)\r\n\r\n<b>PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION: <\/b>From Manhattan by train: PATH train from Manhattan to Hoboken.

A percentage of point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer National Championships and for the JO Championships in Junior and Cadet. In addition, athletes who accumulate a pre-established point total within the qualifying period for Junior Olympics (110) or the July Challenge (65), will qualify, whether or not they fall into the qualifying percent. Up to the best 2 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional Rank each season. Athletes still can also qualify for the JOs through the National Rolling Point Standings and Division qualifying events. In addition to the RJCCs, athletes also can qualify for the July Challenge through the NRPS.\r\n\r\n There is NO trickle down for points at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional Cadet or Junior tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. There IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. \r\n\r\n For Summer Nationals\/July Challenge, qualification is finalized after the last RJCC event in each region. RJCC points are considered seasonal. Rankings will be managed by the National Office and available for viewing on the USA Fencing Website. The USFA Athlete Handbook contains detailed information on qualifying pathways, and should be consulted as the appropriate reference document. \r\n\r\n Foreign fencers may compete in RJCCs and earn RRPS and may use this path to compete in the July Challenge; however, they are not eligible to compete at the Junior Olympics because it is a National Championship. When calculating the qualifying % from the RRPS for the Junior Olympics, any foreign fencers who fall into the qualifying % will be skipped and the next eligible fencer will earn qualification. Foreign fencers are not eligible to win an overall RRPS patch. A foreign athlete who falls into the top 3 on the RRPS will be skipped and the next eligible athlete will win the patch.\r\n\r\nJunior Qualification Path to JO's: \r\n\u0095 Fencers must meet age eligibility AND \r\n\u0095 Be on the Junior national rolling point standings (NRPS) at the regular fee entry deadline, OR \r\n\u0095 Be in the top 16 of the Cadet national rolling point standings (NRPS) at the regular fee entry deadline, OR \r\n\u0095 Top 25% on your region\u0092s Junior RJCC Regional Point Standings, OR \r\n\u0095 Earn at least 110 regional points on the Junior Regional Point Standing, OR \r\n\u0095 Be in the top 25% (round up) of their division\u0092s Junior JO qualifying competition \r\n\r\nCadet Qualification Path to JO's:\r\n\u0095 Fencers must meet eligibility AND \r\n\u0095 Be on the Cadet National Rolling Point Standings (NRPS) at the regular fee entry deadline, OR \r\n\u0095 Be in the top 25% of their region\u0092s Cadet Regional Circuit Point Standings at the regular fee entry deadline, OR\r\n\u0095 Be in the top 25% of their region\u0092s Junior Regional Circuit point standings at the regular fee entry deadline, OR \r\n\u0095 Earn at least 110 regional points on either the Cadet or Junior Regional Point Standing, OR \r\n\u0095 Be in the top 8 of the Youth 14 national rolling point standings (NRPS) at the regular fee entry deadline, OR \r\n\u0095 Be in the top 25% (round up) of their division\u0092s Cadet JO qualifying competition, OR \r\n\u0095 Be in the top 25% (round up) of their division\u0092s Junior JO qualifying competition.

(For example: Junior regional points do NOT trickle down to Cadet).\r\n-\tThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer qualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn qualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the July Challenge in Juniors and is age eligible for Cadet, he\/she will also qualify in Cadet)\r\n-\tThere are NO National Points earned at RJCC events.

Join us for two days of team competition! Open and D & Under foil and epee events.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: 2016 Ray Coates Memorial Team Tourney\r\nDate(s): 10\/22\/2016 - 10\/23\/2016\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nSaturday, October 22nd:\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Open Team Foil, D & Under Team Epee\r\n\r\nSunday, October 23rd:\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Open Team Epee, D & Under Team Foil\r\n\r\nAll times listed are close of registration.\r\n\r\nDepending on the number of teams in each event, the event format will either be round robin, or direct elimination with all places fenced out. Each team match will be relay format to 45 touches.\r\n\r\nAll events are for fencers born in 2003 or earlier. Open events are for all classifications. D & Under events are for fencers classified \"D\" or under in the weapon they're fencing.\r\n\r\nAll teams may be men, women, or mixed, and may consist of 3 team members plus an optional alternate.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team to fence on, show up anyway. We'll set you up with one.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must be current (2016-2017) competitive members of the USFA or CFF. All fencers must have full regulation uniform, including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. RCFC has these items available for purchase if necessary.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for purchase.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nThe entry fee is $60 per team. There will be medals and prizes for the top 3 teams in each event.\r\n\r\n------------------ To Preregister: ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=34839\r\nPreregistration closes on 10\/21\/2016\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Membership\r\nexceptions for foreign fencers do apply. Athletes without proof of membership must complete\r\ncompetitive membership registration prior to competing.\r\nParents\/guardians should come prepared with ONE of the following in case the fencer\u0092s age\r\nneeds verification for eligibility purposes or submit one of the following to\r\ninformation@usfencing.org:\r\n1. A government issued photo ID with date of birth included\r\n2. A copy of birth certificate\r\n3. Passport\r\nTo avoid bringing this documentation, USA Fencing has an age verification process.\r\nCurrent Verification Process:\r\nAn athlete can submit a copy of their birth certificate or passport to the National Office via\r\nemail (information@usfencing.org), mail or fax and they will verify the DOB in the\r\ndatabase. Once the date of birth has been verified, it is indicated on permanent and\r\ntemporary membership cards.\r\n\r\nSEEDING:\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nSeeding should be based on the following order:\r\n\u0095 Current National Rolling Points Standing regardless of classification\r\n\u0095 Classification and year\r\n\u0095 Athletes with neither of the above are seeded on a random basis after the athletes who\r\nare seeded by the preceding factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS:\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nAll athletes whose USA Fencing\u0092s membership division is in the region in which the RYC is\r\nheld will earn regional points based on placement. Athletes fencing in an RYC outside their\r\nregion will not earn regional points. Larger fields will award more points for placement. A\r\npercentage of athletes (Y12\/Y14) will earn qualification from their rankings on the RRPS. For\r\nmore information on this Regional Points formula see the Regional Recognition Initiative\r\nDocument available on http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rycresources.\r\nUp to the best 3 results in a given category will be combined to determine a fencer\u0092s Regional\r\nRank each season.\r\nThere is NO trickle down for POINTS at the Regional level. Points earned in a Regional\r\nYouth tournament only appear in the category in which they were earned. (For example: Y12\r\nregional points do NOT trickle down to Y10).\r\nThere IS trickle down for QUALIFICATION at the Regional level. Therefore, if a fencer\r\nqualifies in an older age group and is age eligible for a younger age group, they earn\r\nqualification in that category as well. (For example: If a fencer qualifies to the National\r\nChampionships in Y14 and is age eligible for Y12, he\/she will also qualify in Y12)\r\nThere are NO National Points earned at RYC events.\r\n(Youth National points (NRPS) are awarded to the top 40% of the competitive field at an SYC\r\nto a maximum of 64 fencers and, depending on the size of the competitive field, to the top 32\r\nor 64 fencers (depending on field size) at Youth NACs and Summer National Championships.) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUALIFICATIONS:\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nThe RYC tournament serves as one qualifying path for Y10 and Y12 fencers to the Youth\r\nNAC and for Y10\/12 and 14 fencers to the Summer National Championships.\r\nA percentage of regional point holders from each region will earn qualification to the Summer\r\nNational Championships in Y12 and Y14. For more information on Youth\r\nQualification paths refer to the Athlete\u0092s Handbook: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/athletehandbook\r\nand the qualification table available under the \u0093Qualification\u0094 tab on the RJCC resources page:\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/rjccresources.\r\nOrganizers are responsible for being able to answer questions from the membership\r\nconcerning Regional Points and Qualification at their tournament.\r\nYouth NAC: Y10 and Y12 fencers must participate in at least one RYC or SYC tournament\r\nprior to the regular registration deadline for the March\/April Youth NAC in order to be\r\nconsidered eligible to compete. RYCs that take place before the Youth NAC but after the\r\nregular registration deadline will NOT be considered for meeting eligibility requirement for the\r\nYouth NAC. Y14 registration for this NAC is open and has no pre-tournament requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATIONS:\r\nClassifications may be awarded only at tournaments at which electrical apparatus for the\r\nscoring of touches is used. Please refer to the Classification Chart for more information.\r\nhttp:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698401-classification-chart\r\n\r\nRYC:\r\nThe competition must meet or exceed criteria in Group C1 or higher to award changes in\r\nclassification.
