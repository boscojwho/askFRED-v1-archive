Any event which has three or fewer entries will not be fenced; all entries in those events will be submitted to USFA as qualified for that event.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT CHANGE THIS YEAR: Qualifying for the Junior or Cadet events at Nationals no longer qualifies fencers for either Div. 2 or Div. 3. If you want to compete in either Div. 2 or Div. 3, you must fence in this qualifier.\r\n\r\nDiv. II, Div III, and Veteran will be fenced in a single event for each weapon. Veterans may only fence in this qualifier if their ratings qualify them to do so. (Otherwise, veterans may qualify by fencing in the section championships or in any NAC this season.)\r\n\r\nDiv. I and Senior Teams are a single event at Nationals this year; seeding will be based on the Senior NRPS instead of the individual event results at Nationals.\r\n\r\nFor specific details of qualification paths and eligibility for Summer Nationals, please refer to the USFA's 2006\u00962007 Athlete Handbook, downloadable from the USFA website. Please note that some changes were made at the fall USFA board meeting, however.\r\n\r\nDeadline for close of preregistration is midnight, Wednesday, February 28, 2006. No entries will be accepted after that date.\r\n\r\nEntry fees will be collected at the venue for those events which are actually fenced.

Late entry fee $30 for registrations on 3\/5\/2007 or later.\r\n\r\nFAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). A USFA card (or money to join - $50 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in convertion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers (total for combined event). If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\nPre-registered fencers - if you are unable to attend, PLEASE delete your registration so that others can sign up.

The tournament will consist of open events for Foil, Sabre and Epee, and a Junior (U-20) Sabre event.\r\n\r\nEVENTS\r\nJUNIOR (U-20) SABRE\r\nRegistration 8:00 to 8:30 AM FENCING BEGINS at 8:45\r\nFOR THIS EVENT ONLY:\r\nthe cost is $15\/participant and only a recreational passport is required.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOPEN EVENTS\r\n\r\nMF: Mixed Foil\r\nRegistration 8:30 to 9:30 FENCING BEGINS soon after 10:00\r\n\r\nME: Men's Epee\r\nRegistration 10:00 to 10:30 FENCING BEGINS AT 11:00\r\n\r\nWE: Women's Epee\r\nRegistration 10:00 to 10:30 FENCING BEGINS AT 11:00\r\n\r\nMS: Mixed Sabre\r\nRegistration 10:30 to 12:30 FENCING BEGINS AT 13:00\r\n\r\nPools will be self-directed\r\n\r\nTHIS EVENT WILL BE HELD UNDER THE SANCTION OF THE BRITISH COLUMBIA BRANCH OF THE CANADIAN FENCING FEDERATION AND SUBJECT TO ALL APPLICABLE CFF AND FIE RULES. We are currently waiting for confirmation of the status of this tournament under the BCFA.\r\n\r\nEquipment\r\nAll entrants must have proper protective equipment for events, masks must pass a punch test (FIE label not required) and be stamped prior to the event. Fencing lames will be tested. All fencers must wear plastrons (under arm protectors) if they are not using an FIE fencing jacket.

Payment will be collected at the registration on the day of the tournament. Please do not mail cheques or cash.\r\n\r\nPre-registration closes on Friday March 16th 2007.\r\nPlease note that late registrations (registration on the day of the tournament) will be subject to a $10 late charge per event.\r\n\r\nFOR OUR AMERICAN PARTICIPANTS: Please be advised we cannot accept your cheques if they are made in American funds. We will, however, accept cash in US funds at par at the registration table. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS:\r\n\r\nHere's a map of UBC: http:\/\/www.ubc.ca\/about\/ubcmap.pdf\r\n\r\nSUB - Student Union Building is at C\/D-4\/5 [latitudes & longitudes] in the map.\r\n\r\nThere's a parkade north of it, or you can park in the open air parkade between Gate 1 & Gate 2 [at C\/D 5].\r\n\r\nDid you come to the PBI? The Peter Bakonyi International?\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building between the two gyms we used on the left if you were going form the War Memorial Gym to the other gym.\r\n\r\nIf you come from the ferry, or the border after Oak St Bridge,\r\n\r\nOption A: take either the WEST-BOUND EXIT Marine Drive or\r\n\r\nOption B: follow Oak St all the way to 41st, then turn left to 41st\r\n\r\n41st becomes marine Drive.\r\n\r\nMarine Drive to 16th Ave (at the bottom of the UBC map) that's the first and only exit on the right clost to the end of the freeway section of Marine Drive.\r\n\r\nOn 16th at the 2nd traffic light, turn left, to Wesbrook; past 2 traffic lights - don't run the red lights, ok?\r\n\r\nTurn left at GATE 11 - There will be a parking lot directly on your right, but it's a bit far away from the SUB. IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old busloop (labeled bus loop construction on the map) there is parking there right in front of the SUB.\r\nI think the rate is $3.50 for the whole day.\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediate,y north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you're in, pass the tall highrises of Gage Towers.\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C\/D 4\/5 on the map.\r\nSorry, I don't know the all-day rate there.\r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunkerlike building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE..\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north. there will be signs)\r\n\r\nIt's fairly easy to find.
