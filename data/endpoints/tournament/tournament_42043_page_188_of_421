He was born in Grand Forks, ND on August 2, 1930. Selberg received his Maitre D'Armes from the Federation International D'Escrime in 1967. In addition to being a fencing master, Selberg was also an abstract, post-impressionist painter. He has a painting in the permanent collection at Minnesota State University Moorhead in Moorhead, MN, and also one at North Dakota State University in Fargo, ND. On the side of the McCormick building in downtown Fargo, ND is a restored version of his infamous sign painting of 'The Cowboy' that he painted originally in 1949 (commissioned by Sunny Brook Whiskey). Charles had a particular fondness for gorillas. Sign painter, cartoonist and artist, Selberg moved to California in 1952 where he received Bachelor of Fine Arts and Master of Fine of Arts degrees from San Francisco State University. Selberg taught art in San Francisco and fell in love with fencing in the early 1950's. Fencing first took root in North Dakota in 1960, when Maestro Selberg moved from San Francisco, where he was the head coach at the San Francisco School of Fencing (run by John McDougall), back to Fargo, ND, where he then founded North Dakota's first fencing school, the Selberg Fencing Academy, which he operated there between 1960 and 1966. The Selberg Fencing Academy (SFA) was located originally at 54 1\/2 North 5th St. in Fargo, but was moved in 1965 to the Fargo Arena building in Island Park in Fargo. Selberg thought that fencing would do well in Fargo because of the long cold winters that forced people indoors for physical activity. Fencing competitions in Fargo during that time (including many dual matches between Minneapolis and Fargo) were held either at the SFA or at Moorhead State University, in their large gym. Between 1960 and 1966, the North Dakota division grew to become the 4th-largest fencing division in the country, and SFA fencers won three Midwest Championships, a Chicagoland Open Championship, and finished in the Top 10 at the U.S. National Championships in Women's Foil two years in a row. In 1966, Selberg returned to San Francisco where he then taught at the Halberstadt Fencer's club, and began his 16-year career teaching fencing at the University of California at Santa Cruz (where he was a tenured member of the eminent faculty of Cowell College). Known affectionately as Mr. Natural amongst fencers at the University of California at Santa Cruz, due to his engaging approach to teaching fencing, Maestro Selberg was revered for his keen psychological and strategic insights into the game. His ability to teach quality fencing to large groups of students was a tribute to his deep knowledge of the sport, his creative ability, and his tremendous sense of humor. The fencing masters that taught Charles formed his most impressive fencing lineage: German born Eric Funke, followed by American born Jack Nottingham (taught by Aldo Nadi), and Hungarian-born Olympic champion George Pillar (taught by Laszlo Borsody and Italo Santelli). His years working with Hans Halberstadt also left a profound impression on Charles\u0092 teaching. In 1970, he was a member of the only U.S. foil team to ever win a gold medal at the World Masters Championships. Named one of the 'Great Fencing Masters in History' by Amarillo College in Texas, Charles was the author of the renowned books 'Foil' (1976) and 'Revised Foil' (1993). After retiring from the University of California at Santa Cruz in 1982, Selberg moved to Ashland, Oregon where he resumed the Selberg Fencing Academy and created an extensive series of instructional fencing videos and DVDs (http:\/\/www.selbergfencing.com). Maestro Selberg taught that the greatest benefits that we get from fencing are health and recreation.\r\n","venue":{"name":"Clara Barton Elementary School","address":"1417 6th Street South, Fargo, ND 58103","city":"Fargo","state":"ND","zip":"58103","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":46.858526,"longitude":-96.789691,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":50,"name":"Nebraska-South Dakota","abbrev":"NE-SD","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":92415,"tournament_id":22903,"tournament":"2013 Charles Selberg Memorial Open ","full_name":"Unsanctioned Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":10,"prereg_count":6,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2013-08-03T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":21665,"name":"Nutmeg State Games Fencing","start_date":"2013-08-03","end_date":"2013-08-05","comments":"The NSG is open to all USFA members.
