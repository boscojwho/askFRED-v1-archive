You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

When you remove your name from the list the day of the event THAT IS A NO SHOW.  You have just wasted the time and money of others who have already traveled to the venue expecting to compete in a sanctioned event.  If an emergency occurs please call or email so we can, if necessary, notify other competitors BEFORE they travel for a tournament they arrive expecting to run.  \r\n\r\nSTARTING WITH THE 2019-2020 SEASON, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. \r\n\r\nIf duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEVENT ORGANIZERS NEED TO HAVE A REASONABLY ACCURATE HEAD COUNT IN ORDER TO HIRE THE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF REFEREES. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We are committed to providing a positive tournament experience so we don't want this to happen.  Please help us to promote a good tournament experience for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n** Liability waiver - Upon entering this tournament you agree to abide by the current rules of the USFA and other applicable rules instituted by Fencing Academy of Philadelphia.

Open to fencers born 2006 or earlier. Medals and classifications will be awarded.\r\n\r\nOn August 6th, 2016, the Bucks County Academy of Fencing suffered the sudden and unexpected loss of one of the longest established members of our coaching staff, Mitch Davis. After starting fencing in high school, Mitch joined the BCAF as a student in the mid 1980's and had been a member of the BCAF coaching staff for over 25 years.  He was a kind and caring man who inspired his students with his infectious enthusiasm. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Mitch was an avid Revolutionary War historian and re-enactor.  His passion for both fencing and history touched many lives in both communities and sparked a life-long interest in many young people.  \r\n \r\nWith this competition, we honor his memory.\r\n\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

If you are listed as pre-registered in the 48 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list. If you do so a second time, you will not be able to pre-register for BCAF events for the remainder of the season. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. If you are not sure how to do that, click on the \"Email the Tournament Organizer\" link and we'll help you out.\r\n\r\nWe do understand that an unavoidable circumstance can happen (sickness, family emergency, etc.) which prevent you from showing up, which is why we allow you to miss ONCE without a penalty. \r\n\r\nIf you do end up on our \"no pre-registration list\", you are still always welcome to fence at our events, but you'll have to take your chances with showing up at the door and paying the walk-in fee. \r\n\r\nStarting with the 2019-2020 season, we are instituting a new policy of weeding out duplicate pre-registrations. One week before an event OR if a waiting list becomes necessary (whichever comes first), the organizers will check other area events to see if any of the fencers on our list are also pre-registered for other events. If duplicate pre-registrations are found, the fencer(s) will receive an e-mail asking them to choose which event they will attend. The organizers will re-check the duplicates in 48 hours. If there are still duplicates, the fencer(s) will be removed from our pre-registration.\r\n\r\nEvent organizers NEED to have a fairly accurate head-count in order to hire the appropriate number of referees. If we over-hire, the club loses a lot of money. If we under-hire, the fencers will have long waits and a bad experience. We don't want either of these to happen.\r\n\r\n<b>BCAF Waiting-list policy:<\/b>\r\n\r\nPre-registration limited to first 48 fencers (32 men and 16 women). If the pre-registration is full, send the organizer an email (debbie@bcaf.com) with your name, club, and member number. You will be put on the waiting list and notified by a confirmation e-mail from askFRED if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with askFRED, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.  Maximum numbers may be adjusted to accommodate as many fencers as possible without double-flighting. \r\n\r\nFEES:\r\n\r\n<b>**$40 for fencers registering on askFRED by 3\/4\/20.

Therefore, The Cory Stauble Memorial Open & Potluck, scheduled for Saturday, March 14th, will be postponed, as COVID-19 has been reported in Kentucky.  We greatly apologize for any inconvenience this has caused.\r\n\r\nWe will communicate regularly through email regarding a reschedule date of the event, after health and state officials provide additional guidance or recommendations.\r\n\r\nThe Cory Stauble Memorial Open is an honored event for the Louisville Fencing Center.

You will be representing your School instead of your club. Tournament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s this season will be used to gauge the interest in High School and Middle School fencers in the North Texas area. Especially those attending schools that don't necessarily have a formal fencing team. Scholastic points will be awarded at each tournament and medals will be awarded at the end of the series to the top 3 fencers in each weapon with the highest point totals of all three tournaments.\r\n \r\nThis tournament is open to <b>High School (9-12 grades) and Middle\/Junior High School (6-8 grades)<\/b> fencers. Fencers must be competitive members of USA Fencing (may be on a school roster). Remember: You are representing your school and not your club. <\/b>Your school does not have to have a fencing team for you to represent your school and earn points.<\/b>\r\n\r\nWe will be adding a Team event at a later tournament. \r\n\r\nRegistration fee = $20\r\nEvent Fee (Per event) = $20\r\n\r\n<b>Eligibility<\/b> \r\nThe tournaments of the North Texas Scholastic Fencing League are \"open\" to fencers who are in the appropriate age group as defined by their year in school. High School fencers are in grades 9 through 12; Middle School fencers are in grades 6 through 8. A fencer in Middle School CANNOT fence in a High School competition until they are in 9th grade. \r\n\r\n<b>Required Equipment<\/b> \r\nPlease wear shoes with \"non-marking\" or white soles to all competitions. \r\n\r\n<b>Uniform<\/b> \r\nAt all USFA tournaments the following equipment is required: a full jacket (FIE not required), a plastron, a glove and fencing knickers. Jeans, corduroys, sweatpants or baseball trousers are not permitted. Socks must cover all the leg not covered by the knickers. Women's equipment must include breast protectors made of metal or rigid material inside the jacket. The appropriate glove, lame and mask for the weapon being fenced are required. Fencers must wear a mask with a sewn-in bib that passes the 12K punch test.<b> Names on the uniform are not required for the North Texas Scholastic Fencing League.<\/b> If the fencer has his\/her name on the jacket or knickers, it should follow the USFA rules: the fencer's last name must be legibly printed on the uniform in dark blue capital letters not more than 10 cm high. The name must be located either (1) on the back of the uniform between the shoulders; (2) on the front or side of the \"rear\" thigh; or (3) on a piece of fabric or lame material that is firmly sewn to the uniform so that it will not catch the opponent's point. Fabric attached to the uniform must be the same color as that part of the uniform. Attached lame material cannot alter the conductivity of the metallic vest or jacket. Names printed on tape are NOT acceptable. The country's colors are not required; if the fencer chooses to use them, FIE rules for country's colors should be followed. \r\n\r\n<b>Inspections<\/b>\r\nMasks will be inspected by the armorer. Weapons will be tested on the strip. You will not be allowed to fence with weapons that do not conform to USFA standards. For weapons that fail inspection on the strip, no card will be issued but you must get another conforming weapon. \r\n\r\n<b>Format<\/b> \r\nThere will be one round of pools with 100% advancing to direct elimination in all individual competitions. The direct elimination bouts for the High School and Middle School competitions will be fifteen touch bouts, with the appropriate breaks determined by which weapon is being fenced. A team consists of 3 fencers and a possible alternate. Team competitions are a round robin if there are four or fewer teams. If there are more than four teams in the competition, the team tableau is used, with each place fenced off. Team competitions use the NCAA team match format of a five-touch bout between each member of both teams, for 9 bouts. All 9 five-touch bouts are fenced. The winning team is the team with five or more bouts won in the match. If a team consists of only 2 fencers, it forfeits 3 bouts. \r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: -------------------\r\nTournament: North Texas Scholastic Fencing League Open #1\r\n\r\nDate(s): <b>03\/14\/2020<\/b>\r\n\r\nLocation: \r\n<b>Fencing Institute of Texas\r\n1000 West Crosby Road, Suite 134\r\nCarrollton, Texas 75006<\/b>\r\n(972) 242-0399\r\n\r\n<b>Fees:<\/b>\r\n$20 Registration  \r\n$20 Per Event\r\n\r\n<b>EVENTS<\/b>\r\nSaturday 3\/14\r\nU19 & Below Women's High School Epee\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6... ...9:00AM\r\nU19 & Below Men's High School Epee\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\u00e2\u0080\u00a6....9:00 AM\r\nU19 & Below Men's High School Foil\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.....10:00 AM\r\nU19 & Below Women's High School Foil\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6...\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.10:00 AM\r\nU16 & Below Women's Middle School Epee\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..10:00 AM\r\nU16 & Below Men's Middle School Epee\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.10:00 AM\r\nU16 & Below Men's Middle School Foil\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.11:00 AM \r\nU16 & Below Women's Middle SchoolFoil\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.11:00 AM\r\nU19 & Below Women's High School Saber\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6.......12:00 PM\r\nU19 & Below Men's High School Saber\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..12:00 PM\r\nU16 & Below Women's Middle School Saber\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6...1:00 PM\r\nU16 & Below Men's Middle School Saber\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6\u00e2\u0080\u00a6..1:00 PM\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=46298\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=46298\r\nPreregistration closes on 03\/12\/2020\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

In this example there are 38 such fencers. 25% of that group\r\nequals 10, the number of fencers who can qualify for Division III Nationals.\r\nStarting with the first fencer after those qualified for Division II (in this example, 13th place); count off the next 10\r\nD, E, or U fencers who have not already qualified by other paths. These 10 D, E, or U fencers are qualified for\r\nDivision III. (Any C fencers in this range are skipped, but not counted against the 10, because they are not eligible\r\nto fence Division III.)\r\n\r\nWe will be selling concession items such as fruit, water, gaterade, and protein bars.

Participants need a Non-Competitive Membership to compete.  Full regulation uniform is not required.  Fencers must wear either knickers and long socks or long pants, Plastron, Jacket, Glove, Mask, and Chest protector for girls.\r\n\r\nThe Junior event is a sanctioned event.  Ratings can be earned per the USA Fencing Chart (https:\/\/askfred.net\/Info\/eventClass.php)  All fencers must be current competitive members of the USFA for the 2019-2020 season. Please bring in proof of membership to speed up check-in. You cannot fence without a USFA membership. Go to http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/membership to join.  Full USFA regulation uniform is required for the junior event, including plastron (underarm protector), knickers, and knee-length socks. No jeans or sweatpants allowed. Chest protectors are required for female fencers, optional for male fencers.  Names are not required on your uniform, but if you have your name on your uniform you will look extra awesome.\r\n\r\nLOCATION\r\nWe are physically located at 8629 S Tacoma Way Lakewood, WA 98499, right next to the Olympus Spa and across the street from H Mart.

Fencing will begin shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nENTRY FEE: $20 per fencer if pre-registered on AskFRED for 1 event, $30 for two events.  $25\/$35 at the door.\r\n\r\nRENTAL GEAR: A limited supply of very old and unreliable electric equipment will be available for rent at the event, but it is all club gear and you take your chances with it. We will charge you $15 to use it for the event which seems really expensive for what you are getting. And if it fails on the strip you will get carded. So perhaps it is time to invest in some of your own gear.  (Rental fee waived for current MTFC Members at in house events)\r\n\r\n------------------ Tournament Rules ------------------- \r\n\r\n\r\nFORMAT: One round of pools followed by direct eliminations. There will be 100% promotion to direct eliminations.  Y10 fencers will fence 10 point DE.
