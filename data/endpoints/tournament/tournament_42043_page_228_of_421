Names are NOT required on your uniform. Fencers must wear the required clothing regulation fencing jacket and pants, underarm protector (plastron), knee socks and a fencing glove that covers half the forearm. The electric foil bib is required. Women must wear breast protectors. In epee and foil, a full jacket is required (i.e., a jacket with croissard \/ groin strap). Warm-up pants are not allowed. Fencing uniforms or gloves must not have any rips, tears, holes, etc. USA Fencing allows uniforms of a single pastel color or designs on the rear (unarmed) arm and leg. As the purpose of uniform color or design is for audience interest, such designs should be in good taste. For safety and insurance purposes, fencers must wear full fencing attire while participating in drills, lessons or warm-up.\r\n \r\nBlade Length: Y8 & Y10 fencers must fence with weapons NO LONGER than 32.5 inches (\u00930 & 2's\u0094). Parents and fencers are advised that blades marked as \"#2\" are believed to meet this requirement, however some blades labeled as #2 have exceeded 32.5 inches, these blades will not be permitted. \r\n \r\nEQUIPMENT CHECK \r\nParents and fencers should plan accordingly and arrive at least 1 hour prior to the close of check in.\r\n \r\nFencers must present to the armorer for testing of mask, lame jacket, gloves (saber) and body cords. Items passing inspection will be specially marked. Masks that do not pass the 12-kg punch test will be impounded or given a visible mark to signify that the mask is \"not approved for use.\"\r\n \r\nAll events are conducted with electric equipment. A preliminary inspection will be conducted at the beginning of each pool and DE to ensure the presence of the following equipment: underarm plastron, weapons, body cords and all appropriate weapons check control marks. Athletes are subject to prohibition from fencing if these conditions are not met. \r\n \r\nWeapons will not be inspected or marked in advance, but failure to have the proper number of working weapons and other required equipment at the strip is subject to penalty according to relevant USA Fencing rules. \r\n \r\nYou must arrive at the strip with at least two working weapons and two working body cords. Fencers are responsible for having working equipment prior to arrival for competition. \r\n \r\nNote that the Pro Shop will be open to sell new equipment and repair services, but fencers ultimately are responsible for having all necessary equipment in working order.\r\n \r\nSEEDING: \r\nSeeding is based on the Current National Youth Ranking according to age group and weapon, then your letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification are seeded on a random basis after the fencers who are seeded by the previous criteria. \r\n \r\nNew Jersey Fencing Alliance will ONLY use ratings and points standings that have been forwarded to and accepted by USA Fencing in advance of the tournament and then downloaded by us from USA Fencing. This information will be downloaded on three days before the event. Check your current points at: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings. \r\nCheck USA rating at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Fencers should verify their ratings and point standing prior to the event. Any discrepancies must be resolved with the USFA. Only an official e-mail response from USFA will override the ratings\/points published on the USFA website. \r\n \r\nEach event\u0092s tentative seeding will be posted at the venue and on-line prior to the close of check-in. Final seeding will be posted after close of check-in. It is the fencer's responsibility to notify the Bout Committee of any discrepancies in posted seeding information before pool assignments are posted. Any mistakes in posted information throughout the tournament must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes of posting). This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.\r\n \r\nErrors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes). Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.\r\n \r\nCheck all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy.\r\n \r\nPOINTS AND CLASSIFICATION EARNINGS - will not be awarded for this particular event due to the fact that the NJ Division has not sanctioned this event. \r\n \r\nPhotography and filming is permitted, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWITHDRAWAL: \r\nWithdrawal during pools: If a fencer withdraws, or is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part in the competition. \r\n \r\nWithdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. Note that per USA Fencing rules, fencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n\r\nTOURNAMENT FORMAT\r\nUSA Fencing rules apply. http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695208-rulebook\r\n \r\nFencers who are not present for their bout after having started a competition (for reasons other than a verified medical withdrawal) will be excluded from the competition, and national points and\/or classifications that might have been earned for that competition will not be awarded. Further disciplinary action can be taken by USA Fencing.\r\n \r\nAll events will be one round of pools comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes, with 100% promotion to direct eliminations. Pools of 6 or 7 will be used whenever possible.  100% of the fencers will be promoted to a DE tableau. Direct Elimination Tableau shall be established according to the results of the preliminary pool round. Events with fewer than 11 participants may be two rounds of pools to direct eliminations. There will be no fence off for third place. \r\n \r\nEvents will be mixed if there are less than 6 competitors of either gender.  \r\nEvents that are posted as mixed will be gender-separated if at least 6 fencers of either gender enter the event.\r\n \r\nY10 direct elimination bouts are for 10 touches or end when two periods of three minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period, have passed. The first period ends either at the expiration of three minutes or when 5 hits are scored, whichever comes first. \r\n \r\n(The rules for handling ties in score at the end of regulation, awarding of cards and non-combativity will apply as currently written.)\r\n \r\nFor Y12, Y14 and Junior Events, DE bouts are 15 touch bouts (3 three minute periods with a 1 minute break between). During the 1 minute breaks, ONE person, designated by the fencer (a teammate, coach, or parent), may be on the strip with the fencer.\r\nAWARDS: \r\nIn the Y8 events awards will be given to the Top 8 finishers.  In the Y10, Y12 and Y14 categories the top 3 finishers will receive awards.\r\n \r\nUSA Fencing rules apply as set forth in the USA Fencing Rulebook and as discussed further in the USA Fencing Athlete Handbook (http:\/\/www.teamusa.org\/USA-Fencing\/About-Us\/Manuals.aspx) \r\n \r\nWe realize that there are many new fencers and parents at these events.

Name is NOT required on uniform. Foil mask with conductive bib required.  <I> Fencers arm, equip and clothe themselves and fence at their own responsibility and at their own risk.   Fencers are responsible for ensuring arrival at the strip with working equipment.<\/I>\r\n\r\nREQUIRED EQUIPMENT\r\n<I>Uniforms <\/I>(jacket, pants, knee-high socks, fencing glove):   Standard fencing uniforms; cannot have any rips, tear, or holes.

This means that these events are NR until they achieve C1 level or higher. See USFA ratings chart at: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6264\/Classification_Chart.pdf\r\n\r\n\u0095 SYC Competitions award points to the top 40% of the field regardless of where the cut off occurs, within a pool round of a direct elimination bracket.  For example, if there are 17 fencers in an event, 40% of 17 is 6.8. Only the top 6 finishers, not the top 7 finishers, earn points. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Format for all events is one round of pools with 100% promoted to a direct elimination (DE) tableau. \r\n Pools:  All events will use pools of six or seven whenever possible.  In events with fewer than 11 entrants, the BC may elect to have two rounds of pools followed by 100% promoted to a DE (direct elimination) tableau. There is no fence-off for third place.   One preliminary round of pools is comprised of the standard 5-touch bout in 3 minutes.  100% then advance to DE round.  DE tableau shall be comprised according to the results of the preliminary pool round. \r\n<I>Y10 DE format:<\/I>  10-touch bouts (two periods of 3 minutes, with a one-minute rest between each period). The first period ends either at the expiration of 3 minutes or when the score reaches 5 touches on one side, whichever comes first.  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n<I>Y12 DE format:<\/I>  15-touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute rest between each period). During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n<I> Y14 DE format:<\/I>  15 touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute break between).  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n<I>Cadet DE format:<\/I>  15 touch bouts (three 3-minute periods with a one-minute break between).  During the 1-minute break, ONE PERSON designated by the fencer (team-mate, coach, or parent) may be on the strip with the fencer. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Seeding for SYC pool round is based on the Current National Youth Ranking (as of November 24, 2014) according to age group and weapon, then letter ranking with year classification, then fencers with neither points nor classification. Fencers with equal classifications will be randomized within each classification.   Seeding for CADET  pool round will use National Cadet ranking within classification, then classification\/year.  Only ratings and points standings listed on the USA Fencing website will be used (ratings on FRED at not official). It is the fencer's responsibility to ensure that USA Fencing has properly recorded any necessary changes or corrections prior to this date. No classification or affiliation changes will be made at the event.  Current ratings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/698125-current-membership-listing. Current point standings: http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/page\/show\/695476-current-point-standings.  \r\n\r\n\u0095 Medals awarded to 8th place. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Fencers are responsible for ensuring accuracy of all posted information and must report errors to the bout committee (BC) immediately. This includes club affiliation, division, classification, date of birth, gender, spelling of name, etc.  Errors in posted pool results must be reported to the BC immediately (within 5 minutes).  Once DE round starts and tableau is posted, the pool results are final and no adjustments will be made.  Check all scores before leaving the strip. Fencer signature on pool sheet and DE slip implies accuracy. \r\n\r\n\u0095 Photography and filming is allowed, however NO flash photography is allowed near ongoing competitions. \r\n\r\nWithdrawal during tournament: \r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during pools: The pools must be fenced through the last bout. A fencer who withdraws, or who is excluded, is scratched from the pool, and his results are annulled as if he had not taken part.\r\n\r\n\u0095 Withdrawal during DE: When for whatever reason a fencer cannot fence or cannot complete his bout, his opponent is declared winner of that bout. A fencer who withdraws does not lose his place in the overall classification of the competition.\r\n\r\n\r\n<b>==============================TOURNAMENT PREPARATION GUIDES==============================<\/b>\r\nThese guides have been prepared to help you with understanding fencing and tournaments.\r\n\r\nBeginner's Tournament Guide http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread44882.html (courtesy of fencing.net)\r\nParents Guide to Fencing: http:\/\/www.fencing.net\/forums\/thread38526.html (courtesy of Fencing.net)\r\nUSA Fencing Parent Guidebook: http:\/\/assets.ngin.com\/attachments\/document\/0034\/6319\/USA_Fencing_Parent_Guidebook.pdf\r\n\r\n<b>================================ABOUT COBRA FENCING CLUB=================================<\/b>\r\nLocated at:  629 Grove Street; Jersey City, NJ  (www.cobrafencing.com)\r\n\r\n<I>Steve Kaplan - Club owner\/Coach  <\/I>\r\n\u0095  (U.S. Fencing Coaches Association Fencing Master)\r\n\u0095   1976 U.S. Olympic Team Member \u0096 Sabre.\r\n\u0095   1975 Pan American Games Silver Medalist.\r\n\u0095   4 time U.S. National Team Champion.\r\n\u0095   1971 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) All American \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095   Varsity Head Fencing Coach NYU 1980-1986.\r\n\u0095   Elected to NYU Athletic Hall of Fame 1996.\r\n\u0095   Founded Cobra Fencing Club in 2002.\r\n\r\n<I>Demetrios \u0093Mitro\u0094 Valsamis \u0096 Coach<\/I>\r\n\r\n\u0095   Under-19 U.S. Foil Champion 1979, 1980.\r\n\u0095   Cadet Sabre Champion 1976, 1977.\r\n\u0095   1983 NCAA Foil Champion \u0096 NYU.\r\n\u0095   Foil Coach at Cobra since 2003.\r\n\r\n<I>Raskyrie (Ras) Davidson - Coach<\/I>\r\n\r\n\u0095   2005, 2006, 2007 United States Junior World Team Member\r\n\u0095   2006 World Cadet Saber Bronze Medalist\r\n\u0095   2005 Junior Olympics Cadet Saber Champion \r\n\u0095   2005 Junior Olympics Junior Saber Champion \r\n\u0095   2004 United States National Cadet Saber Champion\r\n\r\nCobra Fencing Club is a member of the NJ Division of USA Fencing (http:\/\/www.newjerseyfencing.org).    \r\nSince Cobra\u0092s inception it has sought to foster the development of youth fencing.

However, any RYC held before the March NAC but AFTER the deadline for entry will NOT be considered for qualification to this tournament.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n2) The Y10 and Y12 events at SN this season will be National Championships. The Y10 path remains participation in an RYC = qualification.  For Y12, the RYC path is the top 50% of the fencers on their Regions point standings will qualify.  Foreign Fencers will be skipped and the next eligible fencer will qualify as these events are now National Championships. The SYC\/NAC NRPS points path remains the same.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n3) The winner of a Y14 RYC will NO longer earn automatic qualification to SNs.  Rather, at the end of the season, the top 25% on each region's list will qualify.  The SYC\/NAC NRPS path remains the same and the division qualifiers for Y14 are still in place. \r\n\r\nEvents will be mixed if there are fewer than 5 fencers in any gender for that age\/weapon.\r\n\r\nPreregistration Closing Date 11\/26\/2014\r\n\r\n2013-2014 Age Classification USFA restriction rules:\r\n\r\n YOUTH 14..........YOUTH 12.........YOUTH 10\r\n 2000-2003.........2002-2005........2004-2007\r\n\r\nEvents Scheduled:\r\n\r\nSaturday, November 29, 2014\r\n9:00 a.m.:  Y14 Foil \r\n2:00 p.m.:  Y14 Epee\r\n1:00 p.m.:  Y14 Sabre\r\n3:00 p.m.:  Y10 Foil\r\n9:00 a.m.:  Y10 Epee\r\n4:00 p.m.:  Y10 Sabre\r\n\r\nSunday, November , 2014\r\n9:00 a.m.  Y12 Epee\r\n12:00 a.m.  Y12 Foil\r\n2:00 p.m.  Y12 Sabre \r\n\r\nPlease note:  The above times are the close of registration.

It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  No Y12 fencers in the team event, sorry.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  If we have a lot of people signed up we may use some imagination in the format; last year, for example, we ran a pool of teams, each round to a multiple of 3 rather than 5, each round to a max of 1 minute rather than 3.  At any rate, it will be a lot of fencing but will not go on until midnight.  \r\n\r\nIt's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gulfcoastfencing.org\/GCwaiverconsent.pdf\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it's about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.  After you cross the railroad tracks look for the college on the left.  Depending on where in Houston you're coming from it's about an hour drive.  We'll have some signs up to direct you to the gym. \r\n\r\nIf you zoom in on google maps, the gym is marked as the \"Wing J\", and you should drive up the far east entry road and park in the lot just north of the Corporate Learning Center and the Children's Center. We'll have signs up, I promise.\r\n\r\nIf you have a GPS, plug in \"500 College Dr., Lake Jackson, TX, 77566\".\r\n\r\nIf you get lost call me on my cell - 979 848 7433\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brazosport College, Lake Jackson TX","address":"500 College Dr.","city":"Lake Jackson","state":"TX","zip":"77566","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":29.048207,"longitude":-95.4101229,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":112133,"tournament_id":28309,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Div2 Women's Epee","short_name":"Dv2WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","authority":{},"age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":4,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-29T12:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":112134,"tournament_id":28309,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Div2 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C1","rating_prediction":"C2","entries":20,"prereg_count":25,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-11-29T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":112137,"tournament_id":28309,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed Random Draw Team Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":"","entries":2,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"Random Draw Team","close_of_reg":"2014-11-29T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28095,"name":"NJ Division Junior Olympics Qualifier","start_date":"2014-11-29","end_date":"2014-11-30","comments":"This Junior Olympic U 17 & U20 qualification tournament is open only to members of the New Jersey Division.

There is also a Y14 Novice Foil event, for fencers who have fenced two tournaments or fewer.\r\n\r\n------------------  Important Info: ------------------- \r\n\r\nTournament: RCFC Youth #3\r\nDate(s): 12\/06\/2014\r\nLocation: Rain City Fencing Center\r\n\r\nEvent Schedule:\r\n\r\nSaturday, December 6th, 2014\r\n9:30 AM - Doors open\r\n10:00 AM - Y8, Y10, Y14 Foil\r\n1:00 PM - Y14 Epee, Y14 Novice Foil\r\n2:00 PM - Y12 Foil\r\n\r\nAll times are close of registration.\r\n\r\nEntry fee is $15 including tax per event.\r\n\r\nExcept for the Youth-8 event, all competitors must be current 2014-2015 competitive members of USA Fencing (or equivalent). You may join USA Fencing or renew your membership for the new season at the tournament, or online at http:\/\/www.usfencing.org\/ (please print your membership card and bring it to the tournament).\r\n\r\nThe Y14 Novice event is for fencers who have never fenced a tournament before, or have only fenced one of our Novice events previously. Fencers will need to upgrade their USA Fencing membership to the Competitive version.\r\n\r\nAll competitors must have full regulation uniform including underarm protector, fencing pants, and long socks. Rain City Fencing Center has limited quantities of equipment available for purchase or rental.\r\n\r\nFencers may rent club electric gear for $15 per tournament (or $25 per month). Bear in mind that club gear is often unreliable for competition. Whether you're using club gear or your own, make sure it's in good working order and your weapons will pass the weight test! Also, all fencers should have two working weapons and two working body cords at the strip with them. Fencers in the Y8 and Y10 foil events must use #2 or shorter blades.\r\n\r\nAll foil fencers at all competition levels must have masks with conductive bibs. RCFC has electric foil masks, mask cords, and retrofit kits for BG \"Olympic\" masks available for sale, but rental of electric masks is VERY limited.\r\n\r\nEpee fencers note: Because a conductive surface can cause an opponent's weapon to ground out, electric foil masks are NOT permitted in the epee event. Two-weapon fencers will need two masks or a mask with an exchangeable bib.\r\n\r\nAge Eligibility\r\n----------------\r\nYouth-8 -- Born 2006-2009\r\nYouth-10 -- Born 2004-2007\r\nYouth-12 -- Born 2002-2005\r\nYouth-14 -- Born 2000-2003\r\n\r\n------------------  To Preregister:  ------------------\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/askfred.net\/Events\/Prereg\/prereg.php?tournament_id=27728\r\nPreregistration closes on 12\/06\/2014\r\n\r\nIf your email program didn't make that URL clickable, copy and paste the whole URL into your web browser.

Competitors, coaches and spectators should behave in a courteous and sportsmanlike manner throughout the event. Poor behavior and\/or harassment of the referees will not be tolerated.   \r\n\r\nReferees make mistakes. good referees make fewer mistakes. Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in.

You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia-NORTH","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108139,"tournament_id":27350,"tournament":"FAP-North Y10, Y14 Sabre & Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Foil","short_name":"U-Y10MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":3,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-12-06T13:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108140,"tournament_id":27350,"tournament":"FAP-North Y10, Y14 Sabre & Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y10 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y10MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y10","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":4,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-12-06T14:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":108141,"tournament_id":27350,"tournament":"FAP-North Y10, Y14 Sabre & Y10 Foil","full_name":"Unrated Y14 Mixed Saber","short_name":"U-Y14MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Unrated","rating":"","rating_prediction":"NR","entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-12-06T15:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":27358,"name":"UFO Jingle Bells Open","start_date":"2014-12-06","end_date":"","comments":"Three Weapon Open for fencers of all ratings.

Medals will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, & 3rd place.\r\n\r\nFencers will also earn points based on where they finish in the event.

Less experienced referees who are being harassed will make LOTS of mistakes.  \r\n\r\nAthletes should already know that sometimes even when they ARE correct the ref will not see it their way;  good coaches and smart parents prepare their competitors for this and help them to work productively despite any adverse conditions rather than encouraging tantrums and badmouthing the referees.    \r\n\r\nPhiladelphia division information at http:\/\/www.phildiv-usfa.org\/ .\r\n\r\n\r\nFAP & SURROUNDINGS:\r\nDoors open one hour before close of check-in. Free parking in lot.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAIT LIST POLICY:\r\nIf the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nNO-SHOW POLICY\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up. If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name goes on a warning list. If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year. If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list. \r\n\r\nOur space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate. If you sign up and then don't show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which is unfair. This means that in the future you will have to compete as a $40 walk-in entry on a first-come, first -serve basis, and take your chances on whether or not you can compete.","venue":{"name":"Fencing Academy of Philadelphia","address":"827 Glenside Avenue","city":"Wyncote","state":"PA","zip":"19095","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":40.0968827,"longitude":-75.1444145,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":30,"name":"Philadelphia","abbrev":"PHIL","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":108124,"tournament_id":27338,"tournament":"FAP-North Div3 Foil","full_name":"Div3 Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"Dv3SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","authority":{},"age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Div3","rating":"","rating_prediction":"E1","entries":0,"prereg_count":8,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2014-12-07T10:00:00-05:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":28389,"name":"Wyoming JO Qualifiers","start_date":"2014-12-07","end_date":"","comments":"State of Wyoming Junior Olympic National Qualifiers: Must medal in gender specific events to qualify.\r\n\r\n$20 for first weapon, $10 for subsequent events.\r\n\r\n$15 late fee for all preregistrations after Nov 28th, 2014 ","prereg_open":"2014-11-03","prereg_close":"2014-12-06","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":true,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"State of Wyoming Junior Olympic National Qualifiers: Must medal in gender specific events to qualify.Must belong to Wyoming Division.

The top 50% (Y12) and 25% (Y14) on each Regions RRPS will earn qualification points to their respective event at that seasons Summer National Championships.
