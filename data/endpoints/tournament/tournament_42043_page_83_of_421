Free parking on street (just not Lancaster). Showers available.  Several nearby restaurants, ranging from good pizza joints and coffeehouses to fancy dining by UPenn campus.  7-Eleven one block away.\r\n\r\n\r\nNovice tournament FAQ - Fencers and parents often want to know:\r\nQ. How long will the tournament take?\r\nA. That depends on how many people show up, what format we use to run the event, and how far the individual fencer advances within the event. Both the format and the time estimates will be announced at the start of the tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I\/ my fencer bring?\r\nA. All fencing equipment, including plastron (underarm protector). Sturdy long pants are an acceptable substitute for knickers and long socks. A USFA card (or money to join - $60 for one year). Entry fees. A water bottle. Lunch and\/or substantial snack food, or money to buy such from the pizza\/ middle eastern restaurant next door. There will be a break between rounds in which to eat.\r\n\r\nQ. So that means that the tournament is dry, not electric?\r\nA. Correct.\r\n\r\nQ. Gee, I don't see many people signed up. Will there really be a tournament?\r\nA. YES! Because novice tournaments are inherently for people who are new to fencing, many have not yet discovered Fred. (Also, the Philadelphia Division is pretty new to Fred and somewhat reluctant in conversion.) There are always late registrations (alas!) and there is always a tournament.\r\n\r\nQ. Are ratings given out at novice tournaments?\r\nA. No.  Because the tournament is \"dry\" and limited to people who have been competing for two years or less, this tournament does not give out ratings.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaiting list policy:\r\nPre-registration limited to first 18 fencers. If the registration is full, send the organizer an email with your phone and hours at which you can be contacted. You will be put on a waiting list and notified by email and\/or telephone (only if you leave your number!) if space opens up. If you do not yet have an account with Fred, please create one, so that the organizer can add you manually.\r\n\r\n\r\nFencing Academy of Philadelphia Pre-registration Policy:\r\nWe are trying to discourage people from pre-registering and not showing up.  If you are listed as pre-registered in the 24 hours before close of check-in and you do not show up, your name will go on a warning list.  If you do so again you will not be able to pre-register for FAP events for the next calendar year.  If you pre-register and cannot show up, simply remove your name from the pre-registration list.  If you\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not sure how to do that, click on the \u00e2\u0080\u009cEmail the Tournament Organizer\u00e2\u0080\u009d link and we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll help you out.\r\n\r\nFAQ for Pre-Registration Policy\r\nQ.  Why on earth are you doing this?\r\nA.  Our space is limited and we are committed to running a smooth, efficient tournament, which means that we are forced to limit how many people can participate.  If you sign up and then don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, you are often keeping somebody else from fencing, which just isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t fair.  We understand that sometimes life throws a curveball and you get sick or something and can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t show up, which is why we allow you to miss once.  Really, though\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not that hard to take your name off the list!\r\n\r\nQ.  What happens if I can no longer pre-register because I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve done so in the past and not shown up?\r\nA.  Just that \u00e2\u0080\u0093 you can no longer pre-register.  That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the only penalty.  You are still welcome to fence the events, but you\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll have to take your chances with showing up at the door.  Some of our tournaments are very popular and if the tournament is full you probably won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be able to fence.  Also, if there is a discount for pre-registration, you will not be eligible for that discount.  \r\n\r\nQ.  FAP used to have some odd business going on with paying $5 to pre-register.  Is that still going on?\r\nA.  No.  That was our previous attempt to get people to only pre-register if they really meant to show up.

ABSOLUTELY READ THESE FOUR BULLETS BEFORE REGISTERING !!!\r\n<ul><li>You absolutely, positively, must be a Metropolitan division member in order to compete in these qualifying events. You must bring your USFA card to the event with you (we will be verifying, on-site, against the latest national membership listing). If you are listed on the USFA's national membership list as belonging to another division, we absolutely, positively, will not let you compete. Who you contacted, what they said, and\/or what mistakes were made by you or the USFA do not matter. Your having missed your own division's qualifying event, or failed to qualify through it, does not entitle you to attend the Metropolitan division's qualifiers. If there is a legitimate issue, make sure the USFA contacts us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com) DIRECTLY.&nbsp;\r\n<li>You must both register and complete online payment to be registered for any of these events. After you complete both, confirm that your name appears under the correct events in the \"Whose Pre-registered\" list in AskFRED. On-site registration for those who didn't register or complete online payment will include an additional $10 late registration fee PER EVENT.&nbsp;\r\n<li>You must show up for any events you register for, even if the number of registered competitors is less than the number of available qualifying spots. Fencers, even those that have registered, who do not appear in time for their events will be scratched and will not be submitted as a qualified competitor to the national office. The number of entered competitors, their placements in the event and\/or the number of available qualifying spots will not be taken into consideration.<li>BE THERE and BE ON TIME.&nbsp;\r\n<li>If you have any problems registering, please immediately contact us (nyacfencing@yahoo.com).<li>As outlined by the USFA, attendance at an out of town school is not a valid excuse.

It will start about 3 pm or so, depending on registration numbers from Women's and Mixed epee.  If you'd like to wait and see how you feel after your individual event to decide on the Team event that's fine, don't feel obligated to sign up for the team event beforehand.  Y12 fencers can fence in the team event if they have at least an E rating.\r\n\r\nIf we do have enough people (6 minimum) signed up for a team event we'll sort you into top, middle and bottom thirds based on results from individual events and the opinion of the bout committee and pull names out of a hat to make up teams on the spot.  It's fun!  Meet some new people, don't be such a wallflower.  You're so shy!  And such a pretty face.  Stand up straight.  That's better.\r\n\r\nAll USFA rules will be enforced.  USFA membership required.  Masks and body cords will be checked before fencing.\r\n\r\nThis event is jointly presented by the Brazosport Fencing Extravaganza and the Galveston Fencing Club.\r\n\r\nIf you are under 18 and your parent\/guardian won't be coming with you to the tournament, you must go here:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/www.gulfcoastfencing.org\/GCwaiverconsent.pdf\r\n\r\nprint off the form, and have a parent or guardian sign it, and bring it with you, or you won't be able to fence.  Won't that be sad?  I think that will be sad.  So print it off and get it signed and bring it with you.  Sorry, your coach cannot sign it in place of a parent.\r\n\r\nDirections:  To Lake Jackson, from Houston:  Take 45 to 288 south.  Pass through Pearland, Sugarland, and Angleton, keep going, it's about 45 miles from Houston.  When you get to Lake Jackson, pass the 2004 exit and take the Oyster Creek exit.  Turn left on Oyster Creek and follow it through town.  Go about 1.5 miles, pass through a number of stop lights.  At some point the street name changes to College Drive, just keep going straight.  After you cross the railroad tracks look for the college on the left.  We'll have some signs up to guide you to the gym.  Depending on where in Houston you're coming from it's about an hour drive.  \r\n\r\nMap:\r\n\r\nhttp:\/\/tinyurl.com\/bcfal\r\n\r\nIf you get lost call me on my cell - 979 848 7433\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"Brazosport College, Lake Jackson TX","address":"","city":"Lake Jackson","state":"TX","zip":"77566","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":29.0620369,"longitude":-95.4882679,"geocode_precision":"zip"},"division":{"id":64,"name":"Gulf Coast","abbrev":"GULF","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":42957,"tournament_id":9898,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Div2 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Dv2MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Div2","rating":"C2","rating_prediction":null,"entries":25,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-11-28T10:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":42958,"tournament_id":9898,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed Random Draw Team Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Random Draw Team","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":42961,"tournament_id":9898,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Women's Epee","short_name":"WE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Women","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"E1","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-11-28T12:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":42962,"tournament_id":9898,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Y14 Mixed Epee","short_name":"Y14MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Y14","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":7,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-11-28T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":44878,"tournament_id":9898,"tournament":"Gobbler's Revenge After-Thanksgiving Epee","full_name":"Mixed Pool Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":5,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"Pool","close_of_reg":"2009-11-28T17:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10154,"name":"Toys for Tots Charity Tournament","start_date":"2009-11-28","end_date":"","comments":"Bring an unwrapped toy valued at $10 or more plus $5 (cash OK) for each entry.

The fencer with theshorter arm shall extend the weapon point towards the opponet's elbow. The opponent shall bend his arm to a right (90 degree) angle with the tip pointing towards the ceiling. The fencer with the shorter arm shall assumethe distance where the tip touches the elbow of the opponent.\r\n\r\nShould the fencer with the shorter arm choose, BOTH fencers shall assume a guard where the fencer with the longer arm sets a similar distance.\r\n\r\nFencers shall keep BOTH feet in this position until the command of \"FENCE\" has been given.\r\n\r\nA wine glass shall be placed 3\/4 inch behind the rear foot of each fencer, (centered bewtween the lateral boundries).  This shall determine a line perpendicular to the lateral boundry and defined as the 'end line'.  \r\n\r\nAt no point in the fencing action, may ANY part of a fencer's foot make contact with, or go behind his end line.  If so, that fencer shall be determined to have lost the bout by a score of 1-0.\r\n\r\nAny placement of either foot by a fencer beyond the lateral boundry of the strip durring a fencing action, shall also cause that fencer to have lost the bout by a score of 1-0.\r\n\r\nWhen called \"on-guard\" by the referee, both fencers shall assume a motionless position with NO engagement of blades, and no point-in-line.\r\n\r\nNeither fencer shall be permitted to have his tip extend beyond the bellguard of the opponent until the command of \"FENCE.\"\r\n\r\nOnce the command of \"ready?\" has been made, any fencer making a motion prior to the command of \"FENCE\", shall be considered to have a Group I 'yellow card' warning for that bout.\r\n\r\nThe bout shall continue for 1 minute or until one fencer scores a valid hit.  \r\n\r\nDouble-touch hits shall be discarded and fencers shall resume the guard positions at the original set distance.  \r\n\r\nIf neither fencer scores with-in the one minuter of fencing time, BOTH fenccers shall be considered defeated with a score of 0-0.\r\n\r\nIn the event that a fencer's glass is moved or tipped by vibration, thereferee shall determine options suitable for defining the rear boundry.\r\n\r\nCurrent fencing rules shall apply in determining all other validpoints scorred and other penalties assesed.\r\n\r\nThe Sabre competition is in the tradition of the Schlager duel.The wine glasses shall define the end line and it will be fenced until a single cut to the mask (without right of way) is scorred. There shall be no other traditional sabre target other than the mask. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe  Organizers reserve the right to modify the tournament format as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 09\/01\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/27\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"San Antonio Fencing Center\/Salle Pou","address":"14034 Nacogdoches Rd (at O'Connor)","city":"San Antonio","state":"TX","zip":"78247","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":68,"name":"South Texas","abbrev":"SOTX","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":40827,"tournament_id":9370,"tournament":"Duel d' Vin","full_name":"Senior Mixed One-touch\/NON-USFA Epee","short_name":"SrMxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"One-touch\/NON-USFA","close_of_reg":"2009-11-29T13:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":44462,"tournament_id":9370,"tournament":"Duel d' Vin","full_name":"Mixed Senior  One-Touch Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"Senior  One-Touch","close_of_reg":"2009-11-29T15:00:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10331,"name":"Tourney de Cuisine II","start_date":"2009-11-30","end_date":"","comments":"Campus Dining Hall","prereg_open":"2009-11-19","prereg_close":"2009-11-30","authority":"USFA","is_fee_required":false,"is_roc":false,"is_baycup":false,"is_visible":true,"is_cancelled":false,"is_accepting_fees_online":false,"more_info":"","venue":{"name":"MUS Dining Hall","address":"6191 Park Avenue","city":"Memphis","state":"TN","zip":"38119","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/Chicago","latitude":35.099635,"longitude":-89.856269,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":61,"name":"Tennessee","abbrev":"TN","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":44608,"tournament_id":10331,"tournament":"Tourney de Cuisine II","full_name":"EUnder U19 Mixed Epee","short_name":"E-U19MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-11-30T17:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"},{"id":44609,"tournament_id":10331,"tournament":"Tourney de Cuisine II","full_name":"EUnder U19 Mixed Saber","short_name":"E-U19MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"U19","rating_limit":"EUnder","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":"2009-11-30T17:30:00-06:00","fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":10325,"name":"RCFC Championship #3 (Epee)","start_date":"2009-12-01","end_date":"","comments":"RCFC presents the third event in our series of in-house championships, the last one before the holidays.
