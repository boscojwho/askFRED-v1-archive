IF you follow the \"bookstore detour\" signs to the old bus loop (which is now used for parking), there is parking there right in front of the SUB. \r\n\r\nParking rates vary depending on where you park.  On evenings and weekends, a flat rate of $4.00 is required upon entry for parkades. Tickets can be obtained at pay machines that accept $2, $1, and $0.25 coins as well as Visa and MasterCard.  \r\n\r\nThis should give you an idea of how much UBC charges for parking: http:\/\/www.parking.ubc.ca\/visitor_rates.html\r\n\r\nIf that lot is full, got to Gate 2 which is immediately north of Gate 1, turn left at the exit of the lot you are in, pass the tall high rises of Gage Towers.\r\n\r\nThe NORTH PARKADE is immediately west of Gage. It's at C-4\/5 on the map. \r\n\r\nThe SUB is the bunker-like building NORTHWEST of the parking lot, and south of the NORTH PARKADE.\r\n\r\nFrom either the north or south doors of the SUB, go up two flights of stairs, and at the top you will see the ballroom right in front of you (to your right, if you came from the south, to your left if you came from the north).\r\n\r\nIt is fairly easy to find.\r\n\r\n\r\n---------- CONTACT US: ----------\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or inquiries about the tournament, please feel free to contact us at: fencingubc [at] gmail [dot] com","venue":{"name":"Student Union Building, Ballroom","address":"6138 Student Union Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","state":"BC","zip":"V6T 1","country":"CAN","timezone":null,"latitude":49.268185,"longitude":-123.249992,"geocode_precision":"street"},"division":{"id":90,"name":"Canada","abbrev":"CAN","auth":"CFF"},"events":[{"id":44364,"tournament_id":9438,"tournament":"Remembrance Day Tournament 2009","full_name":"Senior Mixed Foil","short_name":"SrMxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":17,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":44365,"tournament_id":9438,"tournament":"Remembrance Day Tournament 2009","full_name":"Senior Mixed Saber","short_name":"SrMxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"Senior","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"NR","rating_prediction":null,"entries":12,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]},{"id":9955,"name":"SoCal JO Quals - Junior (U20) Events","start_date":"2009-11-14","end_date":"","comments":"SoCal Division Junior (U20) JO Qual\r\nMust be a current SoCal Division member born 1990-1996.

After the round of pools, the teams will fence in DEs as usual.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have a team, you can still show up to either join a team or form a team. Alternates are allowed, but teams of 3 are preferred.   If you would like to sign up alone to find a team later, PLEASE sign up for the individual event section.\r\n\r\n\r\nFoil registration ends at 9:30am\r\nEpee registration ends at 11:30am\r\nSaber registration ends at 1:30pm\r\n\r\nPrice:\r\n$10\/person for UR\r\n$15\/person for non-UR\r\n\r\nLocation: Spurrier Gym on the University of Rochester campus\r\n\r\nPlease see following link for campus map (choose River Campus)\r\nhttp:\/\/www.rochester.edu\/maps\/\r\n\r\n\r\nPreregistration opens on 10\/24\/2009.\r\nPreregistration closes on 11\/20\/2009.\r\n\r\n\r\n","venue":{"name":"UR Spurrier Gymnasium","address":"","city":"Rochester","state":"NY","zip":"14627","country":"USA","timezone":"America\/New_York","latitude":"","longitude":"","geocode_precision":"none"},"division":{"id":45,"name":"Western New York","abbrev":"WNY","auth":"USFA"},"events":[{"id":43840,"tournament_id":10128,"tournament":"Rochester Team Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Team Foil","short_name":"MxFTm","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":43841,"tournament_id":10128,"tournament":"Rochester Team Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Team Epee","short_name":"MxETm","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":44121,"tournament_id":10128,"tournament":"Rochester Team Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Team Saber","short_name":"MxSTm","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":true,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":44253,"tournament_id":10128,"tournament":"Rochester Team Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Foil","short_name":"MxF","weapon":"Foil","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":44254,"tournament_id":10128,"tournament":"Rochester Team Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Epee","short_name":"MxE","weapon":"Epee","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"},{"id":44255,"tournament_id":10128,"tournament":"Rochester Team Tournament","full_name":"Mixed Saber","short_name":"MxS","weapon":"Saber","gender":"Mixed","age_limit":"None","rating_limit":"Open","rating":"","rating_prediction":null,"entries":0,"prereg_count":0,"is_team":false,"description":"","close_of_reg":null,"fee":"0.00"}]}]}
